abstract={Body mass is a key life-history trait in animals. Despite being the largest animals on the planet, no method currently exists to estimate body mass of free-living whales. We combined aerial photographs and historical catch records to estimate the body mass of free-living right whales (Eubalaena sp.). First, aerial photogrammetry from unmanned aerial vehicles was used to measure the body length, width (lateral distance) and height (dorso-ventral distance) of free-living southern right whales (Eubalaena australis; 48 calves, seven juveniles and 31 lactating females). From these data, body volume was estimated by modelling the whales as a series of infinitely small ellipses. The body girth of the whales was next calculated at three measurement sites (across the pectoral fin, the umbilicus and the anus) and a linear model was developed to predict body volume from the body girth and length data. To obtain a volume-to-mass conversion factor, this model was then used to estimate the body volume of eight lethally caught North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica), for which body mass was measured. This conversion factor was consequently used to predict the body mass of the free-living whales. The cross-sectional body shape (height–width ratio) of the whales was slightly flattened dorso-ventrally at the anterior end of the body, almost circular in the mid region, and significantly flattened in the lateral plane across the posterior half of the body. Compared to a circular cross-sectional model, our body mass model incorporating body length, width and height improved mass estimates by up to 23.6% (mean = 6.1%, SD = 5.27). Our model had a mean error of only 1.6% (SD = 0.012), compared to 9.5% (SD = 7.68) for a simpler body length-to-mass model. The volume-to-mass conversion factor was estimated at 754.63 kg/m3 (SD = 50.03). Predicted body mass estimates were within a close range of existing body mass measurements. We provide a non-invasive method to accurately estimate body mass of free-living whales while accounting for both their structural size (body length) and relative body condition (body width). Our approach can be directly applied to other marine mammals by adjusting the model parameters (body mass model script provided). © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={This paper describes song production by the eastern North Pacific right whale (NPRW, Eubalaena japonica) in the southeastern Bering Sea. Songs were localized in real-time to individuals using sonobuoys. Singers whose sex could be determined were all males. Autonomous recorder data from 17 year-long deployments were analyzed to document and characterize song types. Four distinct song types were documented over eight years (2009-2017) at five distinct locations. Each song type consists of a hierarchical structure of 1-3 different repeating phrases comprised predominantly of gunshot sounds; three of the four songs contained additional sound types (downsweep, moan, and low-frequency pulsive call). Songs were detected annually (July-January); all song types remained consistent over eight years. Two different songs often occurred simultaneously, produced by different individuals; the same song was never detected simultaneously at the same location. The same song type was detected on the same day and time at two distant locations, indicating multiple individuals can produce the same song. These findings provide support that males produce song; it remains unknown if females also sing. NPRW is the first right whale species documented to produce song. Based on current knowledge about song in mysticetes, it is hypothesized that these songs are reproductive displays. © 2019 U.S. Government.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale is one of only three species within the Eubalaena genus, a group heavily targeted by the whaling industry prior to the twentieth century. All three species (Eubalaena australis, Eubalaena japonica and Eubalaena glacialis) are CITES listed (Appendix I), with the latter two species listed as endangered (IUCN, v 2017-1). The mitochondrial genome of the first two species have been sequenced and are publicly available, while E. glacialis was unavailable. Here we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of E. glacialis, while also detailing a straight forward mitochondrial enrichment method that facilitates analysis using next generation sequencing. This method simultaneously allows for efficient sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, while demonstrating quality sequence coverage that is even across the genome. This enrichment illustrates a marked improvement in sequence depth compared to that achieved when performing whole genome sequencing using a standard DNA extraction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Deepening our understanding of whale hunting practices is important from both cultural and biological perspectives. Many cultures practice whaling activities, including the Nuu-cha-nulth Nations of the Pacific Northwest. Nuu-cha-nulth cultural lifeways and laws include great care and respect for these animals that provide so much wealth to their communities. The disruption of this culture by colonial governments, combined with the decimation of whale populations through industrial whaling, led to the loss of traditional whaling activities and a gap between contemporary and historical knowledge and practices. From a scientific perspective, knowledge of current whale populations is compromised by lack of data with regards to abundance and distribution of these populations prior to colonial industrial whaling. Analysis of whale bones from First Nation whaling sites are valuable for addressing both these issues by identifying the species landed by communities in traditional hunts, and by providing a sample of the presence and distribution of whale species before colonial industrial whaling. Genetic analyses of 95 bones collected from 7 traditional whaling sites of Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations in the Pacific Northwest were conducted, as well as 11 bones from a colonial industrial whaling site in the area that operated from 1905 to 1918. Specifically, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome-b gene to identify what species were taken, and in what proportions. We found that 45.4% of the bones were from grey whales (Eschrictius robustus), 43.0% were from humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), 8.1% were from North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica), and the remaining 3.5% were from fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). These results reveal catch compositions of historical hunts, and therefore help to inform our understanding of historic practices and preferences, and provide information on which species were present in these areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Little is known about the winter distribution of the Critically Endangered eastern population of North Pacific right whale Eubalaena japonica (NPRW), but it has been proposed that the eastern Aleutian Islands, specifically Unimak Pass, constitute a plausible migratory route for individuals. This is a major point of concern given the high shipping traffic in this pass. Therefore, a long-term acoustic recorder was deployed in Unimak Pass (2009-2015), and NPRWs were identified using the 'up' and 'gunshot' call types during manual review of data (8188 recorded hours). Calls were grouped into periods of hypothesized migration (Dec-Feb and Mar-May) and other (Jun-Aug and Sep-Nov). Overall, NPRW calling was intermittent and clustered in time, suggestive of a few individuals transiting the area across seasons. Upcalls (n = 31) were detected on 7 d and occurred most often during Dec-Feb, whereas gunshots (n = 465) were detected on 32 d, occurring in all months except February and October. The majority of individual gunshot calls (n = 306) occurred over 3 d in Dec-Feb 2014-15. Because of this pattern, gunshot calling occurred on more days during Jun-Aug, while more individual calls occurred during Dec-Feb. Diel and seasonal trends in hourly call detection rates were absent. Together, these data confirm that NPRW use Unimak Pass both during and outside of the assumed migratory period. Pervasive vessel noise throughout the study highlights near constant potential for interaction with anthropogenic disturbance. Consistently higher vessel noise during Dec-Feb suggests that this species is most vulnerable during the assumed migratory period. © The authors 2018.},

abstract={Codon usage bias (CUB) is extensively found in a wide variety genomes and it is mostly affected by mutation pressure and natural selection. Analysis of CUB helps in studying the evolutionary features of a genome. The SRY gene plays an important role in male reproductive organ and a good candidate to study the evolutionary forces, since little work was reported earlier on this gene. We used bioinformatic methods to analyze the protein-coding sequences of SRY gene in 172 different mammalian species to understand the patterns of codon usage and the evolutionary forces acting on it. We found that the codon bias of SRY gene varies widely across mammals. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value revealed that the codons such as TCG, CCG, CAT, ATT, ACT, GCT, GTT, GCG, GGG and GGT were over-represented. Correspondence analysis indicated that the distribution of codons was more close to the axes indicating that compositional constraints might correlate to codon bias. Z-score analysis on RSCU values of codons identified a set of 11 codons viz. TCT, TTT, CTA, CTC, TAT, CAG, CGT, ATA, ACC, AAT and GTA which differed significantly at p < 0.01 between 5% high and low gene expression datasets. Further, it was evident from the neutrality plot that GC12 was influenced by both mutation pressure and natural selection. From the study we concluded that natural selection played a dominant role, but mutational pressure played a minor role in the codon usage pattern of SRY gene across mammals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During dedicated surveys for the Critically Endangered eastern stock of North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica (NPRW) in the Bering Sea, focal follows (FFs) were combined with passive acoustic monitoring to correlate vocal activity with dive behavior. During FFs, impulsive gunshot calls (hereafter 'gunshots'), similar to those produced by other right whale populations, were localized to male and female NPRWs. The timing of gunshots correlated strongly with diving behavior observed during the FFs. Log survivorship analysis of inter-blow intervals showed a bout criterion interval of 40 s, separating the data into shorter surfacings and longer dives. For both, gunshots were skewed closer to the end of the sequence (modal gunshot to blow times: 5 s for dives, 7 s for surfacings) than the beginning (modal blow to gunshot times: 22 s for dives, 13 s for surfacings). Gunshots were more commonly produced during dives than surfacings. Mean gunshot calling rate during FFs was 133.0 calls h-1 (range: 38.9-425.0). Other NPRW calls, including upcalls, the predominant call used to identify right whales acoustically, were not detected during the FFs. To determine comparative call detection rates, an additional 180 h of non-FF recordings were analyzed. Gunshots were detected ~50 times more frequently than upcalls (mean: 228.3 vs. 4.3 calls h-1, respectively), with a maximum gunshot calling rate of 835.7 calls h-1. This is the first study to definitively attribute gunshots to NPRW, and demonstrates the importance of including gunshots in passive acoustic studies, which will greatly increase NPRW detectability while supporting more accurate determinations of their spatio-temporal distribution. © The authors 2017.},

abstract={Details are provided on 17 previously unreported catches of blue whales, and 93 catches of North Pacific right whales, all taken illegally by the former USSR. The blue whale catches were made between mid-July and mid-September 1972 in the eastern North Pacific at distances of from 96 to 626 nautical miles from the US west coast (Oregon and Washington); they highlight the inadequacy of the International Observer Scheme, as implemented in 1972, to report or detect illegal whaling. These previously unknown blue whale catches bring the Soviet total to 1,638 for the period 1948–1972. The 93 right whale catches were made during the period 1951–62 around the Kuril Islands, which brings the known total of takes of this species from 1935–1971 to 775 (including 10 taken for scientific research and officially reported at the time). © 2017 International Whaling Commission.

abstract={To effectively protect and manage marine mammals, contemporary information on their abundance and distribution is essential. Several factors influence present-day insight including the accessibility of the study area and the degree of difficulty in locating and studying target species. The offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska are important habitat to a variety of cetaceans yet have remained largely unsurveyed due to its remote location, vast geographic area, and challenging environmental conditions. Between 2009 and 2015, three vessel surveys were conducted using line-transect sampling methods to estimate cetacean abundance and density. Here, we present results on the distribution for all species encountered and density and abundance for six species, including humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), blue whales (B. musculus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), and Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). Fin whales, humpback whales, and Dall’s porpoise were the most abundant species. Beaked whales were documented only in 2015. Prior to this study, recent sightings of blue whales were rare, likely related to the lack of offshore survey coverage. No North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) were sighted, underscoring the critically endangered status of this species in a formerly populous habitat. Although these results provide the first estimates from offshore waters, additional effort is necessary to assess trends and to obtain baseline data for the rare and cryptic species in order to better inform conservation and management actions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (Outside the USA).},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (NARW) (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the world's most threatened whales. It came close to extinction after nearly a millennium of exploitation and currently persists as a population of only approximately 500 individuals. Setting appropriate conservation targets for this species requires an understanding of its historical population size, as a baseline for measuring levels of depletion and progress toward recovery. This is made difficult by the scarcity of records over this species' long whaling history. We sought to estimate the preexploitation population size of the North Atlantic right whale and understand how this species was distributed across its range. We used a spatially explicit data set on historical catches of North Pacific right whales (NPRWs) (Eubalaena japonica) to model the relationship between right whale relative density and the environment during the summer feeding season. Assuming the 2 right whale species select similar environments, we projected this model to the North Atlantic to predict how the relative abundance of NARWs varied across their range. We calibrated these relative abundances with estimates of the NPRW total prewhaling population size to obtain high and low estimates for the overall NARW population size prior to exploitation. The model predicted 9,075-21,328 right whales in the North Atlantic. The current NARW population is thus <6% of the historical North Atlantic carrying capacity and has enormous potential for recovery. According to the model, in June-September NARWs concentrated in 2 main feeding areas: east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and in the Norwegian Sea. These 2 areas may become important in the future as feeding grounds and may already be used more regularly by this endangered species than is thought. © 2015 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={No global synthesis of the status of baleen whales has been published since the 2008 IUCN Red List assessments. Many populations remain at low numbers from historical commercial whaling, which had ceased for all but a few by 1989. Fishing gear entanglement and ship strikes are the most severe current threats. The acute and long-term effects of anthropogenic noise and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors are of concern but poorly understood. The looming consequences of climate change and ocean acidification remain difficult to characterize. North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the species listed as Endangered. Southern right, bowhead, and gray whales have been assessed as Least Concern but some subpopulations of these species - western North Pacific gray whales, Chile-Peru right whales, and Svalbard/Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk bowhead whales - remain at low levels and are either Endangered or Critically Endangered. Eastern North Pacific blue whales have reportedly recovered, but Antarctic blue whales remain at about 1% of pre-exploitation levels. Small isolated subspecies or subpopulations, such as northern Indian Ocean blue whales, Arabian Sea humpback whales, and Mediterranean Sea fin whales are threatened while most subpopulations of sei, Bryde's, and Omura's whales are inadequately monitored and difficult to assess. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Background: The eastern North Pacific population of right whale (Eubalaena japonica) is considered to be one of the smallest whale populations in the world and is at serious risk of extirpation. During the past century, there have been only six records of North Pacific right whales off the west coast of Canada. All six were taken by whaling operations, the last in 1951. Results: Two independent and extremely rare sightings of North Pacific right whales were made off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, in 2013. We describe observations made of these two whales and include information on prey and genetic identity for one individual. Conclusions: These sightings represent the first time this species has been confirmed in Canadian waters in 62 years, and likely the only time in the last 15 years that the species has been sighted south of the Kodiak Island area, Alaska, in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. It can be concluded that, although extremely rare, the species has not been extirpated from waters off Canada's Pacific coast. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding habitat use of critically endangered North Pacific right whales (NPRWs, Eubalaena japonica) is important to better evaluate the potential effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on this species. Satellite transmitters were deployed on individual right whales in 2004, 2008 and 2009 to investigate whether their space-use patterns in the Southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) were influenced by environmental conditions and to assess habitat use in areas of human interest. Whales were monitored for an average of 40 d (range 29-58 d) between July and October, a period in which they inhabited the SEBS shelf. Individuals tagged in 2008-2009 (cold years) remained in the middle shelf domain, travelled at a slower rate and showed a spatially more restricted habitat use than a whale tagged in 2004 (a warm year). Monte Carlo tests suggested that NPRWs associated with the cold pool (remnant winter water in the bottom layer of the middle shelf domain) during cold years, which is likely due to higher copepod abundance and reduced competition with other copepod predators within the cold pool. Telemetry data indicated that a Critical Habitat designated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service encompasses the main feeding range of NPRWs in the Bering Sea. Two whales briefly visited the North Aleutian Basin, an area previously considered for oil and gas development. Small sample sizes precluded conclusive comparisons of space-use patterns among years with significantly different temperature regimes, but we hypothesize that habitat use in the SEBS varies with these regimes because of concomitant changes in the abundance of the whales primary copepod prey. Long-term evaluation of space-use patterns of NPRWs is required to further understand their habits in the feeding grounds in light of global warming and the potential for increased anthropogenic activities. © 2015 Inter-Research.},

abstract={Aim: To obtain a plausible hypothesis for the historical distribution of North Atlantic right whales (NARWs) (Eubalaena glacialis) in their summer feeding grounds. Previously widespread in the North Atlantic, after centuries of hunting, these whales survive as a small population off eastern North America. Because their exploitation began before formal records started, information about their historical distribution is fragmentary. Location: North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. Methods: We linked historical records of North Pacific right whales (E. japonica; from 19th-century American whaling logbooks) with oceanographic data to generate a species distribution model. Assuming that the two species have similar environmental preferences, the model was projected into the North Atlantic to predict environmental suitability for NARWs. The reliability of these predictions was assessed by comparing the model results with historical and recent records in the North Atlantic. Results: The model predicts suitable environmental conditions over a wide, mostly offshore band across the North Atlantic. Predictions are well supported by historical and recent records, but discrepancies in some areas indicate lower discriminative ability in coastal, shallow-depth areas, suggesting that this model mainly describes the summer offshore distribution of right whales. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the summer range of the NARW consisted of a relatively narrow band (width c. 10° in latitude), extending from the eastern coast of North America to northern Norway, over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, south of Greenland and Iceland, north of the British Isles and in the Norwegian Sea. These results highlight possibilities for additional research both on the history of exploitation and on the current summer distribution of this species. In particular, better survey coverage of historical whaling grounds could help inform conservation efforts for this endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates the challenges and opportunities in using historical data to understand the original distribution of highly depleted species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the seriously endangered status of North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica, an improved understanding of the environmental factors that influence the species' distribution and occurrence is needed to better assess the effects of climate change and industrial activities on the population. Associations among right whales, zooplankton, and the physical environment were examined in the southeastern Bering Sea during the summers of 2008 and 2009. Sampling with nets, an optical plankton counter, and a video plankton recorder in proximity to whales as well as along cross-isobath surveys indicated that the copepod Calanus marshallae is the primary prey of right whales in this region. Acoustic detections of right whales from sonobuoys deployed during the cross-isobath surveys were strongly associated with C. marshallae abundance, and peak abundance estimates of C. marshallae in 2.5 m depth strata near a tagged right whale ranged as high as 106 copepods m-3. The smaller Pseudocalanus spp. was higher in abundance than C. marshallae in proximity to right whales, but significantly lower in biomass. High concentrations of C. marshallae occurred in both the surface and bottom layers of the highly stratified water column, but there was no evidence of diel vertical migration. Instead, occurrence of C. marshallae in the bottom layer was associated with elevated near-bottom light attenuance and chlorophyll fluorescence, suggesting C. marshallae may aggregate at depth while feeding on resuspended phytodetritus. Despite the occasional presence of strong horizontal gradients in hydrographic properties, no association was found between C. marshallae and either fronts or phytoplankton distribution. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={The USSR conducted a global campaign of illegal whaling beginning in 1948. Catch records for Soviet pelagic operations in the Southern Hemisphere (and the northern Indian Ocean) have been largely corrected, but major gaps have remained for the North Pacific. Here, using newly discovered whaling industry reports, corrected figures for Soviet catches in this ocean arc provided. During the period 1948-79, a minimum of 190,183 whales were killed by the USSR in the North Pacific (195,783 if one includes an estimate for sperm whales taken in years for which there arc no true data); of these, only 169,638 were reported to the IWC, a difference of 20,568 whales (26,168 including the sperm whale estimate). Figures were falsified for 8 of 12 hunted species, with some catches over-reported to camouflage takes of illegal species. Revised catch totals (caught vs. reported) arc as follows: blue whale - 1,621 vs. 858; fin whale - 14,167 vs. 15,445; humpback whale - 7,334 vs. 4,680; sperm whale - 153,686 vs. 132,505; sci whale - 7,698 vs. 11,363; North Pacific right whale - 681 vs. 11; bowhead whale - 145 vs. 0; gray whale - 172 vs. 24. Brydc's, minkc, killer and Baird's beaked whale catches were reported correctly. Of all the hunted species, sperm and North Pacific right whales were the most heavily impacted. Major falsifications for sperm whales involved figures for both total catch and sex ratio.},

abstract={Genetic analysis of 49 biopsy samples from North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica in the eastern (48) and western (1) North Pacific revealed 24 individual whales with 7 mitochondrial haplotypes. Three pairs of large and small individuals were identified in the field; genotype analysis indicated that 2 of these could represent mother-offspring pairs; for the third small individual, no sampled female genetically qualified as a potential mother. In aggregate, the population appears to have lost some genetic diversity, though not to the degree of North Atlantic right whales E. glacialis, and males outnumber females 2:1. A comparison of the eastern Pacific samples to a single Russian sample suggested that the 2 populations are isolated to some degree. The effective population size for the eastern North Pacific was calculated to be 11.6 (95% CI: 2.9-75.0), based on the estimated linkage disequilibrium. These results further indicate that this population is at immediate risk of extirpation. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Nonmarket valuation research has produced economic value estimates for a variety of threatened, endangered, and rare species around the world. Although over 40 value estimates exist, it is often difficult to compare values from different studies due to variations in study design, implementation, and modeling specifications. We conducted a stated-preference choice experiment to estimate the value of recovering or downlisting 8 threatened and endangered marine species in the United States: loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), upper Willamette River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi), and smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). In May 2009, we surveyed a random sample of U.S. households. We collected data from 8476 households and estimated willingness to pay for recovering and downlisting the 8 species from these data. Respondents were willing to pay for recovering and downlisting threatened and endangered marine taxa. Willingness-to-pay values ranged from $40/household for recovering Puget Sound Chinook salmon to $73/household for recovering the North Pacific right whale. Statistical comparisons among willingness-to-pay values suggest that some taxa are more economically valuable than others, which suggests that the U.S. public's willingness to pay for recovery may vary by species. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Balaenidae (right whales) are large, critically endangered baleen whales represented by four living species. The evolutionary relationships of balaenids are poorly known, with the number of genera, relationships to fossil taxa, and position within Mysticeti in contention. This study employs a comprehensive set of morphological characters to address aspects of balaenid phylogeny. A sister-group relationship between neobalaenids and balaenids is strongly supported, although this conflicts with molecular evidence, which may be an artifact of long-branch attraction (LBA). Monophyly of Balaenidae is supported, and three major clades are recognized: (1) extinct genus Balaenula, (2) extant and extinct species of the genus Eubalaena, and (3) extant and extinct species of the genus Balaena plus the extinct taxon, Balaenella. The relationships of these clades to one another, as well as to the early Miocene stem balaenid, Morenocetus parvus, remain unresolved. Pliocene taxa, Balaenula astensis and Balaenula balaenopsis, form a clade that is the sister group to the Japanese Pliocene Balaenula sp. Eubalaena glacialis and Pliocene Eubalaena belgica, are in an unresolved polytomy with a clade including E. japonica and E. australis. Extant and fossil species of Balaena form a monophyletic group that is sister group to the Dutch Pliocene Balaenella, although phylogenetic relationships within Balaena remain unresolved. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Whaling records from the mid-1800s provide the largest set of observations with which to conduct a basin-scale analysis of potential North Pacific right whale Eubalaena japonica habitat. Since these data lack the concurrent oceanographic data necessary to investigate the species' habitat characteristics I used ocean climate from a 20th century circulation model to create a suitable set of habitat predictors. My goals were to (1) identify regions of suitable habitat and (2) investigate the processes underlying the species-habitat relationship by (3) examining model performance at different spatial and temporal scales. The results show 2 non-overlapping habitat regions in the subarctic North Pacific, supporting the notion of 2 distinct subpopulations. The analysis also implicates surface temperature and temperature variability as strong indicators of potential right whale habitat. Tests of model performance at different scales strongly suggest that at the basin-scale, right whales use regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurs predictably from year to year). The significance of these indicators decreased at the regional scale emphasising the coupling of scale and process, and thus the need for different predictors at different scales. Comparisons of models built using different subsets of the dependent data showed how hypotheses can be tested and potential biases in observational data can be explored. Analyses of rare species' habitat such as this can provide guidance for more directed survey efforts and help identify areas and processes of potential biological importance. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={We present a method for estimating animal density from fixed passive acoustic detectors, and illustrate it by estimating the density of North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica in the areas surrounding 3 hydrophones deployed in the southeastern Bering Sea in 2001 to 2002 and 2005 to 2006. Input data were the distances to detected right whale calls, estimated using a normal mode sound propagation model, and call production rate, estimated from encounters by survey vessels with right whale groups. Given the scarcity of information about this highly endangered species, we also extrapolate our results to provide a tentative estimate of the total population size in shelf waters of the eastern Bering Sea. This gives a point estimate of 25 animals (CV 29.1%; 95% confidence interval 13-47), which agrees well with what little is known for this species. We discuss the assumptions underlying the method. Obtaining more reliable values requires a larger sample of randomly located hydrophones, together with improved estimates of call rate. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={Call source levels, transmission loss, and ambient noise levels were estimated for North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) up-calls recorded in the southeastern Bering Sea in autumn of 2000 and 2001. Distances to calling animals, needed to estimate source levels, were based on two independent techniques: (1) arrival-time differences on three or more hydrophones and (2) shallow-water dispersion of normal modes on a single receiver. Average root-mean-square (rms) call source levels estimated by the two techniques were 178 and 176 dB re 1 Pa at 1 m, respectively, over the up-call frequency band, which was determined per call and averaged 90 to 170 Hz. Peak-to-peak source levels were 14 to 22 dB greater than rms levels. Transmission loss was approximately 15log10(range), intermediate between cylindrical and spherical spreading. Ambient ocean noise within the up-call band varied from 72 to 91 dB re 1 Pa2Hz. Under average noise conditions, call spectrograms were detectable for whales at distances up to 100 km, but propagation and detection distance may vary depending on environmental parameters and anthropogenic noise. Obtaining distances to animals and acoustic detection range is a step toward using long-term passive acoustic recordings to estimate abundance for this critically endangered whale population. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={The North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) was heavily exploited by both nineteenth century whaling and recent (1960s) illegal Soviet catches. Today, the species remains extremely rare especially in the eastern North Pacific. Here, we use photographic and genotype data to calculate the first mark-recapture estimates of abundance for right whales in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The estimates were very similar: photographic 5 31 (95% CL 23-54), genotyping 5 28 (95% CL 24-42). We also estimated the population contains eight females (95% CL 7-18) and 20 males (95% CL 17-37). Although these estimates may relate to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger. Its precarious status today-the world's smallest whale population for which an abundance estimate exists-is a direct consequence of uncontrolled and illegal whaling, and highlights the past failure of international management to prevent such abuses.

abstract={The North Pacific right whale Eubalaena japonica was heavily exploited throughout the Gulf of Alaska by both historical whaling and 1960s illegal Soviet catches. It is now extremely rare in this region (2 sightings between 1966 and 2003 and passive acoustic detections on 6 days out of 80 months of recordings at 7 locations). From 2004 to 2006, 4 sightings of right whales occurred in the Barnabus Trough region on Albatross Bank, south of Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA. Sightings of right whales occurred at locations within the trough with the highest density of zooplankton, as measured by active acoustic backscatter. Net trawls through a high-density demersal layer (~150 to 175 m) revealed large numbers of euphausiids and oil-rich C5-stage copepods. Photo-identification and genotyping of 2 whales failed to reveal a match to Bering Sea right whales. Fecal hormone metabolite analysis from 1 whale estimated levels consistent with an immature male, indicating either recent reproduction in the Gulf of Alaska or movements between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. Large numbers of historic catches of right whales occurred in pelagic waters of the Gulf of Alaska, but there have been few recent detections in deep water. Given that there is no other location in the Gulf of Alaska where right whales have been repeatedly seen post-exploitation, the Barnabus Trough/Albatross Bank area represents important habitat for the relict population of North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska, and a portion of this area was designated as critical habitat under the US Endangered Species Act in 2006. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={Shore whaling along North America's California and Baja California coasts during 1854-99 was ancillary to the offshore and alongshore American whale fishery, which had begun in the North Pacific in the early 1800's and was flourishing by the 1840's. From its inception at Monterey, Calif, in the mid 1850's, the shore fishery, involving open boats deployed from land to catch and tow whales for processing, eventually spread from Monterey south to San Diego and Baja California and north to Crescent City near the California-Oregon border. It had declined to a relict industry by the 1880's, although sporadic efforts continued into the early 20th century. The main target species were gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, with the valuable North Pacific right whale, Eubalaena japonica, also pursued opportunistically. Catch data are grossly incomplete for most stations; no logbooks were kept for these operations as they were for high-seas whaling voyages. Even when good information is available on catch levels, usually as number of whales landed or quantity of oil produced, it is rarely broken down by species. Therefore, we devised methods for extrapolation, interpolation, pro rationing, correction, and informed judgment to produce time series of catches. The resulting estimates of landings from 1854 to 1899 are 3,150 (SE = 112) gray whales and 1,637 (SE = 62) humpback whales. The numbers landed should be multiplied by 1.2 to account for hunting loss (i.e. whales harpooned or shot but not recovered and processed).},

abstract={In 2008, a preliminary study was conducted to provide information on awareness of cetacean (whale, dolphin and porpoise) conservation issues and the US government's policy on whaling, in a test group of US university students (n = 230). When given a list of whale species, 39% of the participants incorrectly thought that the humpback whale was the most threatened whale species (blue whale: 24.8%; northern minke whale: 20.9%; gray whale: 10.4%). Only 4.8% correctly chose the North Pacific right whale from the list. Only 23.5% of respondents stated that they had heard of the International Whaling Com-mission (IWC), the international body with responsibility for the management of whale species. However, most of those who were aware of the IWC could cor-rectly state its function. The respondents were also asked what they believed the policy was of the US government with respect to hunting whales: 40% be-lieved that the US government was opposed to all whale hunting; 32.2% stated that only aboriginal whaling was supported; 23.5% stated that the US govern-ment supported sustainable commercial whaling; and 3.9% believed it sup-ported all forms of commercial whaling. A lack of awareness of the conservation status of whales and the US policy towards whaling suggests that greater out-reach to the public, particularly 18-26-year-olds, about the conservation status of whale species is required, by environmental groups and agencies. © ISAZ 2010 PRINTED IN THE UK.},

abstract={The eastern North Pacific population of right whales (Eubalaena japonica) is among the most endangered whale populations, with an estimated size of only 10s of individuals. The effectiveness of measures (e.g., protected areas, abundance surveys) intended to promote recovery of this population will be enhanced by understanding its distribution, habitat use, and habitat characteristics. In order to facilitate such understanding, we summarized relevant right whale biology, reviewed the life history of their zooplankton prey species, and related North Pacific oceanography to the production, distribution, and concentration of these prey at three scales of variability. We discuss how ocean processes may drive zooplankton distribution and concentration, and present hypotheses about how prey patches suitable for right whale foraging might be formed. Such hypotheses, combined with available distributional data and descriptions of the ocean environment, would be suitable for predicting potential right whale foraging habitat. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Gray whales once had a fairly extensive distribution in the Sea of Okhotsk but little detailed information has been published on when and where they occurred. Open-boat, ship-based whalers from the United States and a few other countries conducted an intensive hunt for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1840s to 1870s. According to entries in voyage logbooks, the American whalers regularly encountered (and sometimes hunted) gray whales in the far northeastern corner of the Okhotsk Sea (Shelikhov Bay, Gizhiginskaya Bay and Penzhinskaya Gulf) between early May-late August. They also observed gray whales in summer along the northern coast of the sea (especially Tauskaya Bay), around the Shantar Islands, in Sakhalin Bay, off Cape Elizabeth at the northern tip of Sakhalin Island and along the west coast of the Kamchatka peninsula. No evidence was found in the logbooks studied of gray whales (and indeed of whaling effort) off northeastern Sakhalin Island where most observations of gray whales occur in the present day.},

abstract={We assessed North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) seasonal and daily calling patterns in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) using long-term hydrophone recordings from October 2000 through January 2006. We detected right whale calls on the SEBS middle shelf (<100 m depth) as early as May, intermittently throughout summer and fall, and as late as December. Calls also were detected on one day in June 2005 on the SEBS slope (>1,000 m), but were not detected near Kodiak Island from April to August 2003. In months with calls, detections occurred on more days in July-October (≥6 d/mo), than from May to June or November to December (≤3 d/mo). Calls were clustered in time and were usually detected on 1-3 consecutive days with a median interval of 6.5 d for calls >1 d apart. Hourly calling rates were significantly higher at night than during the day. These data indicate that right whales occur in the SEBS later in the year than previously known, intermittently pass through the middle-shelf study region, and usually remain there no longer than a few days. Right whale habitat use in the SEBS may intensify in mid-summer through early fall based on higher monthly and daily call detection rates. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Fisheries records provide some of the only information on pre-fishing distribution and abundance for species that were depleted before the advent of modern scientific investigations. This paper interprets records of the early history of whaling for North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena pacifica). The current population occupies only a fraction of its historical range. Historical distributions of several whale species have been inferred from charts prepared by Matthew Fontaine Maury in the early 1850s and Charles Haskins Townsend in the 1930s based on data from American whalers' logbooks. In the North Pacific, Maury's chart has been interpreted to show that right whales occurred continuously across the entire basin. However, we find plotting errors when we compare the North Pacific chart to the corresponding data worksheets prepared for Maury (the 'Maury Abstracts') and the chart appears to have misled historians and biologists. Although these charts and those in the North Atlantic are wrong, the Maury Abstracts themselves appear largely consistent with the original whaler logbooks. Our analysis shows that right whales were likely not distributed continuously across the North Pacific, but instead had a pronounced longitudinally bimodal distribution and were encountered infrequently in the central-northern North Pacific. This work shows how valuable information can be obtained by examining original source material. The American whaling logbooks are extensive and have been largely overlooked in studies of whale populations. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Five species of large whales, including the blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), sei (B. borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and North Pacific right (Eubalaena japonica), were the target of commercial harvests in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) during the 19th through mid-20th Centuries. Since this time, there have been a few summer time visual surveys for these species, but no overview of year-round use of these waters by endangered whales primarily because standard visual survey data are difficult and costly. From October 1999-May 2002, moored hydrophones were deployed in six locations in the GoA to record whale calls. Reception of calls from fin, humpback, and blue whales and an unknown source, called Watkins' whale, showed seasonal and geographic variation. Calls were detected more often during the winter than during the summer, suggesting that animals inhabit the GoA year-round. To estimate the distance at which species-diagnostic calls could be heard, parabolic equation propagation loss models for frequencies characteristic of each of each call type were run. Maximum detection ranges in the subarctic North Pacific ranged from 45 to 250 km among three species (fin, humpback, blue), although modeled detection ranges varied greatly with input parameters and choice of ambient noise level. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Large whales were extensively hunted in coastal waters off Alaska, but current distribution, population sizes and trends are poorly known. Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (B. acutorostrata) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and 6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The North Pacific right whale, Eubalaena japonica, is one of the most endangered species of whale in the world. On 10 August 2004, two right whales were located in the Bering Sea using headings to right whale calls provided by directional sonobuoys. A satellite-monitored radio tag attached to one of these whales functioned for 40 days. Over the 40-day period, this whale moved throughout a large part of the southeast Bering Sea shelf, including areas of the outer-shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades. In September, multiple right whales were acoustically located and subsequently sighted by another survey vessel approaching a near-real-time position from the tag. An analysis of photographs confirmed at least 17 individual whales (not including the tagged whales). Genetic analysis of biopsy samples identified 17 individuals: 10 males and 7 females. The discovery of seven females was significant, as only one female had been identified in the past. Genetics also confirmed the presence of at least two calves. Although the future of this population is highly uncertain, the discovery of additional females and calves gives some hope that this most critically endangered of all whale populations may still possess the capacity to recover. © 2006 US Government.},

abstract={Right whales carry large populations of three 'whale lice' (Cyamus ovalis, Cyamus gracilis, Cyamus erraticus) that have no other hosts. We used sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI gene to ask (i) whether cyamid population structures might reveal associations among right whale individuals and subpopulations, (ii) whether the divergences of the three nominally conspecific cyamid species on North Atlantic, North Pacific, and southern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis, Eubalaena japonica, Eubalaena australis) might indicate their times of separation, and (iii) whether the shapes of cyamid gene trees might contain information about changes in the population sizes of right whales. We found high levels of nucleotide diversity but almost no population structure within oceans, indicating large effective population sizes and high rates of transfer between whales and subpopulations. North Atlantic and Southern Ocean populations of all three species are reciprocally monophyletic, and North Pacific C. erraticus is well separated from North Atlantic and southern C. erraticus. Mitochondrial clock calibrations suggest that these divergences occurred around 6 million years ago (Ma), and that the Eubalaena mitochondrial clock is very slow. North Pacific C. ovalis forms a clade inside the southern C. ovalis gene tree, implying that at least one right whale has crossed the equator in the Pacific Ocean within the last 1-2 million years (Myr). Low-frequency polymorphisms are more common than expected under neutrality for populations of constant size, but there is no obvious signal of rapid, interspecifically congruent expansion of the kind that would be expected if North Atlantic or southern right whales had experienced a prolonged population bottleneck within the last 0.5 Myr. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We investigated the performance of spectrogram cross-correlation for automatically detecting North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) calls in long-term acoustic recordings from the southeastern Bering Sea. Data were sampled by autonomous, bottom-mounted hydrophones deployed in the southeastern Bering Sea from October 2000 through August 2002. A human analyst detected right whale calls within the first month (October 2000) of recorded data by visually examining spectrograms and by listening to recorded data; these manual detections were then compared to results of automated detection trials. Automated detection by spectrogram cross-correlation was implemented using a synthetic kernel based on the most common right whale call type. To optimize automated detection parameters, the analyst performed multiple trials on minutes-long and hour-long recordings and manually adjusted detection parameters between trials. A single set of optimized detection parameters was used to process a week-long recording from October 2000. The automated detector trials resulted in increasing proportions of false and missed detections with increasing data set duration, due to the higher proportion of acoustic noise and lower overall call rates in longer recordings. However, the automated detector missed only one calling "bout" (2 or more calls within a 10-minute span) of the 18 bouts present in the week-long recording. Despite the high number of false detections and missed individual calls, spectrogram cross-correlation was useful to guide a human analyst to sections of data with potential right whale calling bouts. Upon reviewing automatic detection events, the analyst could quickly dismiss false detections and search recordings before and after correct detections to find missed calls, thus improving the efficiency of searching for a small number of calls in long-term (months- to years-long) recordings.},

abstract={1. To help define areas and ecological parameters critical to the survival and recovery of the remnant population of North Pacific right whales, habitat use was investigated by examining all available sighting and catch records in the south-eastern Bering Sea (SEBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) over the past two centuries. 2. Based on re-analyses of co mmercial whaling records, search effort, and resultant catches and sightings, waters of the: (i) SEBS slope and shelf, (ii) eastern Aleutian Islands and (iii) GOA slope and abyssal plain were important habitat for North Pacific right whales through the late 1960s. 3. Since 1980, the only area where right whales have been s een consistently is on the SEBS middle shelf. However, acoustic detections and single sightings have been reported in all other regions except the SEBS slope and oceanic GOA (areas where little, if any, acoustic and visual effort has occurred). 4. Sightings since 1979 were in waters <20 0 m deep which may simply reflect the paucity of search effort elsewhere. From the commercial whaling era to the late 1960s, right whales were commonly seen in waters >2000 m deep, indicating that their distribution is not restricted to shallow continental shelves. 5. North Pacific right whale sightings thr ough the centuries have been associated with a variety of oceanic features, and there is little in common in the bathymetry of these regions. These whales appear to have a greater pelagic distribution than that observed in the North Atlantic, which may be related to the availability of larger copepods across the SEBS and GOA. © 2005 Mammal Society.},

abstract={Both species of northern right whale (North Atlantic, Eubalaena glacialís and North Pacific, Eubalaena japonica) are critically endangered. The overall distribution of these small, migratory populations is not well known, especially outside of summer. Passive acoustic monitoring is a tool that could provide information on locations of whales. Better distributional information will inform management efforts to reduce anthropogenic mortalities caused by both ship strikes and fisheries interactions. Recent research on passive acoustic monitoring is summarised, focusing on developments relevant to detection and classification of right whale calls. Some outstanding research requirements are outlined, including the need for the development of models to investigate the potential for risk reduction from acoustic data. Buoys capable of fully automatic whale vocalisation detection, classification and transmission to shore are currently under development.},

abstract={The shallow and uniform water depth of the eastern Bering Sea shelf results in an acoustic waveguide. Propagation within this waveguide produces waveform dispersion which is dependent upon range. We present a means for using dispersed waveforms to determine range to calling whales from a single autonomous acoustic recording instrument. The predominant North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) call is frequency upswept from about 90 Hz to around 160 Hz and lasts approximately 1 s. The regional bathymetry of the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is relatively uniform and shallow (∼70 meters deep). This geometry provides a plane-layered waveguide in which right whale upswept calls can be detected at ranges over 50 km and have multiple modal arrivals that become dispersed, displaying different propagation velocities for different frequencies. Dispersion characteristics of modal arrivals are dependent on the calling whale's depth, the receiver's depth, the water depth, the range from caller to receiver, and various environmental parameters including water and sediment density and sound velocity. A model of sound propagation for the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is developed from right whale call dispersion recorded on sonobuoys and seafloor acoustic recording packages, using individual calls recorded at multiple instruments. After development of the model, waveform dispersion allows estimation of caller range based on single instrument recordings. Estimating range between instrument and calling whales provides a means to estimate minimum abundance for the endangered North Pacific right whale.},

abstract={The threat to the survival of several whale species and the introduction of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) has highlighted the need for better knowledge about the biology and ecology of marine mammals in Canadian waters. The North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), once plentiful across much of the North Pacific Ocean, is now rarely seen in coastal British Columbian waters, and the number of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in southern British Columbia has been steadily decreasing in recent years. The recovery plan for these species is based on the gathering of baseline data on occurrence, distribution, abundance and habitat, and one significant component of this data collection is based on the deployment of multiple passive acoustical recording systems off the coast of British Columbia. In addition to the development and use of a simple but effective two-hydrophone array, two different autonomous passive acoustical instruments have been developed, one deployable at shore sites and the other for offshore locations. To limit data storage and power requirements, both of these systems have been equipped with killer whale recognition hardware to record only when the probability of killer whales in the area is relatively high. In addition the offshore units have been designed as hybrid recorders, sampling at 1000 Hz for the larger baleen whales and 20 kHz when killer whales are present. Both of these instruments have been designed for deployment periods as long as 12 months and are presently deployed in locations along the BC coast. The analysis of the large data sets from these instruments is a challenge and we are currently investigating the use of neural network algorithms to perform not only species recognition but also, with regards to the killer whale population, clan or group identification. The goal is to adapt these algorithms directly into the self-contained instruments.},
