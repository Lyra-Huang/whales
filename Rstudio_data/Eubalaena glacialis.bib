abstract={Animal movement plays a fundamental role in the ecology of migratory species, and understanding migration patterns is required for effective management. To evaluate intrinsic and environmental factors associated with probabilities of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis migrating to a wintering ground off the southeastern United States (SEUS), we applied a multistate temporary emigration capture-recapture model to 22 years of photo-identification data. Migration probabilities for juveniles were generally higher yet more variable than those for adults, and non-calving adult females were the least likely group to migrate. The highest migration probabilities for juveniles and adult males coincided with years of relatively high calving rates, following years of higher prey availability in a fall feeding ground. Right whale migration to the SEUS can be classified as condition-dependent partial migration, which includes skipped breeding partial migration for reproductive females, and is likely influenced by tradeoffs among ecological factors such as reproductive costs and foraging opportunities that vary across individuals and time. The high variability in migration reported in this study provides insight into the ecological drivers of migration but presents challenges to right whale monitoring and conservation strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={North Atlantic right whale monitoring in Roseway Basin, Canada, is primarily based on short-term (<14 d) visual surveys conducted during August–September. Variability in survey effort has been the biggest limiting factor to studying changes in the population's occurrence and habitat use. Such efforts could be enhanced considerably using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We sought to determine if variation in whale presence, relative abundance, demography, and/or behavior (estimated through visual surveys) could be explained by variation in three right whale call types in this habitat. A generalized linear model was fit to 23 d of concurrent PAM and visual monitoring during four summers within the Roseway Basin Right Whale Critical Habitat boundaries. The model revealed significant positive relationships between relative abundance, call counts and presence of surface-active group behavior. PAM can refine daily right whale presence estimates. While visual observations (n = 23 d) implied a 40% decline in right whale presence during 2014–2015 relative to 2004–2005, PAM data (n = 211 d) showed right whales were present between 71%–85% of survey days throughout all years analyzed. We demonstrate that PAM is a useful tool to extend periods of right whale monitoring, especially in areas where visual monitoring efforts may be limited. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy},

abstract={Mammals with dependent young often rely on cryptic behaviour to avoid detection by potential predators. In the mysticetes, large baleen whales, young calves are known to be vulnerable to direct predation from both shark and orca predators; therefore, it is possible that mother–calf pairs may show cryptic behaviours to avoid the attention of predators. Baleen whales primarily communicate through low-frequency acoustic signals, which can travel over long ranges. In this study, we explore the potential for acoustic crypsis, a form of cryptic behaviour to avoid predator detection, in North Atlantic right whale mother–calf pairs. We predicted that mother–calf pairs would either show reduced calling rates, reduced call amplitude or a combination of these behavioural modifications when compared with other demographic groups in the same habitat. Our results show that right whale mother–calf pairs have a strong shift in repertoire usage, significantly reducing the number of higher amplitude, long-distance communication signals they produced when compared with juvenile and pregnant whales in the same habitat. These observations show that right whale mother–calf pairs rely upon acoustic crypsis, potentially to minimize the risk of acoustic eavesdropping by predators. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={This study aimed at identifying potentially suitable foraging habitats for the North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) in the Gulf of St Lawrence (GSL), on the Scotian Shelf (SS) and in the Bay of Fundy (BoF), Canada, based on the distribution densities of their main prey, Calanus copepod species. More than 4800 historical Calanus spp. water column integrated samples as well as 221 vertically stratified sampling stations were used to create a 3D (latitude, longitude and vertical) climatology of Calanus spp. biomass densities for spring and summer-fall when NARW are feeding in Canadian waters. We then combined this 3D preyscape with bio-energetic considerations to highlight potentially suitable NARW foraging habitats in the region. Our 3D climatological approach successfully identified the known feeding areas of Grand Manan (BoF) and Roseway Basin (western SS), confirming its validity. Expanding our analyses to the GSL and other parts of the SS, we identified in both regions areas previously unknown where Calanus spp. biomass densities exceeded minimum levels suitable for foraging NARW. Our results represent a key contribution to the identification of important foraging areas for NARW in Canadian waters, especially in the context of climate change and the documented shift in NARW distribution. © 2019 Crown copyright 2019.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (NARW), Eubalaena glacialis, feeds on zooplankton, particularly copepods of the genus Calanus. We quantified interannual variation in anomalies of abundance and biomass of Calanus spp. and near-surface and near-bottom ocean temperature and salinity from 19 subregions spanning the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank (GoM-GBK), Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves. We analyzed time series from 1977 to 2016 in GoM-GBK, 1982 to 2016 in southwest GSL and 1999 to 2016 in remaining areas. Calanus finmarchicus dominated abundance and biomass, except in the GSL where Calanus hyperboreus was abundant. The biomass of Calanus spp. declined in many subregions over years 1999-2016 and was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature in GoM-GBK and on the SS. We detected ''regime shifts" to lower biomass of Calanus spp. in the GoM-GBK in 2010 and on the SS in 2011. In the GoM-GBK, shifts to lower biomass of C. finmarchicus coincided with shifts to warmer ocean temperature and with published reports of changes in spatial distribution and reduced calving rate of NARW. We hypothesize that warming has negatively impacted population levels of Calanus spp. near their southern range limit, reducing the availability of prey to NARW. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

abstract={The 2017 North Atlantic right whale (NARW) unusual mortality event and an increase in humpback whale entanglements off the U.S. West Coast have driven significant interest in ropeless trap/pot fishing. Removing the vertical buoy lines used to mark traps on the sea floor and haul them up would dramatically reduce or eliminate entanglements, the leading cause of NARW mortality, while potentially allowing fishermen to harvest in areas that would otherwise need to be closed to protect whales. At the first annual Ropeless Consortium meeting, researchers, fishing industry representatives, manufacturers, conservationists, and regulators discussed existing and developing technological replacements for the marking and retrieval functions of buoy lines. Fishermen and NGO partners shared their experience demonstrating ropeless systems and provided feedback to improve the designs. U.S. and Canadian federal regulators discussed prospects to use ropeless fishing gear in areas closed to fishing with vertical lines, as well as other options to reduce entanglements, and a Massachusetts official shared additional regulatory considerations involved in ropeless fishing in state waters. Sustainable seafood experts discussed consumer market advantages and endangered, threatened, and protected species impacts in sustainability standards and certifications. Moving forward, there is an immediate need to (1) work with industry partners to iteratively test and improve ropeless retrieval and marking systems to adapt them to the specific conditions of the relevant trap/pot fisheries, (2) create data sharing and communications protocols for ropeless gear location marking, and (3) develop regulatory procedures and enforcement capacity to allow legal ropeless gear use. © 2019},

abstract={Passive acoustic monitoring is a common method for detection of endangered North Atlantic right whales. This study reports on the acoustic behavior of right whales on the winter calving grounds to assess their acoustic detectability in this habitat. In addition to known call types, previously undescribed low amplitude short broadband signals were detected from lactating females with calves. The production of higher amplitude tonal calls occurred at lower rates for lactating females than from other age/sex classes suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may be less effective in detecting mother-calf pairs in this critical habitat area. © 2019 U.S. Government.},

abstract={Population estimates of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) put the number of individuals at 458 with the actual number likely being lower due to a recent unusual mortality event. Entanglement with fixed fishing gear is the most significant cause of mortality of North Atlantic right whales. There remains little documentation of how North Atlantic right whales become enwrapped during an encounter with fixed fishing gear. In order to gain a better understanding of how entanglements might occur, an interactive simulator was developed that allows the user to swim a virtual whale model using a standard game controller through a gear field in an attempt to re-create an entanglement. The morphologically accurate right whale model produces realistic swimming motions and is capable of pectoral fin motions in response to user input. Using the simulator, gear entanglements involving the pectoral flippers including ropes wrapping around the body and entanglements involving the tailstock were re-created. Entanglements involving the pectoral flippers with body wraps were more easily generated than entanglements involving the tailstock only. The simulator should aid scientists, fisheries experts, fishing gear designers, and bycatch reduction scientists in understanding entanglement dynamics and testing potential new gear configurations. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy},

abstract={Whales are federally protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act; endangered species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, receive additional protection under the Endangered Species Act. However, their regulations have failed to satisfy conservation and animal welfare concerns. From 1990 to 2011 the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis, NARW) population grew at a mean of 2.8% annually. However, population trends reversed since 2011; the species is in decline, with only 100 reproductively active females remaining. This failure is driven by vessel collisions and increasingly fatal and serious entanglement in fixed fishing gear, whose rope strength has increased substantially. Chronic entanglement, drag, and associated morbidity have been linked to poor fecundity. Genuine solutions involve designating areas to be avoided and speed restrictions for ships and removing fishing trap ropes from the water column. A trap fishing closure for NARW habitat in the Cape Cod Bay (U.S.) area has been in place seasonally since 2015. 2017 mortalities in Eastern Canada elicited substantive management changes whereby the 2018 presence of NARW in active trap fishing areas resulted in an effective closure. To avoid these costly closures, the traditional trap fishery model of rope end lines attached to surface marker buoys has to be modified so that traps are marked virtually, and retrieved with gear that does not remain in the water column except during trap retrieval. Consumer demand for genuinely whale-safe products will augment and encourage the necessary regulatory changes so that trap fisheries conserve target and nontarget species. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

abstract={North Atlantic right whales spend their summer months foraging primarily in American and Canadian Atlantic waters on high-energy-density prey. Here, they rapidly accumulate and store energy obtained within a few months to support future migrations and reproduction while fasting. High drag from their ram-filter foraging strategy places a limit on what prey densities will be energetically efficient to target. Our understanding of the volume of prey-laden water filtered by right whales during a dive or foraging bout, and what information they use to decide to forage or not, has been limited by the difficulties of measuring when they feed at depth, how fast they swim during continuous ram filtration and how often they might swallow accumulated prey. We used 10 DTAG deployments from right whales in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to quantify swimming speeds and estimate the volume of prey-laden water filtered per dive. We used the tag's inertial sensors to evaluate the timing of frequent biomechanical changes that likely indicate the truncation of continuous filtration, and whether the number or timing of these fluking bouts relates to longer feeding dives or other foraging decisions. During foraging dives, right whales descended at 1.4 (±0.2 SD) m/s and slowed to swim at 1.1 (±0.3) m/s while filtering. We found consistent pauses in the fluking behaviour of foraging right whales, every 56 (±22) s. Whales filtered on average 78 (±30) m3 of water per fluking bout and on average 673 (±201) m3per dive. Right whales filter large volumes of water at low speeds with a high duty cycle, but require sufficiently high prey energy densities to compensate for a high-drag foraging strategy. Closely related bowhead whales have a larger gape but swim more slowly, filtering greater volumes with lower drag. Our findings highlight that right whales acquire their energy in a relatively short period of intense foraging; even moderate changes in their feeding behaviour or their prey energy density are likely to negatively impact their yearly energy budgets and therefore reduce fitness substantially.

abstract={Photo identification is an important tool for estimating abundance and monitoring population trends over time. However, manually matching photographs to known individuals is time-consuming. Motivated by recent developments in image recognition, we hosted a data science challenge on the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to automate the identification of endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). The winning solution automatically identified individual whales with 87% accuracy with a series of convolutional neural networks to identify the region of interest on an image, rotate, crop, and create standardized photographs of uniform size and orientation and then identify the correct individual whale from these passport-like photographs. Recent advances in deep learning coupled with this fully automated workflow have yielded impressive results and have the potential to revolutionize traditional methods for the collection of data on the abundance and distribution of wild populations. Presenting these results to a broad audience should further bridge the gap between the data science and conservation science communities. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={As climate trends accelerate, ecosystems will be pushed rapidly into new states, reducing the potential efficacy of conservation strategies based on historical patterns. In the Gulf of Maine, climate-driven changes have restructured the ecosystem rapidly over the past decade. Changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation have altered deepwater dynamics, driving warming rates twice as high as the fastest surface rates. This has had implications for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a critical food supply for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The oceanographic changes have driven a deviation in the seasonal foraging patterns of E. glacialis upon which conservation strategies depend, making the whales more vulnerable to ship strikes and gear entanglements. The effects of rapid climate-driven changes on a species at risk undermine current management approaches. © Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={“If we don't take robust, science-based, coherent measures to protect these highly endangered North Atlantic right whales, we're really playing Russian roulette with the entire future of the Canadian fish and seafood industry,” Fisheries and Oceans Minister Dominic LeBlanc, CBC New Brunswick, 16 June 2018. Governments are required to demonstrate that they manage natural resources in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. Evidence of an environmental conservation problem is often not considered sufficient by government to warrant a change in the way human activities are managed until the problem becomes a societal crisis (e.g., large effects on economics, operations or infrastructure). Governments are then challenged to nimbly implement effective reactionary measures that both solve the problem and protect livelihoods. The mass mortality of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) that occurred over a 3 month period in Canadian waters in 2017 due at least in part to fishing gear entanglements and ship strike is an example of a situation wherein evidence of a growing conflict between whales and humans was not acted upon until it became an emergency. The disaster galvanized a number of recent federal environmental initiatives into a powerful government force that was able to collaborate with many non-government groups in promptly responding to the problem. This led to commendable implementation and enforcement of crisis management measures. However, implementation came after many mortalities had already occurred because management plans were developed extemporaneously. Further, the need for crisis management negatively impacted local communities and industries. The eventual implementation of federal regulations led to zero attributable right whale deaths and a profitable fishery in the area of highest whale densities the following year. This shows that government leaders can act effectively on issues of environmental conservation, but that these actions can be drastic (i.e., requiring significant and rapid change to human activities) if there is a historic lack of action to address chronic conservation problems. Being proactive requires acting in proportion to evidence, using plans that are adaptive, precautionary and based on science. Canada must now look to sustainable, preventative measures to reduce right whale mortality risk. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Understanding the behavioral ecology of a species is fundamental to effective conservation and management efforts. This study quantifies the behavioral ontogeny of North Atlantic right whale mother-calf pairs from birth to weaning spanning three critical habitat areas off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Data from 55 focal follows of 34 mother-calf pairs were collected from 2011 to 2015. Resting behaviors dominated the activity budgets for both mother and calf during the first 5 months, putting them at increased risk of vessel collisions. There was an increase in the proportion of active behaviors (travel, foraging, social activity) in both mother and calf as the calf matured. Importantly, the type of active behaviors, in particular surface skim feeding and surface active social behavior, meant that the risk of vessel collision to the pair did not decrease as the calf matured. Mother-calf right whale pairs showed very low calling rates on the calving grounds, suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may not be an effective mitigation tool during the early months. However, calling rates increase once the pair leave the calving areas with both calf age and activity levels increasing, at which point passive acoustic monitoring becomes valuable. Protective measures need to take these rapid developmental changes throughout calf growth into account to improve the efficacy of protection measures for the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other species where behavioral ecology changes rapidly during maturation. Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.},

abstract={Mysticete whales filter small prey from seawater using baleen, a unique keratinous oral tissue that grows from the palate, from which it hangs in hundreds of serial plates. Laboratory experiments testing effects of oils on material strength and flexibility, particle capture and tissue architecture of baleen from four mysticete species (bowhead, Balaena mysticetus; North Atlantic right, Eubalaena glacialis; fin, Balaenoptera physalus; humpback, Megaptera novaeangliae) indicate that baleen is hydrophilic and oleophobic, shedding rather than adsorbing oil. Oils of different weights and viscosities were tested, including six petroleum-based oils and two fish or plankton oils of common whale prey. No notable differences were found by oil type or whale species. Baleen did not adsorb oil; oil was readily rinsed from baleen by flowing water, especially from moving fringes. Microscopic examination shows minimal wrinkling or peeling of baleen's cortical keratin layers, probably due to oil repelling infiltrated water. Combined results cast doubt on fears of baleen fouling by oil; filter porosity is not appreciably affected, but oil ingestion risks remain. Particle capture studies suggest potentially greater danger to mysticetes from plastic pollution than oil. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Although offshore wind energy development (OWED) offers a much-needed renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels, holistic and effective methods for evaluating environmental impacts on wildlife in both space and time have been lacking. The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7–10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance. © 2019 Best, Halpin.

abstract={Transportation industries can negatively impact wildlife populations, including through increased risk of mortality. To mitigate this risk successfully, managers and conservationists must estimate risk across space, time, and alternative management policies. Evaluating this risk at fine spatial and temporal scales can be challenging, especially in systems where wildlife–vehicle collisions are rare or imperfectly detected. The sizes and behaviors of wildlife and vehicles influence collision risk, as well as how much they co-occur in space and time. We applied a modeling framework based on encounter theory to quantify the risk of lethal collisions between endangered North Atlantic right whales and vessels. Using Automatic Identification System vessel traffic data and spatially explicit estimates of right whale abundance that account for imperfect detection, we modeled risk at fine spatiotemporal scales before and after implementation of a vessel speed rule in the southeastern United States. The expected seasonal mortality rates of right whales decreased by 22% on average after the speed rule was implemented, indicating that the rule is effective at reducing lethal collisions. The rule's effect on risk was greatest where right whales were abundant and vessel traffic was heavy, and its effect varied considerably across time and space. Our framework is spatiotemporally flexible, process-oriented, computationally efficient and accounts for uncertainty, making it an ideal approach for evaluating many wildlife management policies, including those regarding collisions between wildlife and vehicles and cases in which wildlife may encounter other dangerous features such as wind farms, seismic surveys, or fishing gear. © 2019 The Authors.},

abstract={Two copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus, constitute the main prey of endangered North Atlantic right whales in eastern Canadian shelf waters. Estimating the spatial distribution of Calanus spp. and understanding how it changes in response to environmental variability are crucial information requirements for mitigating risks to the right whale population. Here we present a new coupled dynamic model that builds on observations from the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) and statistical modelling of copepod spatial distributions using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The coupled model is initialized with the GAMs climatological abundance and explicitly represents transport of the two species C. finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus via particle tracking, considering Calanus vertical swimming behavior and along-track mortality and temperature-dependent development. Assessment of model performance and the role of advection in determining the modelled Calanus distributions is focused on the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL), an area regularly visited by right whales, and where local Calanus abundance is likely dependent on the seasonal transport from deep upstream areas. The coupled model simulates high Calanus abundance in the sGSL in summer and fall, distinct from the spatial distribution estimated by GAMs, which do not consider the effect of transport in the region. The exercise of building and testing this model allows us to investigate the factors producing high concentrations of late stage Calanus, and in the cases of model-data mismatch, infer important processes that are not adequately represented in the model. The model constitutes an important step forward in the ongoing effort to improve estimates of Calanus availability in the region, guiding future modelling efforts (e.g., a population development model) and potentially informing North Atlantic right whale management. © 2018},

abstract={Aerial surveys can be used to estimate animal abundance, but animals unavailable for detection for portions of the survey can cause biased abundance estimates. Moreover, these biases may be variable owing to changes in behavior. We conducted focal follows to obtain surface and dive times of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) and measured the aircraft field of view; these metrics were combined to estimate availability and correct monthly abundance estimates from 1998 to 2017 generated via distance sampling methodology. We used a general least squares model to test for trends in abundance. Availability varied with month (0.27-0.85), likely linked to changes in the depth of copepod food resources. Detection probability varied across the years (0.43-0.87). Sightings per unit effort and counts of whales were significant, but downward-biased indicators of abundance and availability caused changes in bias over the season. Estimated abundance in CCB increased during the study period (4.9 whales yr-1), and estimated abundance in peak months increased at a faster rate (10% yr-1 for 1998-2017) than for the overall population (2.8% yr-1 for 1990-2010). Accurate abundance estimates are necessary to monitor long-term changes in abundance of right whales in CCB, to understand the importance of CCB relative to other areas, and improve management strategies to protect this endangered species from entanglements in fishing gear and ship-strikes. Failing to correct for seasonal variation in availability results in substantial and variable underestimation of abundance. © 2019.},

abstract={Seventy mortalities of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARW) were documented between 2003 and 2018 from Florida, USA, to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. These included 30 adults, 14 juveniles, 10 calves, and 16 of unknown age class. Females represented 65.5% (19/29) of known-sex adults. Fourteen cases had photos only; 56 carcasses received external examinations, 44 of which were also necropsied. Cause of death was determined in 43 cases, of which 38 (88.4%) were due to anthropogenic trauma: 22 (57.9%) from entanglement, and 16 (42.1%) from vessel strike. Gross and histopathologic lesions associated with entanglement were often severe and included deep lacerations caused by constricting line wraps around the flippers, flukes, and head/mouth; baleen plate mutilation; chronic extensive bone lesions from impinging line, and traumatic scoliosis resulting in compromised mobility in a calf. Chronically entangled whales were often in poor body condition and had increased cyamid burden, reflecting compromised health. Vessel strike blunt force injuries included skull and vertebral fractures, blubber and muscle contusions, and large blood clots. Propeller-induced wounds often caused extensive damage to blubber, muscle, viscera, and bone. Overall prevalence of NARW entanglement mortalities increased from 21% (1970−2002) to 51% during this study period. This demonstrates that despite mitigation efforts, entanglements and vessel strikes continue to inflict profound physical trauma and suffering on individual NARWs. These cumulative mortalities are also unsustainable at the population level, so urgent and aggressive intervention is needed to end anthropogenic mortality in this critically endangered species. © The authors 2019.},

funding_text 1={In the USA, this investigative work was conducted under NOAA Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Permits 932-1489, 932-1905, 17355, and 18786. Canadian investigations were conducted under Section 73 SARA permits issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO-MAR-2016-02 Amendment 1) to relevant Canadian response organizations. Great thanks are owed to the NARW community and specifically the NARWC and its contributing membership for sharing data and expertise. This study only exists because of the work of stranding responders, volunteers, and government partners along the Northwest Atlantic seaboard who handle the overwhelming logistical challenge of towing, landing, transporting, and necropsying these whales. Additional thanks for necropsy and ancillary data are owed to Bob Bonde, Craig Harms, Lynda Doughty, Misty Niemeyer, Kristy Volker, Karen Sayles, Michael Walsh, Mendy Garron, Sean Todd, Jerry Conway, Jack Lawson, Wayne Ledwell, Robert Michaud, Stephane Lair, Stephanie Ratelle, Benjamin Lamglait, Andrew Reid, Wayne McFee, and James Powell. There was extensive support for the 2017 mortality event in Canada and additional people and organizations are acknowledged in the incident report (Daoust et al. 2017). The Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network responded to and provided data regarding entanglements of live and dead NARWs. Scott Landry (Center for Coastal Studies) provided entanglement reconstructions based on postmortem data as well as valuable comments on the manuscript. The aerial survey teams in both the USA and Canada (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Center for Coastal Studies, New England Aquarium, Sea to Shore Alliance, Florida Fish and Wildlife, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and others) provided live whale sightings data and carcass reports and tracking. Thanks to Allison Henry for edits to Table S1. The Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium analyzed and interpreted the fecal glucocorticoid data. Sophie Dennison, DACVR provided CT image interpretation. Thanks to Katie Gilbert and Kirsten Spray for their assistance with data organization and entry into the NARW necropsy database and Ashley Powell for her help with Canadian case study summaries. Gaia Bonini provided the ArcGIS maps. Funding for this case review study was provided in part by a grant from CINAR (NA14OAR432 0158). Necropsy and sample analysis expenses were funded by a combination of stranding network budgets, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, the Government of Canada Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk (MARS), and federal funds from NOAA MMHSRP and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Funding for the US 2017−2018 UME cases was provided by NOAA MMHSRP and UME Contingency Fund.

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (hereafter right whales) have re - cently shifted their distribution away from some protected feeding habitats, which suggests largescale changes in food supply have occurred. Quantifying the nature and extent of the apparent shift is key to exploring this hypothesis and planning or revising conservation strategies. This paper characterizes decadal right whale occurrence in the Bay of Fundy summer feeding habitat using data derived from 7522 h of survey effort collected over 30 yr (1987 to 2016) that yielded 11 483 right whale sightings. Eight occurrence descriptors were derived to quantify temporal variation in right whale presence, encounter rates and time of arrival in the Bay. Time of arrival was modeled using linear and power function models fit to annual discovery curves. Principal component analysis showed 2 modes that explained 58 and 14% of the variation in occurrence, respectively. The first mode captured a significant decline in summertime right whale occurrence beginning in 2010. The second mode captured a decadal-scale cycle in seasonal timing of occurrence, which highlighted a sharp change from early to late occupancy at the turn of the millennium. Annual occurrence during the 2010-2016 period was anomalously low in both the Grand Manan Basin critical habitat and the Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Scheme (shipping lanes), whereas encounters in the region NW of the critical habitat containing Owen Basin and The Wolves islands may be increasing due to a distributional shift within the Bay. We discuss the consequences of these changes for both population dynamics and future conservation of the species. © The authors 2019.},

abstract={This paper contributes to documenting a change in the distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARWs) that occurred in the 2010s, when the whales largely abandoned their traditional summering grounds in the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy/Scotian shelf. Data from a year-round passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) network in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were exploited to build the time series of NARW incursions into this inland sea of the Northwest Atlantic, from June 2010 to November 2018. NARWs visited the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence every year from June to January, until ice freeze-up. The earliest detections were made at the end of April and the latest in mid-January. Call occurrence peaked between August and the end of October. NARW contact calls were not detected at the most upstream station at Les Escoumins, in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary, or at the northeastern connection of Belle Isle Strait with the Atlantic, which was monitored from November 2010 to November 2011. The mean daily occurrence of NARWs in the feeding grounds off Gaspé quadrupled after 2015 compared to 2011-2014. Long-term continuous PAM data provided invaluable information to document this marine mammal distribution shift. © The authors 2019.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) once occurred seasonally in Irish waters but in recent decades their presence has declined. This study reviews the existing literature to develop an understanding of the past distribution of North Atlantic right whales, their abundance, temporal occurrence, interspecies associations and apparent use of Irish waters. Ancillary information supporting these core aims was investigated to provide a context for the historical misidentification of North Atlantic right whales and the development of Irish whaling to evaluate the presence of this species in Irish waters. Records of the species within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), between 1300–1987 were validated based on the available data to three confidence levels: definite, probable and possible right whales. Seventeen records comprising at least 42 individual whales exist (including probable Basque whaling effort from the fourteenth century to the sixteenth century). Of the records available, 52% were considered ‘definitely’ right whales with eight comprising 22 individuals from two early twentieth century and two mid-seventeenth century commercial whaling stations operating in the northwest of Ireland. Six ‘probable’ right whale records involving 15 individuals were identified, including two sightings from the late twentieth century while two ‘possible’ records of five individuals were also noted. The previous importance of Ireland’s north western coastline as a potential early summer feeding area in the Northeast Atlantic for migrating right whales, along with the apparent extirpation of the species in the region are also discussed. © Royal Irish Academy.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis utilize the entire water column and are frequently entangled in ropes from fishing gear. Data from telemetry tags have shown that right whales can swim/feed at or near the seafloor. Because those data are limited, some uncertainty remains regarding the frequency of dives to the seafloor and thus the likelihood of right whale encounters with fishing ropes there. The North Atlantic right whale photo-identification catalog was used to determine the number of sightings of right whales with seafloor sediment on their bodies and the relative frequency and geographic location of those seafloor encounters. Between 1980 and 2016, there were 2053 detections of right whales with 'mud' on their bodies, which represents 2.9% of all sightings (n = 70 593), or 58.2% of all cataloged whales (n = 730). Although muddy right whales were found throughout their range and in all months, 92.7% of all detections occurred in the Bay of Fundy in the summer where there was an average annual detection rate of 7.3%, with a maximum of 26% of sightings in 2010. Mud was found on whales of all age classes including calves of the year, and equally among males and females. These seafloor encounters suggest that any rope resting on, or floating above, the seafloor could pose an entanglement hazard. The use of sinking groundlines likely reduces the risk of entanglements for whales swimming near the seafloor, but may not eliminate the risk for whales making contact with the sediment. © The authors 2019.},

abstract={Exhaled breath analysis is a non-invasive assessment tool that has shown promise in human diagnostics, and could greatly benefit research, management, and conservation of large whales. However, hormone assessment of whale respiratory vapor (blow) has been challenged by variable water content and unknown total volume of collected samples. To advance this technique, we investigated urea (a compound present in narrow range in circulation) as a normalizing factor to correct for blow sample concentration. Normalized progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol concentrations of 100 blow samples from 46 photo-identified North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were more biologically relevant compared to absolute estimates, varying by sex, age class, or individual. Progesterone was elevated in adult females compared with other cohorts and highest in one independently confirmed pregnant female. For both sexes, testosterone was two-fold higher in reproductively mature whales but studied adult females showed the widest variation. Cortisol was present in relatively low concentrations in blow and demonstrated variation between individual whales, suggesting potential for studies of individual differences in adrenal activity. Incorporation of methodologies that normalize sample concentration are essential for blow hormone analysis of free-swimming whales, and measurement of urea could be used to optimize non-invasive physiological assessment of whales. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (NARW), Eubalaena glacialis, were nearly exterminated by historical whaling. Their abundance slowly increased up until 2010, to a maximum of fewer than 500 whales, and since then they have been in decline. We assessed the extent to which the relatively slow increase demonstrated by NARW was intrinsic, and how much could be due to anthropogenic impacts. In order to do so, we first compared calf counts of three populations of Southern right whales (SRW), E. australis, with that of NARW, over the period 1992–2016. By this index, the annual rate of increase of NARW was approximately one-third of that of SRW. Next we constructed a population projection model for female NARW, using the highest annual survival estimates available from recent mark–resight analysis, and assuming a four-year calving interval. The model results indicated an intrinsic rate of increase of 4% per year, approximately twice that observed, and that adult female mortality is the main factor influencing this rate. Necropsy records demonstrate that anthropogenic mortality is the primary cause of known mortality of NARW. Anthropogenic mortality and morbidity has limited the recovery of NARW, and baseline conditions prior to their recent decline were already jeopardizing NARW recovery. & 2018 The Authors Published b the Ro al Societ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License},

abstract={Discussions of pre-Viking trade and production have for many decades focused on products made of precious metals, glass and, to some degree, iron. This is hardly surprising considering the difficulties in finding and provenancing products made of organic matter. In this article we examine gaming pieces made from bone and antler, which are not unusual in Scandinavian burials in the Vendel and Viking period (c. ad 550-1050). A special emphasis is placed on whalebone pieces that appear to dominate after around ad 550, signalling a large-scale production and exploitation of North Atlantic whale products. In combination with other goods such as bear furs, birds of prey, and an increased iron and tar production, whalebone products are part of an intensified large-scale outland exploitation and indicate strong, pre-urban trading routes across Scandinavia and Europe some 200 years before the Viking period and well before the age of the emporia. © European Association of Archaeologists 2018Â This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is unaltered and is properly cited.

abstract={The occurrence of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in Cape Cod Bay was documented during aerial surveys between 1998 and 2013. The seasonal occurrence remained relatively unchanged during the study, spanning the January through mid-May timeframe. The number of individual whales visiting the Bay was positively correlated with the increasing Best Cataloged Estimate (BCE), the number of photographed whales alive, with a maximum in 2011 of 56.9% (n = 277) of BCE. However, the rate of increase in number of individuals during the study was significantly greater than that of the BCE (difference in slope: 12.72; P < 0.01) suggesting that increased visitation to the Bay was due in part to a change in habitat preference. Although the demographic composition of whales observed during the study differed little from that of the cataloged whales, the proportion of calves born in the North Atlantic that were documented in the Bay increased significantly (P < 0.01). Models of random visitation demonstrated an individual preference for or rejection of the Bay by the right whales of the North Atlantic population. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale is one of only three species within the Eubalaena genus, a group heavily targeted by the whaling industry prior to the twentieth century. All three species (Eubalaena australis, Eubalaena japonica and Eubalaena glacialis) are CITES listed (Appendix I), with the latter two species listed as endangered (IUCN, v 2017-1). The mitochondrial genome of the first two species have been sequenced and are publicly available, while E. glacialis was unavailable. Here we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of E. glacialis, while also detailing a straight forward mitochondrial enrichment method that facilitates analysis using next generation sequencing. This method simultaneously allows for efficient sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, while demonstrating quality sequence coverage that is even across the genome. This enrichment illustrates a marked improvement in sequence depth compared to that achieved when performing whole genome sequencing using a standard DNA extraction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were extirpated from the eastern North Atlantic by commercial whaling. Grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) disappeared from the entire North Atlantic in still-mysterious circumstances. Here, we test the hypotheses that both species previously occurred in the Mediterranean Sea, an area not currently considered part of their historical range. We used ancient DNA barcoding and collagen fingerprinting methods to taxonomically identify a rare set of 10 presumed whale bones from Roman and pre-Roman archaeological sites in the Strait of Gibraltar region, plus an additional bone from the Asturian coast. We identified three right whales, and three grey whales, demonstrating that the ranges of both of these species historically encompassed the Gibraltar region, probably including the Mediterranean Sea as calving grounds. Our results significantly extend the known range of the Atlantic grey whale, and suggest that 2000 years ago, right and grey whales were common when compared with other whale species. The disappearance of right and grey whales from the Mediterranean region is likely to have been accompanied by broader ecosystem impacts, including the disappearance of their predators (killer whales) and a reduction in marine primary productivity. The evidence that these two coastal and highly accessible species were present along the shores of the Roman Empire raises the hypothesis that they may have formed the basis of a forgotten whaling industry. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The New York Bight is an extremely busy maritime region, with extensive shipping traffic and commercial fishing activity. It is part of the migratory ranges of a number of cetacean species, and includes threats from ship strikes, noise exposure, and line entanglements. Previous cetacean surveys of the Bight offer limited information on cetacean occurrence and distribution in the region, having been restricted to visual sightings with limited temporal coverage. A passive acoustic monitoring survey was conducted over a 258-day period to broaden understanding of the seasonal occurrences of blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales during late summer, autumn, winter, and early spring. Stationary acoustic recorders were positioned near the entrance to New York Harbour and as a linear transect extending from Long Island to the continental shelf edge. Blue, fin, and right whales were detected on 11%, 100%, and 16% of the survey days, respectively. Blue whales were detected offshore during January, February, and March. Fin whales were detected offshore every day, and less often near-shore. Right whales occurred sporadically during every month, but were most often detected at near-shore recorders between late February and mid-May. Based on the acoustic data alone, it is unclear exactly how these species are using this habitat, although it is clear that they occur in the area longer than was previously thought. Thus, management practices should incorporate this extended seasonal presence to mitigate any effects on the whales from shipping and fishing activities. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are highly endangered and frequently exposed to a myriad of human activities and stressors in their industrialized habitat. Entanglements in fixed fishing gear represent a particularly pervasive and often drawn-out source of anthropogenic morbidity and mortality to the species. To better understand both the physiological response to entanglement, and to determine fundamental parameters such as acquisition, duration, and severity of entanglement, we measured a suite of biogeochemical markers in the baleen of an adult female that died from a well-documented chronic entanglement in 2005 (whale Eg2301). Steroid hormones (cortisol, corticosterone, estradiol, and progesterone), thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)), and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) were all measured in a longitudinally sampled baleen plate. This yielded an 8-year profile of foraging and migration behavior, stress response, and reproduction. Stable isotopes cycled in annual patterns that reflect the animal's north-south migration behavior and seasonally abundant zooplankton diet. A progesterone peak, lasting approximately 23 months, was associated with the single known calving event (in 2002) for this female. Estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, T3, and T4 were also elevated, although variably so, during the progesterone peak. This whale was initially sighted with a fishing gear entanglement in September 2004, but the hormone panel suggests that the animal first interacted with the gear as early as June 2004. Elevated δ15N, T3, and T4 indicate that Eg2301 potentially experienced increased energy expenditure, significant lipid catabolism, and thermal stress approximately 3 months before the initial sighting with fishing gear. All hormones in the panel (except cortisol) were elevated above baseline by September 2004. This novel study illustrates the value of using baleen to reconstruct recent temporal profiles and as a comparative matrix in which key physiological indicators of individual whales can be used to understand the impacts of anthropogenic activity on threatened whale populations. © 2018 Lysiak, Trumble, Knowlton and Moore.},

abstract={Regulations for boaters can help mitigate adverse effects on threatened marine mammals. One management tool to protect endangered North Atlantic right whales is a 460-m distance restriction rule for all vessels. This study is the first effort to analyze factors that influence recreational boaters’ intentions to comply with this regulation. Using the theory of planned behavior, we analyzed 362 mail surveys of recreational boaters using the offshore waters of the southeastern United States. We found that two constructs of the theory significantly explained 58% of the intention to comply with the rule: (1) positive attitude toward the rule and (2) stronger belief that other people are complying. Boaters recommended increasing knowledge about whales to improve compliance, but they were divided with respect to increasing fines for violators to increase compliance. This information can be useful for designing outreach strategies to protect whales. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={For millennia, whales have been used as a food source, initially probably opportunistically, with the use of stranded animals on beaches, and later by active hunting. The Basques pioneered commercial whaling first in the neighbouring Cantabrian Sea (11th century) and then in Newfoundland and Labrador (16th century). The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is believed to have been the main target species of the Cantabrian fleets off the coast of Spain although other large whale species could have occasionally been targeted. At present, no molecular identification study has been performed to corroborate which species constituted the main catch for local whalers. Here we use historical bone remains to identify the main target species of medieval whaling in the Cantabrian Sea (13–18th centuries). Our results confirm the North Atlantic right whale as the main target species in Iberia suggesting that direct hunting could have played a role in the depletion of the species. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The trajectory of development and refinement of communication signals closely map physical and social development in many vertebrate species. Although marine mammals exhibit highly complex and diverse communication signals, asking similar questions about signal development can be challenging when dealing with long-lived species that roam widely at sea. North Atlantic right whales, a large baleen whale species, are intensely studied due to their endangered status. We examine whether right whale acoustic signals vary with the physical and social development of individuals from birth to adulthood using a latitudinal analysis. Data included 986 high-quality calls recorded from 49 individuals of known age spanning from 1 month to 37 years, with two individuals measured at different ages. Calls produced by calves younger than 1 year were easily distinguished by their short duration, a high degree of frequency modulation and a high percentage of nonlinear phenomena. Nonlinear phenomena within calls shifted from disorder (deterministic chaos) to increased control (biphonation and subharmonics) with increasing age. The overall percentage of calls containing nonlinear phenomena decreased with increasing age. Duration of the calls and calling bouts increased in direct correlation with age. Notably there was no clear indication of fixation in any of the measured parameters with age, with directional changes continuing over the entire age range studied. This study presents the first evidence that acoustic maturation does not stop at sexual maturity (∼9 years) in right whales and that refinement of calls continues through adulthood. Clear age-related voice cues have been documented in a range of terrestrial species with increases in call duration often reflecting increased stamina or condition in older adults. This study shows a similar trend in right whale sound production, with changes detectable across three-decade age range of available data. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Copepods of the genus Calanus play a critical trophic role in the North Atlantic ecosystems, where they serve as an important source of energy-rich food for fish and marine mammals, including the endangered North Atlantic right whale. As a strategy for coping with unfavorable near-surface conditions, Calanus enter diapause and migrate to deep water in late summer and fall after feeding and accumulating lipid stores in spring and summer. In order to assess the most important physical drivers of vertical distribution of diapausing Calanus, we synthesized existing depth-stratified abundance data of Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus from the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope regions, spanning Newfoundland in the northeast to the Gulf of Maine in the southwest. Bottom depth strongly constrained the depth and shape of vertical distributions, with distributions becoming deeper and less compact as bottom depth increased. Diapausing Calanus, observed across a broad range of temperature (T) and in-situ density (σ) conditions (T = −1.0 to 14.4 °C, σ = 25.3–28.1 kg m−3), tended to distribute at depths with the coldest temperatures locally available. Over the shelf, diapausing Calanus in the GOM and SS generally did not have access to temperatures considered optimal for diapause (&lt;5 °C), in many cases occurring at temperatures well above this threshold. Diapausing Calanus in both habitats were most commonly below the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), a feature formed through wind-driven mixing during the winter, but this effect was more obvious over the shelf than in slope waters. Our analysis highlights key differences in the vertical distributions of diapausing Calanus over the shelf vs. the slope, having regional implications for ecological dynamics and population persistence in the face of warming temperatures. In general, understanding factors that influence vertical distributions of diapausing Calanus will allow us to more accurately predict how the environmental conditions they encounter while overwintering may shift during climate change, which has implications for survival through diapause, and consequently, shelf-wide population dynamics. © 2018},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, one of the world's rarest mammals, experienced an alarming level of mortality in 2017. The estimated abundance as of 2016 was 451 animals. After 20 yr of relatively steady but slow growth, the population has declined since 2010. Mortality and serious injury from entanglement in commercial fishing gear have had a significant impact on recovery. Despite legal requirements to reduce fishery-related mortality, little or no real progress has been made over the last 2 decades. Here I took a relatively simple approach to estimate what the population trajectory since 1990 might have been under 4 different scenarios of reduced entanglement mortality. Under the best-case scenarios, the population at the end of the time-series would have been 25-30% higher than observed at present. If the population had not experienced nearly 3 decades of increasing entanglement, it could have been much more resilient to a disaster year like 2017. © The authors 2018.},

abstract={Effective conservation of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis requires information about their spatio-temporal distribution. Understanding temporal distribution is particularly important, because a portion of the population migrates between high-latitude summer feeding grounds off the northeastern US and Canadian Maritimes coasts and lower-latitude calving and wintering grounds off the southeastern US coast (SEUS). Here, we modeled SEUS residence patterns using photo-identification data from coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida from 7 winter seasons (2004/2005-2010/2011). We used multistate open robust design models to evaluate effects of reproductive status, demographic group, and environmental conditions on SEUS residence. Model estimates accounted for temporal variation and imperfect detection and provided probabilities of entering the SEUS, staying in the SEUS, and being sighted in the SEUS. We also derived estimates for residence time and seasonal abundance. We observed staggered arrival and departure patterns and demographic differences in residence patterns that are characteristic of a differential migration strategy. Calving females arrived ear liest and, in most seasons, had mean residence periods more than twice as long as other demographic groups. Conversely, adult males arrived the latest and had the shortest residence times. Within-season detection was positively influenced by survey effort, and overall seasonal mean (±SE) detection rate estimates ranged from 0.83 ± 0.08 for non-calving adult females to 0.98 ± 0.02 for calving females. Results provide insights into right whale behavior, biology, and temporal distribution in the SEUS and can be used to evaluate spatially and temporally dynamic management measures. © The authors 2018.},

abstract={The Right Whale Sighting Advisory System (RWSAS) is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries program designed to reduce collisions between vessels and critically endangered North Atlantic right whales. The vessel speed restriction that is part of the RWSAS presents navigation stakeholders with numerous challenges, owing to concerns about increased risks of ship grounding and collisions within ports. In this paper, we present a multi-methodology framework for assessing the impact of the vessel speed restriction on navigational safety. Empirically, we base our discussion in a first-order analysis of ship grounding risk for the Charleston Entrance Channel. Our analysis proceeds in three parts. We begin by using fault and event tree analyses to assess a relevant set of grounding-related event progression and failure probabilities. The influence of alternative vessel speed restrictions on ship grounding risk are then explored via a Bayesian network model that utilises the previously specified fault and event tree models for its partial specification and enumeration. Our analysis suggests that the speed restriction can, under certain reasonable assumptions, be seen to adversely impact the risk of ship grounding accidents in the Charleston Entrance Channel. We conclude with a summary of our findings and recommendations for future research. Copyright © 2017 The Royal Institute of Navigation.},

abstract={Baleen tissue accumulates stress hormones (glucocorticoids, GC) as it grows, along with other adrenal, gonadal and thyroid hormones. The hormones are deposited in a linear fashion such that a single plate of baleen allows retrospective assessment and evaluation of long-term trends in the whales' physiological condition. In whale calves, a single piece of baleen contains hormones deposited across the lifespan of the animal, with the tip of the baleen representing prenatally grown baleen. This suggests that baleen recovered from stranded carcasses of whale calves could be used to examine lifetime patterns of stress physiology. Here we report lifetime profiles of cortisol and corticosterone in baleen of a North Atlantic right whale ('NARW'-Eubalaena glacialis) calf that died from a vessel strike, as well as four southern right whale ('SRW'-Eubalaena australis) calves that were found dead with varying severity of chronic wounding from Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) attacks. In all five calves, prenatally grown baleen exhibited a distinctive profile of elevated glucocorticoids that declined shortly before birth, similar to GC profiles reported from baleen of pregnant females. After birth, GC profiles in calf baleen corresponded with the degree of wounding. The NARW calf and two SRW calves with no or few gull wounds had relatively low and constant GC content throughout life, while two SRW calves with high numbers of gull wounds had pronounced elevations in baleen GC content in postnatal baleen followed by a precipitous decline shortly before death, a profile suggestive of prolonged chronic stress. Baleen samples may present a promising and valuable tool for defining the baseline physiology of whale calves and may prove useful for addressing conservation-relevant questions such as distinguishing acute from chronic stress and, potentially, determining cause of death. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Anthropogenic noise negatively impacts many species. One of the more insidious effects of elevated noise levels is the reduction in area over which animals are able to acoustically communicate, often termed communication masking. This study utilizes modeling approaches to evaluate relative levels of masking for 4 baleen whale species from the combination of current ambient noise conditions and noise from discrete vessels operating in the Stellwagen Bank Nat - ional Marine Sanctuary. Acoustic data were collected using bottom-mounted autonomous recorders. One day was analyzed for each of 5 different species-specific sound types, corresponding to peaks in occurrence of fin and humpback whale songs, humpback whale social sounds, minke whale pulse trains and North Atlantic right whale gunshots. Source levels for animals and 3 categories of vessels were calculated empirically; sound propagation was modeled using Bellhop ray tracing. An agent-based modeling framework was used to calculate changes in communication space (CS) in comparison to reference conditions (10 dB lower than current ambient noise). In these singleday snapshots, current ambient noise and noise from vessels for which automatic identification system (AIS) data were available contribute most heavily to loss of CS, followed by whale-watching and fishing vessels. Right whale gunshots experience the least amount of masking, while fin, humpback and minke whale signals experience masking levels of 80% or more. While these results incorporate several simplifying assumptions, this study further develops the framework by which to comparatively quantify masking, providing information on the relative degree of masking experienced between species and allowing for important insights on the relative contributions of different anthropogenic sound sources. © The authors 2017.},

abstract={Human activities have placed populations of many endangered species at risk and mitigation efforts typically focus on reducing anthropogenic sources of mortality. However, failing to recognize the additional role of environmental factors in regulating birth and mortality rates can lead to erroneous demographic analyses and conclusions. The North Atlantic right whale population is currently the focus of conservation efforts aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Consistent monitoring of the population since 1980 has revealed evidence that climate-associated changes in prey availability have played an important role in the population's recovery. The considerable interdecadal differences observed in population growth coincide with remote Arctic and North Atlantic oceanographic processes that link to the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Here, we build capture-recapture models to quantify the role of prey availability on right whale demographic transitional probabilities and use a corresponding demographic model to project population growth rates into the next century. Contrary to previous predictions, the right whale population is projected to recover in the future as long as prey availability and mortality rates remain within the ranges observed during 1980–2012. However, recent events indicate a northward range shift in right whale prey, potentially resulting in decreased prey availability and/or an expansion of right whale habitat into unprotected waters. An annual increase in the number of whale deaths comparable to that observed during the summer 2017 mass mortality event may cause a decline to extinction even under conditions of normal prey availability. This study highlights the importance of understanding the oceanographic context for observed population changes when evaluating the efficacy of conservation management plans for endangered marine species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Male baleen whales have long been suspected to have annual cycles in testosterone, but due to diﬃculty in collecting endocrine samples, little direct evidence exists to conﬁrm this hypothesis. Potential inﬂuences of stress or adrenal stress hormones (cortisol, corticosterone) on male reproduction have also been diﬃcult to study. Baleen has recently been shown to accumulate steroid hormones during growth, such that a single baleen plate contains a continuous, multi-year retrospective record of the whale's endocrine history. As a preliminary investigation into potential testosterone cyclicity in male whales and inﬂuences of stress, we determined patterns in immunoreactive testosterone, two glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone), and stable-isotope (SI) ratios, across the full length of baleen plates from a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), a North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), all adult males. Baleen was subsampled at 2 cm (bowhead, right) or 1 cm (blue) intervals and hormones were extracted from baleen powder with methanol, followed by quantiﬁcation of all three hormones using enzyme immunoassays validated for baleen extract of these species. Baleen of all three males contained regularly spaced peaks in testosterone content, with number and spacing of testosterone peaks corresponding well to SI data and to species-speciﬁc estimates of annual baleen growth rate. Cortisol and corticosterone exhibited some peaks that co-occurred with testosterone peaks, while other glucocorticoid peaks occurred independent of testosterone peaks. The right whale had unusually high glucocorticoids during a period with a known entanglement in ﬁshing gear and a possible disease episode; in the subsequent year, testosterone was unusually low. Further study of baleen testosterone patterns in male whales could help clarify conservation- and management-related questions such as age of sexual maturity, location and season of breeding, and the potential eﬀect of anthropogenic and natural stressors on male testosterone cycles. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={Stranding records have long been used to monitor marine mammal mortalities and to help identify threats to populations. In coastal areas, marine mammals face numerous anthropogenic threats such as marine traffic and commercial fishing. The objective of this study was to investigate marine mammal stranding records from the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) and the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NWGSL), Quebec, Canada from 1994 to 2008 for evidence of anthropogenic trauma caused by entanglement in fishing gear, ship collisions and gunshots. Of 1,590 marine mammal stranding records, 12% (n = 192) had evidence of anthropogenic trauma, most incidents being reported during summer when activities such as marine traffic, most commercial fishing and recreational boating, occurred and a greater number of species were present in the area. These incidents were classified into five categories (Incidental catch, Ship collision, Severe injury, Gunshot, Other). There were 1,245 mortalities and observations on carcasses suggested that anthropogenic trauma led to the death of 11% (141/1,245) of marine mammals: 14% (87/627) of cetaceans and 9% (54/618) of seals. Mortality of seals due to anthropogenic trauma was low, involving mainly Gunshot for grey (26% or 8/31) and harbour seals (26% or 8/31). Over the study period, marine mammal incidents with evidence of anthropogenic trauma increased significantly, driven by an increase in Incidental catch for two mysticete species, the common minke whale, 42% (39/92) and humpback whale, 13% (12/92) and Other for harbour porpoise 67% (16/24). Ship collision was the most common anthropogenic trauma for fin whales (22% or 8/36) and SLE beluga5 (22% or 8/36). Severe injury was reported for 22% (2/9) of small cetaceans and 78% (7/9) of seals. Evidence from some harbour porpoise stranding records (categorised as Other) suggests illegal hunting, incidental catch, predation or scavenging by grey seals in a marine protected area. The observed increase in Incidental catch of common minke and humpback whales may be due to: (1) a shift in distribution of these two species into the SLE and NWGSL, possibly related to changes in the ecosystem; (2) changes in fishery practices; and (3) an increase in detection of marine mammal strandings. Anthropogenic trauma affecting marine mammals was documented including some species at risk, such as the harbour porpoise, the St. Lawrence Estuary beluga population, blue and North Atlantic right whales, in the St. Lawrence ecosystem including in a marine protected area. This study demonstrates the usefulness of stranding records in helping to monitor human-caused mortality in marine mammal populations. © 2018 International Whaling Commission. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Research into stress physiology of mysticete whales has been hampered by difficulty in obtaining repeated physiological samples from individuals over time. We investigated whether multi-year longitudinal records of glucocorticoids can be reconstructed from serial sampling along full-length baleen plates (representing ∼10 years of baleen growth), using baleen recovered from two female North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of known reproductive history. Cortisol and corticosterone were quantified with immunoassay of subsamples taken every 4 cm (representing ∼60 d time intervals) along a full-length baleen plate from each female. In both whales, corticosterone was significantly elevated during known pregnancies (inferred from calf sightings and necropsy data) as compared to intercalving intervals; cortisol was significantly elevated during pregnancies in one female but not the other. Within intercalving intervals, corticosterone was significantly elevated during the first year (lactation year) and/or the second year (post-lactation year) as compared to later years of the intercalving interval, while cortisol showed more variable patterns. Cortisol occasionally showed brief high elevations (“spikes”) not paralleled by corticosterone, suggesting that the two glucocorticoids might be differentially responsive to certain stressors. Generally, immunoreactive corticosterone was present in higher concentration in baleen than immunoreactive cortisol; corticosterone:cortisol ratio was usually >4 and was highly variable in both individuals. Further investigation of baleen cortisol and corticosterone profiles could prove fruitful for elucidating long-term, multi-year patterns in stress physiology of large whales, determined retrospectively from stranded or archived specimens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Given new distribution patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) population in recent years, an improved understanding of spatio-temporal movements are imperative for the conservation of this species. While so far visual data have provided most information on NARW movements, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used in this study in order to better capture year-round NARW presence. This project used PAM data from 2004 to 2014 collected by 19 organizations throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, data from 324 recorders (35,600 days) were processed and analyzed using a classification and detection system. Results highlight almost year-round habitat use of the western North Atlantic Ocean, with a decrease in detections in waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in summer and fall. Data collected post 2010 showed an increased NARW presence in the mid-Atlantic region and a simultaneous decrease in the northern Gulf of Maine. In addition, NARWs were widely distributed across most regions throughout winter months. This study demonstrates that a large-scale analysis of PAM data provides significant value to understanding and tracking shifts in large whale movements over long time scales. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis suffer from unaccept-ably high rates of ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, but little is known of the role that diving and foraging behavior plays in mediating human-caused mortality. We conducted a study of right whale foraging ecology by attaching tags to whales for short periods of time (hours), tracking their movements during daytime, and repeatedly sampling oceanographic conditions and prey distribution along the whales' tracks. Right whales were tagged from late winter to late fall in 6 regions of the Gulf of Maine and southwestern Scotian Shelf from 2000 to 2010. The diving behavior of the tagged whales was governed by the vertical distribution of their primary prey, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. On average, right whales tagged during spring spent 72% of their time in the upper 10 m (within the draft of most large commercial vessels), indicating the need for expanded ship speed restrictions in western Gulf of Maine springtime habitats. One out of every 4 whales dove to within 5 m of the sea floor during the short time they were tagged, spending as much as 45% of their total tagged time in this depth stratum. Right whales dove to the sea floor in each habitat studied except for one (where only 1 whale was tagged). This relatively high incidence of near-bottom diving raises serious concerns about the continued use of floating ground lines in pot and trap gear in coastal Maine and Canadian waters. © M. F.

abstract={To assess the role that vision plays in the ability of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) to detect its primary prey species, the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus, we have compared the absorbance spectrum of the E. glacialis rod visual pigment, the transmittance spectra of C. finmarchicus carotenoid pigments, as well as the downwelling irradiance and horizontal radiance spectra collected during springtime at three locations in the western Gulf of Maine. The E. glacialis rod visual pigment absorbs light maximally at 493 nm, while microspectrophotometric measurements of the C. finmarchicus carotenoid pigments reveal transmission spectra with minima matching very well with the E. glacialis rod visual pigment absorbance spectra maximum. Springtime spectral downwelling irradiance and horizontal radiance values from the surface waters of Cape Cod Bay and at all depths in Great South Channel overlap the E. glacialis rod absorbance spectrum, allowing C. finmarchicus to appear as a high-contrast dark silhouette against a bright background spacelight, thus facilitating visually guided contrast foraging. In contrast, spectral downwelling irradiance and horizontal radiance at depth in Cape Cod Bay, and all depths in Wilkinson Basin, do not overlap the E. glacialis rod absorbance spectrum, providing little if any useful light for contrast vision. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy},

abstract={Fatal entanglements in fishing gear threaten marine mammal populations worldwide. The management of entanglements of large whales, such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), with commercial fisheries, is a challenge given the species’ small population size, economic consequences of regulations, and the general lack of data on entanglements. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requires development of programs to limit marine mammal entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Following a retrospective look at implementing aspects of the MMPA, a set of guiding principles were developed with associated best practices useful in reducing fatal large whale entanglement in fishing gear. Among these are: 1) involve stakeholders early in the decision making process; 2) establish a transparent management strategy that includes critical needs to guide research; 3) use a variety of tools such as an established process for receiving new information and ideas; and 4) incorporate adaptive management which considers the constraints of dynamic (rapid) changes to some fixed fishing gear. Efforts to reduce worldwide marine mammal bycatch will typically occur in a data-limited environment as experienced with U.S. Atlantic large whale entanglements. The guiding principles will remain as key tools for reducing large whale bycatch in fisheries as they build upon common practices. These insights developed over two decades of management can potentially help others to address similar bycatch problems. © 2017},

abstract={Until now, physiological stress assessment of large whales has predominantly focused on adrenal glucocorticoid (GC) measures. Elevated GC concentrations in feces (fGC) are known to reflect stressful disturbances, such as fishing gear entanglement and human-generated underwater noise, in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, there can be considerable variation in GC production as a function of sex and life history stage, which may confound the interpretation of fGC levels. Additionally, GC antibodies used in immunoassays can cross-react with other fecal metabolites (i.e., non-target steroids), potentially influencing fGC data. Here, aldosterone concentrations (fALD; aldosterone and related metabolites) were measured in fecal samples from right whales (total n = 315 samples), including samples from identified individuals of known life history (n = 82 individual whales), to evaluate its utility as a complementary biomarker to fGC for identifying adrenal activation. Concentrations of fALD were positively correlated with fGCs in right whales (r = 0.59, P < 0.001), suggesting concurrent secretion of these hormones by the adrenal gland. However, fALD levels were less influenced by concentrations of reproductive steroids in feces, minimizing the potential confounder of assay cross-reactivity in samples with highly skewed hormone ratios. Across different life history states for right whales, fALD concentrations showed similar patterns to those reported for fGC, with higher levels in pregnant females (35.9 ± 7.6 ng/g) followed by reproductively mature males (9.5 ± 0.9 ng/g) (P < 0.05), providing further evidence of elevated adrenal activation in these groups of whales. The addition of fALD measurement as a biomarker of adrenal activation may help distinguish between intrinsic and external causes of stress hormone elevations in large whales, as well as other free-living wildlife species, providing a more comprehensive approach for associating adrenal activation with specific natural and anthropogenic stressors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Chromosome instability is a common feature of cancers that forms due to the misrepair of DNA double strand breaks. Homologous recombination (HR) repair is a high fidelity DNA repair pathway that utilizes a homologous DNA sequence to accurately repair such damage and protect the genome. Prolonged exposure (> 72 h) to the human lung carcinogen, particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), inhibits HR repair, resulting in increased chromosome instability in human cells. Comparative studies have shown acute Cr(VI) exposure induces less chromosome damage in whale cells than human cells, suggesting investigating the effect of this carcinogen in other species may inform efforts to prevent Cr(VI)-induced chromosome instability. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of prolonged Cr(VI) exposure on HR repair and clastogenesis in North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) lung cells. We show particulate Cr(VI) induces HR repair activity after both acute (24 h) and prolonged (120 h) exposure in North Atlantic right whale cells. Although the RAD51 response was lower following prolonged Cr(VI) exposure compared to acute exposure, the response was sufficient for HR repair to occur. In accordance with active HR repair, no increase in Cr(VI)-induced clastogenesis was observed with increased exposure time. These results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure affects HR repair and genomic stability differently in whale and human lung cells.

abstract={Two wind energy areas (WEAs), designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, offshore of Massachusetts and Rhode Island were surveyed between October 2011 and June 2015. A total of 969 cetacean sightings of over 10,000 animals were documented during systematic line-transect aerial surveys (67,525 km flown). Twelve cetacean species were documented, including seven odontocete and five mysticete species. Cetaceans were recorded in all seasons demonstrating inter-annual, seasonal, and spatial use of the WEAs. Peak presence occurred in the spring and summer for most species, with the exception of North Atlantic right whales, which occurred primarily in the winter and spring. Right and sei whales were documented regularly throughout the study and in higher numbers than expected. Seasonal estimates of abundance were calculated for seven species, including five baleen whales (fin, minke, humpback, right, and sei) and two dolphins (common and bottlenose). The results suggest the area is a previously underestimated seasonal habitat for cetaceans including several endangered baleen whale species. These data will help inform mitigation strategies for future wind energy development. Climate change effects, increased coastal urbanization, and other factors argue for continued monitoring of cetaceans in the WEAs offshore of New England. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The survival of federally protected North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) requires an immediate reduction in the risk of entanglement in commercial fishing gear. This paper argues that at least a 30% reduction in risk is needed to meaningfully contribute to the conservation of right whales. The argument follows from risk estimates calculated using time and space intersections of right whales and fishing gear in Canadian waters. Almost all the risk occurs during July, August and September (12%, 50%, 37% respectively) and the groundfish fishery contributed the greatest proportion (86%) of annual risk. Given that efforts in the USA to reduce entanglement risk through modified fishing gear have been unsuccessful to date, we address the alternative option of restricting certain fishing gear at times and locations where entanglement risk is elevated. There are many options that Canada could employ to achieve the above risk reduction and our results clearly point to the most effective and efficient action being seasonally restricted fishing in two relatively small regions; the Grand Manan Basin and the Roseway Basin. Fully a third (34%±4%) of the annual risk is associated with these two basins, though fishery catch estimates in the basins are relatively small and declining. © 2017},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) feed during the spring and early summer in marine waters off the northeast coast of North America. Their food primarily consists of planktonic copepods, Calanus finmarchicus, which they consume in large numbers by ram filter feeding. The coastal waters where these whales forage are turbid, but they successfully locate copepod swarms during the day at depths exceeding 100 m, where light is very dim and copepod patches may be difficult to see. Using models of E. glacialis visual sensitivity together with measurements of light in waters near Cape Cod where they feed and of light attenuation by living copepods in seawater, we evaluated the potential for visual foraging by these whales. Our results suggest that vision may be useful for finding copepod patches, particularly if E. glacialis searches overhead for silhouetted masses or layers of copepods. This should permit the whales to locate C. finmarchicus visually throughout most daylight hours at depths throughout their foraging range. Looking laterally, the whales might also be able to see copepod patches at short range near the surface. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Immunoassay of hormone metabolites extracted from faecal samples of free-ranging large whales can provide biologically relevant information on reproductive state and stress responses. North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis Müller 1776) are an ideal model for testing the conservation value of faecal metabolites. Almost all North Atlantic right whales are individually identified, most of the population is sighted each year, and systematic survey effort extends back to 1986. North Atlantic right whales number <500 individuals and are subject to anthropogenic mortality, morbidity and other stressors, and scientific data to inform conservation planning are recognized as important. Here, we describe the use of classification trees as an alternative method of analysing multiple-hormone data sets, building on univariate models that have previously been used to describe hormone profiles of individual North Atlantic right whales of known reproductive state. Our tree correctly classified the age class, sex and reproductive state of 83% of 112 faecal samples from known individual whales. Pregnant females, lactating females and both mature and immature males were classified reliably using our model. Non-reproductive [i.e. 'resting' (not pregnant and not lactating) and immature] females proved the most unreliable to distinguish. There were three individual males that, given their age, would traditionally be considered immature but that our tree classed as mature males, possibly calling for a re-evaluation of their reproductive status. Our analysis reiterates the importance of considering the reproductive state of whales when assessing the relationship between cortisol concentrations and stress. Overall, these results confirm findings from previous univariate statistical analyses, but with a more robust multivariate approach that may prove useful for the multiple-analyte data sets that are increasingly used by conservation physiologists. © The Author 2017.

abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated that some hormones are present in baleen powder from bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales. To test the potential generalizability of this technique for studies of stress and reproduction in large whales, we sought to determine whether all major classes of steroid and thyroid hormones are detectable in baleen, and whether these hormones are detectable in other mysticetes. Powdered baleen samples were recovered from single specimens of North Atlantic right, bowhead, blue (Balaenoptera [B.] musculus), sei (B. borealis), minke (B. acutorostrata), fin (B. physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whales. Hormones were extracted with a methanol vortex method, after which we tested all species with commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs, Arbor Assays) for progesterone, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, representing a wide array of steroid and thyroid hormones of interest for whale physiology research. In total, 64 parallelism tests (8 species × 8 hormones) were evaluated to verify good binding affinity of the assay antibodies to hormones in baleen. We also tested assay accuracy, although available sample volume limited this test to progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. All tested hormones were detectable in baleen powder of all species, and all assays passed parallelism and accuracy tests. Although only single individuals were tested, the consistent detectability of all hormones in all species indicates that baleen hormone analysis is likely applicable to a broad range of mysticetes, and that the EIA kits tested here perform well with baleen extract. Quantification of hormones in baleen may be a suitable technique with which to explore questions that have historically been difficult to address in large whales, including pregnancy and inter-calving interval, age of sexual maturation, timing and duration of seasonal reproductive cycles, adrenal physiology and metabolic rate. © The Author 2017.

abstract={Large whales are frequently entangled in fishing gear and sometimes swim while carrying gear for days to years. Entangled whales are subject to additional drag forces requiring increased thrust power and energy expenditure over time. To classify entanglement cases and aid potential disentanglement efforts, it is useful to know how long an entangled whale might survive, given the unique configurations of the gear they are towing. This study establishes an approach to predict drag forces on fishing gear that entangles whales, and applies this method to ten North Atlantic right whale cases to estimate the resulting increase in energy expenditure and the critical entanglement duration that could lead to death. Estimated gear drag ranged 11–275 N. Most entanglements were resolved before critical entanglement durations (mean ± SD 216 ± 260 days) were reached. These estimates can assist real-time development of disentanglement action plans and U.S. Federal Serious Injury assessments required for protected species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Body condition has been correlated with survival and reproductive success in bothterrestrial and marine mammals, including North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis. Weused photographs of individually identified right whales to assess visual changes in body conditionin reproductive females, adult males, juveniles, and entangled whales. Images from sightingsof individual whales were grouped sequentially by habitat region, and each group of images wasassigned a body condition score of good, fair, or poor based on the dorsal profile posterior to theblowholes. Temporally consecutive groups of images (n = 1496) of 340 individual whales werecompared to investigate the frequency, direction, and minimum timeframe between changes inbody condition. Changes in body condition scores of right whales were significantly influenced bygroup category. Lactating females and severely entangled right whales were more likely toexhibit declining body condition than other groups. Resting females were significantly more likelyto improve in condition than other groups but exhibited the longest timeframe for improving condition.Young juveniles were less likely to improve in condition compared to adult males, butremained in compromised condition less frequently than older juveniles and adult males. Theshortest timeframes between changing body condition scores were 11 d for declining conditionand 12 d for improving condition. This study demonstrates that photographic analysis can detectrapid body condition changes and identifies groups of right whales that are particularly vulnerableto declining condition and delayed recovery from energetically taxing events. © The authors 2017.},

abstract={As human impacts on marine ecosystems escalate, there is increasing interest in quantifying sub-lethal physiological and pathological responses of marine mammals. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to assess stress responses to anthropogenic factors in wildlife. While obtaining blood samples to measure circulating hormones is not currently feasible for freeswimming large whales, immunoassay of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCs) has been validated for North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARW). Using a general linear model, we compared fGC concentrations in right whales chronically entangled in fishing gear (n = 6) or live-stranded (n = 1), with right whales quickly killed by vessels (n = 5) and healthy right whales (n = 113) to characterize fGC responses to acute vs. chronic stressors. fGCs in entangled whales (mean ± SE: 1856.4 ± 1644.9 ng g-1) and the stranded whale (5740.7 ng g-1) were significantly higher than in whales killed by vessels (46.2 ± 19.2 ng g-1) and healthy whales (51.7 ± 8.7 ng g-1). Paired feces and serum collected from the live-stranded right whale provided comparison of fGCs in 2 matrices in a chronically stressed whale. Serum cortisol and corticosterone in this whale (50.0 and 29.0 ng ml-1, respectively) were much higher than values reported in other cetaceans, in concordance with extremely elevated fGCs. Meaningful patterns in fGC concentration related to acute vs. chronic impacts persisted despite potential for bacterial degradation of hormone meta - bolites in dead whales. These results provide biological validation for using fGCs as a biomarker of chronic stress in NARWs. © The author 2017.},

abstract={Recent surveys of wind energy areas offshore of Massachusetts and Rhode Island (USA) have demonstrated that they encompass habitat used by the Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. Prior to 2011, little systematic survey effort had been conducted in the area. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the state of Massachusetts supported 3.5 yr of twice-monthly aerial surveys by the Northeast Large Pelagic Survey Collaborative (NLPSC). Additional survey teams including the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and the Center for Coastal Studies have collected sightings data in the region. Data systematically collected by the NLPSC allowed analyses of monthly sightings rates, sightings per unit effort, and hot spots which provided information on current temporal and spatial use patterns. Abundance estimates for each season-year (i.e. a 3 mo period within a given survey year) were calculated. Behaviors observed included feeding and surface active groups. Photo-identification of whales since 2010 yielded a minimum count of 196 unique individuals (annual average = 35), or over one-third of the current population estimate. Analyses of demographics of these individuals revealed that 34 known calving females (30% of the total currently presumed alive) visited the study area. These results demonstrate consistent annual use of this area by a significant portion of the E. glacialis population, with a strong correlation between season and presence. These findings can inform management activities and development planning, and be used as a baseline dataset for assessing long-term impacts to the species. © The authors 2017.},

abstract={In 1941, Abel established Balaena belgica based on a series of fused cervical vertebrae and citing other cranial fragments from the late Neogene of the Antwerp harbor (northern Belgium). Later, Plisnier-Ladame & Quinet (1969) added a neurocranium and other skeletal remains from the same area to this species. Recently, the neurocranium was re-assigned to the genus Eubalaena thanks to newer phylogenetic analyses. Here, a new description is provided of materials previously assigned to "Balaena" belgica together with taxonomic revisions. Our work suggests that the cervical complex originally designated as the type of "Balaena" belgica is too poorly preserved to be used as such and is assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet., thus making "Balaena" belgica a nomen dubium. In addition to the neurocranium, the other remains consist in a fragment of maxilla assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet. and in a humerus assigned to Eubalaena sp. Discovered in the Kruisschans Sands Member of the Lillo Formation (3.2-2.8 Ma, Piacenzian, Late Pliocene), the neurocranium is designated as the holotype of the new species Eubalaena ianitrix. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a sister-group relationship of Eubalaena ianitrix and Eubalaena glacialis, and helps constraining the ages of origin for balaenid clades. Ecological and phylogenetic data suggest that Eubalaena ianitrix may represent the direct ancestor of Eubalaena glacialis, the latter having evolved through phyletic transformation including body size increase during the temperature decline of the Late Pliocene. © 2017 Bisconti et al.},

abstract={Marine mammals are streamlined for efficient movement in their relatively viscous fluid environment and are able to alter their kinematics (i.e. fluke stroke frequency, amplitude, or both) in response to changes in force balance. Entanglement in fishing gear adds significant drag and buoyant forces that can impact swimming behaviors across a range of timescales. We deployed biologging tags during the disentanglement of 2 North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis to (1) examine how their kinematics changed in response to drag and buoyancy from entanglement in fishing gear, and (2) calculate resultant changes in swimming efficiency for one individual. We observed variable responses in dive behavior, but neither whale appeared to exploit added buoyancy to reduce energy expenditure. While some of the observed changes in behavior were individually specific, some swimming kinematics were consistently modulated in response to high drag and buoyancy associated with entangling gear, affecting thrust production. In high drag and buoyancy conditions, fluke strokes were significantly shorter and more variable in shape, and gliding was less frequent. Thrust and efficiency significantly differed among dive phases. Disentanglement reduced thrust coefficients ~4-fold, leading to 1.2 to 1.8-fold lower power (W). Ideal propulsive efficiency was significantly lower when entangled, though we detected no difference in observed propulsive efficiency between the conditions. Similar to carrying heavy objects or changing shoes, we present another condition where animals perceive unique movement constraints over seconds to minutes and develop compensatory strategies, altering their movement accordingly. © The authors 2017.},

abstract={Individuals store energy to balance deficits in natural cycles; however, unnatural events can also lead to unbalanced energy budgets. Entanglement in fishing gear is one example of an unnatural but relatively common circumstance that imposes energetic demands of a similar order of magnitude and duration of life-history events such as migration and pregnancy in large whales. We present two complementary bioenergetic approaches to estimate the energy associated with entanglement in North Atlantic right whales, and compare these estimates to the natural energetic life history of individual whales. Differences in measured blubber thicknesses and estimated blubber volumes between normal and entangled, emaciated whales indicate between 7.4 × 1010 J and 1.2 × 1011 J of energy are consumed during the course to death of a lethal entanglement. Increased thrust power requirements to overcome drag forces suggest that when entangled, whales require 3.95 × 109 to 4.08 × 1010 J more energy to swim. Individuals who died from their entanglements performed significantly more work (energy expenditure × time) than those that survived; entanglement duration is therefore critical in determining whales’ survival. Significant sublethal energetic impacts also occur, especially in reproductive females. Drag from fishing gear contributes up to 8% of the 4-year female reproductive energy budget, delaying time of energetic equilibrium (to restore energy lost by a particular entanglement) for reproduction by months to years. In certain populations, chronic entanglement in fishing gear can be viewed as a costly unnatural life-history stage, rather than a rare or short-term incident. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={In this work we would define an historical arrangement of the state of knowledge regarding the ecological impact of anthropogenic litter on marine mammals, assessing the role of different type of impacts (ingestion vs. entanglement) and pressures (three size-based categories). Analyzing 203 references (from 1976 to 2016), we obtained a “black-list” of 101 species impacted by marine litter (78.9% on 128 species totally known). At species level, four cetacean (Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus, Tursiops truncatus, Eubalaena glacialis) showed the highest number of bibliographic citations. A significant higher number of species was impacted by entanglement when compared to ingestion. Macro-litter represents the main factor of pressure in all groups; micro-litter showed the highest frequency in Mysticeti, probably explained from their food filtration behaviour. Both intrinsic eco-biogeographic traits (e.g. trophic niche, food catching behaviour, species range) and extrinsic methodological biases could explain our patterns. Since the entanglement is easier to record because of imply only an external observation without further post-mortem examination, and that large litter is easier to detect in respect to meso- and micro-litter, we hypothesize that both this information could be largely biased. Moreover, we observed a direct correlation between the research effort on species (obtained from Scholar recurrences) and the number of citations related to marine litter events, although some exceptions are present: therefore our “black” list of impacted species is not complete and could be increased focusing research on poor-studied neglected species. After 2005 the number of studies on this topic showed a large increase: however, literature appeared extremely heterogeneous. In this sense, we suggest the use of a standardized nomenclature for pressures and impacts to reduce the loss of information. © 2017, Associazione Teriologica Italiana onlus. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Baleen, an anisotropic oral filtering tissue found only in the mouth of mysticete whales and made solely of alpha-keratin, exhibitsmarkedly differing physical andmechanical properties between dried or (as in life) hydrated states. On average baleen is 32.35% water by weight in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 34.37% in bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). Baleen’s wettability measured by water droplet contact angles shows that dried baleen is hydrophobic whereas hydrated baleen is highly hydrophilic. Three-point flexural bending tests of mechanical strength reveal that baleen is strong yet ductile. Dried baleen is brittle and shatters at about 20-30 Nmm− 2 but hydrated baleen is less stiff; it bends with little force and absorbed water is squeezed outwhen force is applied. Maximum recorded stress was 4× higher in dried (mean 14.29 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 3.69 N mm− 2) baleen, and the flexural stiffness was &gt;10× higher in dried (mean 633 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 58 N mm− 2) baleen. In addition to documenting hydration’s powerful effects on baleen, this study indicates that baleen is far more pliant and malleable than commonly supposed, with implications for studies of baleen’s structure and function as well as its susceptibility to oil or other hydrophobic pollutants. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The classical understanding of mammalian vision is that it occurs through “duplex” retinae containing both rod and cone photoreceptors, the signals from which are processed through rod- and/or cone-specific signaling pathways. The recent discovery of rod monochromacy in some cetacean lineages provides a novel opportunity to investigate the effects of an evolutionary loss of cone photoreception on retinal organization. Sequence analysis of right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; family Balaenidae) cDNA derived from long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone opsin mRNA identified several mutations in the opsin coding sequence, suggesting the loss of cone cell function, but maintenance of non-photosensitive, cone opsin mRNA-expressing cells in the retina. Subsequently, we investigated the retina of the closely related bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus; family Balaenidae) to determine how the loss of cone-mediated photoreception affects light signaling pathways in the retina. Anti-opsin immunofluorescence demonstrated the total loss of cone opsin expression in B. mysticetus, whereas light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and bipolar cell (protein kinase C-α [PKC-α] and recoverin) immunofluorescence revealed the maintenance of cone soma, putative cone pedicles, and both rod and cone bipolar cell types. These findings represent the first immunological and anatomical evidence of a naturally occurring rod-monochromatic mammalian retina, and suggest that despite the loss of cone-mediated photoreception, the associated cone signaling structures (i.e., cone synapses and cone bipolar cells) may be maintained for multichannel rod-based signaling in balaenid whales.

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (NARW) (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the world's most threatened whales. It came close to extinction after nearly a millennium of exploitation and currently persists as a population of only approximately 500 individuals. Setting appropriate conservation targets for this species requires an understanding of its historical population size, as a baseline for measuring levels of depletion and progress toward recovery. This is made difficult by the scarcity of records over this species' long whaling history. We sought to estimate the preexploitation population size of the North Atlantic right whale and understand how this species was distributed across its range. We used a spatially explicit data set on historical catches of North Pacific right whales (NPRWs) (Eubalaena japonica) to model the relationship between right whale relative density and the environment during the summer feeding season. Assuming the 2 right whale species select similar environments, we projected this model to the North Atlantic to predict how the relative abundance of NARWs varied across their range. We calibrated these relative abundances with estimates of the NPRW total prewhaling population size to obtain high and low estimates for the overall NARW population size prior to exploitation. The model predicted 9,075-21,328 right whales in the North Atlantic. The current NARW population is thus <6% of the historical North Atlantic carrying capacity and has enormous potential for recovery. According to the model, in June-September NARWs concentrated in 2 main feeding areas: east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and in the Norwegian Sea. These 2 areas may become important in the future as feeding grounds and may already be used more regularly by this endangered species than is thought. © 2015 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Marine mammals have recently been documented as important facilitators of rapid and efficient nutrient recycling in coastal and offshore waters. Whales enhance phytoplankton nutrition by releasing fecal plumes near the surface after feeding and by migrating from highly productive, high-latitude feeding areas to low-latitude nutrient-poor calving areas. In this study, we measured NH4 + and PO4 3- release rates from the feces of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a highly endangered baleen whale. Samples for this species were primarily collected by locating aggregations of whales in surface- Active groups (SAGs), which typically consist of a central female surrounded by males competing for sexual activity. When freshly collected feces were incubated in seawater, high initial rates of N release were generally observed, which decreased to near zero within 24 hours of sampling, a pattern that is consistent with the active role of gut microflora on fecal particles. We estimate that at least 10% of particulate N in whale feces becomes available as NH4 + within 24 hours of defecation. Phosphorous was also abundant in fecal samples: Initial release rates of PO4 3- were higher than for NH4 +, yielding low N/P nutrient ratios over the course of our experiments. The rate of PO4 3- release was thus more than sufficient to preclude the possibility that nitrogenous nutrients supplied by whales would lead to phytoplankton production limited by P availability. Phytoplankton growth experiments indicated that NH4 + released from whale feces enhance productivity, as would be expected, with no evidence that fecal metabolites suppress growth. Although North Atlantic right whales are currently rare (approximately 450 individuals), they once numbered about 14,000 and likely played a substantial role in recycling nutrients in areas where they gathered to feed and mate. Even though the NH4 + released from fresh whale fecal material is a small fraction of total whale fecal nitrogen, and recognizing the fact that the additional nitrogen released in whale urine would be difficult to measure in a field study, the results of this study support the idea that the distinctive isotopic signature of the released NH4 + could be used to provide a conservative estimate of the contribution of the whale pump to primary productivity in coastal regions where whales congregate. © 2016 Roman et al.

abstract={Lethal and sublethal fishing gear entanglement is pervasive in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). Entanglement can lead to direct injury and is likely to incur substantial energetic costs. This study (1) evaluates drag characteristics of entangled right whales, (2) contextualizes gear drag measurements for individual whales, and (3) quantifies the benefits of partial disentanglement. A load cell measured drag forces on 15 sets of fishing gear removed from entangled right whales, a towed satellite telemetry buoy, and 200 m of polypropylene line as it was shortened to 25 m, as they were towed behind a vessel at ~0.77, 1.3, and 2.1 m/s (~1.5, 2.5, and 4 knots) and ~0, 3, and 6 m depth. Mean drag ranges from 8.5 N to 315 N, and can be predicted from the dry weight or length of the gear. Combining gear drag measurements with theoretical estimates of drag on whales' bodies suggests that on average, entanglement increases drag and propulsive power by 1.47 fold. Reducing trailing line length by 75% can reduce parasitic gear drag by 85%, reinforcing current disentanglement response practices. These drag measurements can be incorporated into disentanglement response, serious injury determination, and evaluation of sublethal effects on population dynamics. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Entanglement in fixed fishing gear affects whales worldwide. In the United States, deaths of North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have exceeded management limits for decades. We examined live and dead whales entangled in fishing gear along the U.S. East Coast and the Canadian Maritimes from 1994 to 2010. We recorded whale species, age, and injury severity and determined rope polymer type, breaking strength, and diameter of the fishing gear. For the 132 retrieved ropes from 70 cases, tested breaking strength range was 0.80-39.63 kN (kiloNewtons) and the mean was 11.64 kN (SD 8.29), which is 26% lower than strength at manufacture (range 2.89-53.38 kN, mean = 15.70 kN [9.89]). Median rope diameter was 9.5 mm. Right and humpback whales were found in ropes with significantly stronger breaking strengths at time of manufacture than minke whales (Balaenoptera acuturostrata) (19.30, 17.13, and 10.47 mean kN, respectively). Adult right whales were found in stronger ropes (mean 34.09 kN) than juvenile right whales (mean 15.33 kN) and than all humpback whale age classes (mean 17.37 kN). For right whales, severity of injuries increased since the mid 1980s, possibly due to changes in rope manufacturing in the mid 1990s that resulted in production of stronger ropes at the same diameter. Our results suggest that broad adoption of ropes with breaking strengths of ≤7.56 kN (≤1700 lbsf) could reduce the number of life-threatening entanglements for large whales by at least 72%, and yet could provide sufficient strength to withstand the routine forces involved in many fishing operations. A reduction of this magnitude would achieve nearly all the mitigation legally required for U.S. stocks of North Atlantic right and humpback whales. Ropes with reduced breaking strength should be developed and tested to determine the feasibility of their use in a variety of fisheries. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={The endangered North Atlantic right whale is susceptible to increased risks associated with the developing energy market off the Virginia coast of the U.S.A., including increased noise exposure from shipping and energy exploration and extraction, and shipping activity. Primarily viewed as a migratory corridor between northern feeding and mating areas and the southern calving area, Virginia waters have not been intensely monitored for right whales. We conducted a 1 yr, continuous, passive acoustic survey from the Virginia coast to the continental shelf to better describe the seasonal occurrence and spatial distribution of right whales in this area. We found that whales were acoustically detected in every month of the year, with increased seasonal occurrences in fall and late winter/early spring, and not just during limited periods of the year. As industry activities continue to increase in the area, these new right whale occurrence data have implications for siting and permitting of offshore energy activities. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Expert elicitation is a rigorous method for synthesizing expert knowledge to inform decision making and is reliable and practical when field data are limited. We evaluated the feasibility of applying expert elicitation to estimate populationlevel effects of disturbance on marine mammals. Diverse experts estimated parameters related to mortality and sublethal injury of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). We are now eliciting expert knowledge on the movement of right whales among geographic regions to parameterize a spatial model of health. Expert elicitation complements methods such as simulation models or extrapolations from other species, sometimes with greater accuracy and less uncertainty. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Right whales are vulnerable to many sources of anthropogenic disturbance including ship strikes, entanglement with fishing gear, and anthropogenic noise. The effect of these factors on individual health is unclear. A statistical model using photographic evidence of health was recently built to infer the true or hidden health of individual right whales. However, two important prior assumptions about the role of missing data and unexplained variance on the estimates were not previously assessed. Here we tested these factors by varying prior assumptions and model formulation. We found sensitivity to each assumption and used the output to make guidelines on future model formulation. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool that allows remote detection of marine mammals through their vocalizations. While call detection provides information on species presence, additional information may be contained within the vocalizations that could provide more information regarding the demographics and/or number of individuals in a particular area based on passive acoustic detections. The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis produces a stereotyped upswept call, termed the upcall, that is thought to function as a long-distance contact call in this species. As such, the call is likely to contain cues providing information about the individual producing it. The goal of this study was to test whether the right whale upcall could potentially encode information related to the identity and age of the caller. Using upcalls recorded from 14 known individuals through non-invasive suction cup archival acoustic tags, we demonstrate that the upcall does contain sufficient information to discriminate individual identity and age class, with average classification levels of 72.6 and 86.1%, respectively. Parameters measured from the fundamental frequency, duration, and formant structure were most important for discrimination among individuals. This study is the first step in demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining additional data from passive acoustic monitoring to aid in the conservation efforts for this highly endangered species. ï¿½ The authors 2016.},

abstract={Passive acoustic data collected from marine autonomous recording units deployed off Jacksonville, FL(from 13 September to 8 October 2009 and 3 December 2009 to 8 January 2010), were analyzed for detection of cetaceans and Navy sonar. Cetaceans detected included Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Eubalaena glacialis, B. borealis, Physeter macrocephalus, blackfish, and delphinids. E. glacialis were detected at shallow and, somewhat unexpectedly, deep sites. P. macrocephalus were characterized by a strong diel pattern. B. acutorostrata showed the strongest relationship between sonar activity and vocal behavior. These results provide a preliminary assessment of cetacean occurrence off Jacksonville and new insights on vocal responses to sonar. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Marine mammals are faced with increasing challenges from environmental fluctuation, climate change, and disturbances from human activities. Anthropogenic mortalities have been well documented, but it is difficult to assess the sub-lethal effects of disturbance on the fitness of marine wildlife, and to distinguish these impacts from natural variations in health and reproduction. Here, we used photographic data on body and skin condition, blowhole cyamids, and rake marks, to evaluate the health of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis from 1980 to 2008. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to these data to estimate the underlying continuous health status of individuals, demographic groups, and the population to characterize health patterns and temporal trends. Visual health scores (scaled from 0 to 100) from 48560 sighting events were used to estimate the health of 622 identified right whales on a monthly basis. Health in most whales fluctuated between 70 and 90, and health scores of <60 were observed in whales in poor condition. Health varied by sex, age-class and reproductive state, with the greatest annual variability occurring in actively reproducing females. Calving females had significantly higher health scores than non-calving females, and a steep deterioration in population health coincided with a dramatic decline in calving from 1998 to 2000. Health in all demographic groups and the population declined over the 3 decades of observations. Given the inevitable data gaps that occur in most marine wildlife research, modeling advances such as the one presented here offer a promising approach to assess the complex interactions between biology, ecology, and sublethal anthropogenic disturbance on marine mammals. © 2016 Inter-Research.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis are among the most endangered of the large whales. Although protected since 1935, their abundance has remained low. Right whales occupy the Atlantic Ocean from southern Greenland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence south to Florida. The highly industrialized mid-Atlantic region is part of the right whales' migratory corridor, and gaps in knowledge of their movements through this region have limited the ability to make informed decisions about management of the species. To help fill these gaps, we elicited estimates of the relative abundance of adult right whales in the mid-Atlantic during 4 months (each month representing each season) from 10 experts on right whale ecology and management. We elicited the minimum, maximum, and mode as the number of individuals in a hypothetical population of 100 right whales, and confidence estimates as percentages. For each month-sex combination, we merged the 10 experts' answers into 1 distribution. The estimated modes of relative abundances of both sexes were highest in January and April (females: 29 and 59; males: 22 and 23) and lowest in July and October (females: 5 and 9; males: 3 and 5). In some cases, our elicitation results were consistent with the results of studies based on sightings data. However, these studies generally did not adjust for sampling effort, which was low and likely variable. Our results supplement the results of these studies and will increase the accuracy of priors in complementary Bayesian models of right whale abundances and movements through the mid-Atlantic.},

abstract={Sound from transoceanic shipping is a major component of ocean noise budgets. Baleen whale communication may be particularly vulnerable to shipping noise impacts due to overlap in the frequencies of signals and noise. Baleen whales rely upon acoustic signals to mediate a variety of social interactions when separated beyond visual range. We investigated the potential for noise to interfere with critical reunion events between mother-calf pairs of Endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, and whether vocal compensation can improve or maintain communication space between the sender and receiver. This information is necessary to inform future conservation efforts. We used acoustic propagation modeling to predict the transmission loss of the primary tonal communication signal used during mother-calf communication, the 'upcall', to (1) estimate over what ranges a receiving whale can detect a signal in anthropogenic noise, and (2) determine the effects of vocal compensation on detection range. Our results indicate that both point-source noise from nearby container ships and increased background noise from distant shipping may significantly limit communication space. Additionally, we show how amplitude and frequency compensation can increase the likelihood of detecting communication signals in masking noise under present conditions. We discuss these impacts of ship noise on communication, as well as the evidence that documented noise compensation behaviors of right whales can improve communication range in the presence of low-frequency ship noise. © The authors 2016.},

abstract={Reproduction of mysticete whales is difficult to monitor, and basic parameters, such as pregnancy rate and inter-calving interval, remain unknown for many populations. We hypothesized that baleen plates (keratinous strips that grow downward from the palate of mysticete whales) might record previous pregnancies, in the form of high-progesterone regions in the sections of baleen that grew while the whale was pregnant. To test this hypothesis, longitudinal baleen progesterone profiles from two adult female North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) that died as a result of ship strike were compared with dates of known pregnancies inferred from calf sightings and post-mortem data. We sampled a full-length baleen plate from each female at 4 cm intervals from base (newest baleen) to tip (oldest baleen), each interval representing ~60 days of baleen growth, with high-progesterone areas then sampled at 2 or 1 cm intervals. Pulverized baleen powder was assayed for progesterone using enzyme immunoassay. The date of growth of each sampling location on the baleen plate was estimated based on the distance from the base of the plate and baleen growth rates derived from annual cycles of stable isotope ratios. Baleen progesterone profiles from both whales showed dramatic elevations (two orders of magnitude higher than baseline) in areas corresponding to known pregnancies. Baleen hormone analysis shows great potential for estimation of recent reproductive history, inter-calving interval and general reproductive biology in this species and, possibly, in other mysticete whales. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Measures established to protect living marine resources, including those for endangered marine species, are only infrequently evaluated. In this paper we report findings of an online survey designed to solicit the views of maritime industries about a long-standing endangered large whale conservation program: the Mandatory Ship Reporting (MSR) system. The MSR was established in 1999 to aid in reducing the threat of vessel collisions with the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis. Under MSR provisions, vessels >300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination when entering two key right whale aggregation areas. In return, reporting ships are sent an automated message about right whale vulnerability to ship collisions. The survey was intended to obtain views about the extent to which vessel operations were interrupted by opinthe reporting requirement; how mariners utilize, if at all, information provided in the return message; whether vessel operations were modified in response to guidance provided; and the overall importance and effectiveness of the reporting systems in helping ships avoid right whale interactions. A total of 119 mariners with broad representation of vessel types and decades of experience at sea took part in the survey; 56 of these indicated they had entered one of the MSR areas at least once. Most (ca. 70%) indicated that they comply with the reporting requirement, distribute information on right whales and ship strikes to crew members, that they were more alert about avoiding/watching for right whales, and that the ships operation may change to avoid an interaction. Of the survey-takers who had entered the system, about half indicated the MSR system is useful for educat educating captains and crew about right whales and important for right whale conservation, but only about a quarter indicated that it is useful in helping ships avoid right whales. About 40% said it is an unnecessary requirement for ships. We conclude that as an outreach tool and a means to provide information directly to domestic and international mariners entering right whale habitat for over 15 years (thus, tens of thousands of ships entering these waters have received the message), the MSR almost certainly has been beneficial in educating mariners about the issue of ship strike and in providing guidance on avoiding ship strikes. Views refl ected in the survey suggest that, at least from the mariners' perspective, the MSR program has provided positive conservation value; however, not all mariners took specific strike avoidance action after having received the message.},

abstract={Time–area closures have been widely used in fisheries management to prevent overfishing and reduce the bycatch of protected species. Due to quota overages and concerns about entanglement of federally protected North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, the commercial harvest of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata using pot gear has been prohibited in the southeastern United States in winter since 2009. Following the rebuilding of the Black Sea Bass stock and a change to the start date of the fishing year, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) increased the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) and is considering twelve alternatives to the pot gear closure that would revise the timing and/or spatial extent of the closure. Changes to this closure could affect the annual catch of Black Sea Bass and increase the risk of right whale entanglement in pot gear. Using historical fishing effort, landings, and right whale sightings data, we projected Black Sea Bass landings and the relative risk of right whale entanglement for each closure alternative, expressed in relative risk units (RRU). We predict that the ACL would be caught, resulting in an in-season closure for most of the proposed SAFMC closure alternatives. The relative risk of entanglement, estimated from the spatial and temporal overlap of Black Sea Bass pot gear fishing effort and right whale relative abundance, was lower for some alternatives than for others, and the relative differences between alternatives were consistent among uncertainty scenarios. The SAFMC’s preferred alternative is projected to result in a relatively low increase in risk to North Atlantic right whales (3–15 RRU off North Carolina and 1–12 RRU off Florida–South Carolina). This framework demonstrates the use of temporally dynamic spatial overlays in assessing the impacts of time–area closures with multiple objectives. © Nicholas A. Farmer, Timothy A. Gowan, Jessica R.

abstract={Speed regulations of watercraft in protected areas are designed to reduce lethal collisions with wildlife but can have economic consequences. We present a quantitative framework for investigating the risk of deadly collisions between boats and wildlife. We apply encounter rate theory to demonstrate how marine mammal-boat encounter rate can be used to predict the expected number of deaths associated with management scenarios. We illustrate our approach with management scenarios for two endangered species: the Florida manatee Trichechus manatus latirostris and the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. We used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to demonstrate the uncertainty that is associated with our estimate of relative mortality. We show that encounter rate increased with vessel speed but that the expected number of encounters varies depending on the boating activities considered. For instance, in a scenario involving manatees and boating activities such as water skiing, the expected number of encounters in a given area (in a fixed time interval) increased with vessel speed. In another scenario in which a vessel made a transit of fixed length, the expected number of encounters decreases slightly with boat speed. In both cases, the expected number of encounters increased with distanced travelled by the boat. For whales, we found a slight reduction (0·1%) in the number of encounters under a scenario where speed is unregulated; this reduction, however, is negligible, and overall expected relative mortality was ~30% lower under the scenario with speed regulation. The probability of avoidance by the animal or vessel was set to 0 because of lack of data, but we explored the importance of this parameter on the model predictions. In fact, expected relative mortality under speed regulations decreases even further when the probability of avoidance is a decreasing function of vessel speed. By applying encounter rate theory to the case of boat collisions with marine mammals, we gained new insights about encounter processes between wildlife and watercraft. Our work emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainty when estimating wildlife mortality.

abstract={The impacts of human activities on cryptic marine species can be difficult to assess. The North Atlantic right whale is an endangered species numbering just over 500 individuals. Entanglement in fishing gear is one documented source of injury and mortality, but population-level effects have been difficult to quantify. We used documented entanglements, long-term population studies and mark-recapture statistical techniques to evaluate the effect of these events on North Atlantic right whale survival. Estimates were based on 50 individuals observed carrying entangling gear between 1995 and 2008, and compared to 459 others that were never observed with gear during the same period. Entangled adults had low initial apparent survival (0.749, 95% CI: 0.601-0.855), but those that survived the first year achieved a survival rate (0.952, 95% CI: 0.907-0.977) that was more comparable to unaffected adult females (0.961, 95% CI: 0.941-0.974) and males (0.986, 95% CI: 0.975-0.993). Juveniles had a post-entanglement survival rate that was comparable to the initial survival of entangled adults (0.733, 95% CI: 0.532-0.869) and lower than un-impacted juveniles (0.978, 95% CI: 0.969-0.985). Of three entanglement characteristics examined, health impacts were most predictive of subsequent survival, but the entanglement configuration and the resulting injuries also appeared to affect outcome. When the entanglement configuration was assessed as high risk, human intervention (disentanglement) improved the survival outcome. This is the first mark-recapture estimate of entanglement survival for any whale species. The results indicate the need for continued mitigation efforts for this species, as well as for a better understanding of entanglement impacts in other baleen whale populations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Roseway and Grand Manan basins on the Canadian Atlantic coast are neighboring late-summer critical feeding habitats for endangered North Atlantic right whales. Although in late summer these habitats regularly contain thick aggregations of right whale food - the copepod Calanus spp. - right whales periodically abandon one or both habitats in the same year. The causes of abandonments, their relationship to food supply, and the locations of whales during abandonment periods are unclear. The goals of this study were to explain variation in right whale abundance indices from a habitat perspective, and to determine whether or not oceanographic variation in the habitats influences occupancy. Four indices of whale abundance and habitat occupancy, including sightings per unit effort (SPUE), photographic sightings of known individuals, population size and habitat transition probabilities, were analyzed in relation to unique datasets of Calanus concentration and water mass characteristics in each basin over the period 1987 through 2009. Calanus concentration, water mass sources and various hydrographic properties each varied coherently between basins. Calanus concentration showed an increasing trend over time in each habitat, although a short-lived reduction in Calanus may have caused right whales to abandon Roseway Basin during the mid-1990s. Food supply explained variation in right whale sightings and population size in Roseway Basin, but not in Grand Manan Basin, suggesting that the Grand Manan Basin has important habitat characteristics in addition to food supply. Changes in the distribution of whale abundance indices during years when oceanographic conditions were associated with reduced food supply in the Scotia-Fundy region suggest that other suitable feeding habitats may not have existed during such years and resulted in negative effects on whale health and reproduction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Considered one of the most endangered cetacean species, the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis suffered declining abundance during the 1990s due to a high rate of anthropogenic-associated mortality and a low rate of reproduction. Previous studies have suggested that the reproductive rate is tightly coupled to the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), which has been shown to respond to ecosystem regime shifts associated with decadal-scale climate forcing from the Arctic. Given the endangered status of the right whale population, it is vital to determine how climate-associated changes in prey availability will affect this species in the future. Here, we investigate a 3-state reproduction model that explores multiple environmental proxies as potential predictors of annual calf production during the period from 980 to 2007. The model achieves its best fit to observations using temporally and spatially resolved C. finmarchicus abundance data derived from Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) surveys of the GOM. Building on previous research, this prey-dependent model, which uses bimonthly and geographically specific abundance anomalies of C. finmarchicus, significantly improves estimates of annual calf production relative to a null model. The temporal and geographic distributions of prey objectively chosen for inclusion in the new version of the model correspond well with observed right whale seasonal distribution patterns, providing further evidence that the model captures essential features of right whale reproductive ecology. © Inter-Research 2015.},

abstract={Marine debris is listed among the major perceived threats to biodiversity, and is cause for particular concern due to its abundance, durability and persistence in the marine environment. An extensive literature search reviewed the current state of knowledge on the effects of marine debris on marine organisms. 340 original publications reported encounters between organisms and marine debris and 693 species. Plastic debris accounted for 92% of encounters between debris and individuals. Numerous direct and indirect consequences were recorded, with the potential for sublethal effects of ingestion an area of considerable uncertainty and concern. Comparison to the IUCN Red List highlighted that at least 17% of species affected by entanglement and ingestion were listed as threatened or near threatened. Hence where marine debris combines with other anthropogenic stressors it may affect populations, trophic interactions and assemblages. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Whales receive underwater sounds through a fundamentally different mechanism than their close terrestrial relatives. Instead of hearing through the ear canal, cetaceans hear through specialized fatty tissues leading to an evolutionarily novel feature: an acoustic funnel located anterior to the tympanic aperture. We traced the ontogenetic development of this feature in 56 fetal specimens from 10 different families of toothed (odontocete) and baleen (mysticete) whales, using X-ray computed tomography. We also charted ear ossification patterns through ontogeny to understand the impact of heterochronic developmental processes. We determined that the acoustic funnel arises from a prominent V-shaped structure established early in ontogeny, formed by the malleus and the goniale. In odontocetes, this V-formation develops into a cone-shaped funnel facing anteriorly, directly into intramandibular acoustic fats, which is likely functionally linked to the anterior orientation of sound reception in echolocation. In contrast, the acoustic funnel in balaenopterids rotates laterally, later in fetal development, consistent with a lateral sound reception pathway. Balaenids and several fossil mysticetes retain a somewhat anteriorly oriented acoustic funnel in the mature condition, indicating that a lateral sound reception pathway in balaenopterids may be a recent evolutionary innovation linked to specialized feeding modes, such as lunge-feeding.},

abstract={The central Gulf of Maine was recently identified as a persistent wintering ground and potential mating ground for non-calving North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis based on aerial survey data. However, these surveys were limited by bad weather and light. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the long-term persistence of right whales in this area throughout a nearly continuous period from October 2009 through October 2010. Three archival marine acoustic recording units were deployed in the Outer Fall/central Gulf of Maine. The data were manually reviewed for right whale up-calls and gunshots to investigate seasonal and diel patterns. Up-calls and gunshots occurred seasonally, with the most calls recorded from October through January and fewer calls detected from February through July, increasing again in August through October. Up-calls were most frequent in November, and gunshots in December. There was a clear bimodal diel pattern in up-calls, with the majority of calls occurring between 04:00 through 08:00 h and 13:00 through 22:00 h. There was a clear peak in diel distribution of gunshots, with the majority of calls occurring between 16:00 and 22:00 h. Our data demonstrate the continuous presence of right whales in the central Gulf of Maine during the winter months. The rate of gunshots during winter months in Outer Fall supports the hypothesis that male advertisement and/or right whale mating behavior may be taking place in this region at that time. © Bort, Stevick, Summers and Todd 2015.},

abstract={Aim: To obtain a plausible hypothesis for the historical distribution of North Atlantic right whales (NARWs) (Eubalaena glacialis) in their summer feeding grounds. Previously widespread in the North Atlantic, after centuries of hunting, these whales survive as a small population off eastern North America. Because their exploitation began before formal records started, information about their historical distribution is fragmentary. Location: North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. Methods: We linked historical records of North Pacific right whales (E. japonica; from 19th-century American whaling logbooks) with oceanographic data to generate a species distribution model. Assuming that the two species have similar environmental preferences, the model was projected into the North Atlantic to predict environmental suitability for NARWs. The reliability of these predictions was assessed by comparing the model results with historical and recent records in the North Atlantic. Results: The model predicts suitable environmental conditions over a wide, mostly offshore band across the North Atlantic. Predictions are well supported by historical and recent records, but discrepancies in some areas indicate lower discriminative ability in coastal, shallow-depth areas, suggesting that this model mainly describes the summer offshore distribution of right whales. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the summer range of the NARW consisted of a relatively narrow band (width c. 10° in latitude), extending from the eastern coast of North America to northern Norway, over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, south of Greenland and Iceland, north of the British Isles and in the Norwegian Sea. These results highlight possibilities for additional research both on the history of exploitation and on the current summer distribution of this species. In particular, better survey coverage of historical whaling grounds could help inform conservation efforts for this endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates the challenges and opportunities in using historical data to understand the original distribution of highly depleted species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (NARW), a critically endangered species that has been under intensive study for nearly four decades, provides an excellent case study for applying modern methods of conservation physiology to large whales. By combining long-term sighting histories of known individuals with physiological data from newer techniques (e.g., body condition estimated from photographs; endocrine status derived from fecal samples), physiological state and levels of stress can be estimated despite the lack of any method for nonlethal capture of large whales. Since traditional techniques for validating blood assays cannot be used in large whales, assays of fecal hormones have been validated using information on age, sex, and reproductive state derived from an extensive NARW photo-identification catalog. Using this approach, fecal glucocorticoids have been found to vary dramatically with reproductive state. It is therefore essential that glucocorticoid data be interpreted in conjunction with reproductive data. A case study correlating glucocorticoids with chronic noise is presented as an example. Keys to a successful research program for this uncatchable species have included: consistent population monitoring over decades, data-sharing across institutions, an extensive photo-identification catalog that documents individual histories, and consistent efforts at noninvasive collection of samples over years. Future research will require flexibility to adjust to changing distributions of populations. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Marine mammal abundance and distribution in New Jersey's nearshore waters are not well known due to limited dedicated studies. The first yearround systematic surveys were conducted to determine the spatial/temporal distribution and estimate the abundance of marine mammals in this region prior to wind power development. Eight marine mammal species were observed: North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). Results indicate clear seasonal patterns in distribution and abundance. The fin whale, humpback whale and bottlenose dolphin were sighted during all seasons. The abundance of large whales in the study area was relatively low while the abundance of dolphin and porpoise species was high and largely seasonal. The bottlenose dolphin was the most abundant species; however, abundance was high only during spring and summer. Common dolphins and harbour porpoises were common in the study area during winter and spring. These baseline data will be used to assess potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of offshore wind power facilities in this region.},

abstract={The distribution and seasonal patterns of the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, inform management decisions that mitigate anthropogenic threats. Based on data from visual surveys, much of the population migrates between winter calving grounds in coastal waters adjacent to the southeast USA and summer feeding and nursery grounds adjacent to the northeast USA. However, little is known about right whale occurrence along the mid-Atlantic US migratory corridor. A better understanding of right whale occurrence in this region is needed prior to offshore wind energy development activities, which may increase mortality risks and chronic impacts on the population. We conducted an 11 mo passive acoustic survey along coastal North Carolina and Georgia near several wind energy areas to document the acoustic occurrence of right whales in the southern region of the mid-Atlantic US coast. Right whales were acoustically detected across all seasons, with peak seasonal presence occurring during autumn in the Georgia site and during winter in the North Carolina site. A secondary peak in presence also occurred during June and July in the Georgia site, when right whales were not expected to be in the area. Given the nearly year-round presence of right whales in the survey areas, these results may warrant an evaluation of current management protocols in order to provide adequate protection to the population in the face of offshore energy development activities. © The authors 2015.},

abstract={In 1998, the United States sought and received InternationalMaritime Organizationendorsement of twoMandatory Ship Reporting (MSR) systems designed to improve mariner awareness about averting ship collisions with the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Vessel collisions are a serious threat to the right whale and the program was among the first formal attempts to reduce this threat. Under the provisions of the MSR, all ships >300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination to a shore-based station when entering two key right whale habitats: one in waters off New England and one off coastal Georgia and Florida. In return, reporting ships receive an automatically-generated message, delivered directly to the ship's bridge, that provides information about right whale vulnerability to vessel collisions and actions mariners can take to avoid collisions. The MSR has been in operation continuously fromJuly 1999 to the present. Archived incoming reports provided a 15-plus year history of ship operations in these two locations. We analyzed a total of 26,772 incoming MSR messages logged between July 1999 and December 2013. Most ships that were required to report did so, and compliance rates were generally constant throughout the study period. Self-reported vessel speeds when entering the systems indicated that most ships travelled between 10 and 16 (range = 5-20+) knots. Ship speeds generally decreased in 2009 to 2013 following implementation of vessel speed restrictions. The number of reports into the southern systemremained relatively constant following a steady increase through 2007, but numbers in the northern system decreased annually beginning in 2008. If reporting is indicative of long-term patterns in shipping operations, it reflects noteworthy changes in marine transportation. Observed declines in ship traffic are likely attributable to the 2008-2009 economic recession, the containerized shipping industry making increased use of larger ships that made fewer trips, and diminished oil/gas US imports as previously inaccessible domestic deposits were exploited. Recent declines in shipping activity likely resulted in lowered collision risks for right whales and reduced their exposure to underwater noise fromships. © 2015 Silber et al.},

abstract={To determine effectiveness of Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs), introduced in 2008 on the U.S. East Coast to reduce lethal vessel strikes to North Atlantic right whales, we analyzed observed large whale mortality events from 1990-2012 in the geographic region of the "Ship Strike Rule" to identify changes in frequency, spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal interaction since implementation. Though not directly coincident with SMA implementation, right whale vessel-strike mortalities significantly declined from 2.0 (2000-2006) to 0.33 per year (2007-2012). Large whale vessel-strike mortalities have decreased inside active SMAs, and increased outside inactive SMAs. We detected no significant spatiotemporal interaction in the 4-year pre- or post-Rule periods, although a longer time series is needed to detect these changes. As designed, SMAs encompass only 36% of historical right whale vessel-strike mortalities, and 32% are outside managed space but within managed timeframes. We suggest increasing spatial coverage to improve the Rule's effectiveness. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={In this review, we merge existing published and unpublished information along with expert judg-ment to identify and support the delineation of 18 Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) in U.S. waters along the East Coast for minke whales, sei whales, fin whales, North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, harbor porpoises, and bottle-nose dolphins. BIAs are delineated for feeding areas, reproductive areas, migratory corridors, and small and resident populations to enhance existing information already available to scientists, man-agers, policymakers, and the public. BIAs ranged in size from approximately 152 to 270,000 km2. They are intended to provide synthesized infor-mation in a transparent format that can be readily used toward the analyses and planning under U.S. statutes that require the characterization and mini-mization of impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine mammals. BIAs are not intended to repre-sent all important areas for consideration in plan-ning processes; in particular, areas of high marine mammal density, typically identified based on a combination of systematic visual and/or acoustic detections coupled with quantitative modeling, are very important to consider, where available, in any assessment. To maintain their utility, East Coast BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.},

abstract={General movement patterns for North Atlantic right whales are known, but quantitative season-specific estimates of individual movements and the resultant distributions do not exist. We use a Brownian Bridge movement model to estimate individual movement patterns and spatial probability distributions using time- and location-specific photo-identified right whales from 1978 through 2007 to produce monthly estimates of movement and distribution patterns for the population in the NW Atlantic, from Cape Cod northward. For comparative purposes we also estimate right whale transition probabilities among ocean regions to estimate rates of emigration and immigration, likely destinations, and monthly regionally specific population estimates. Areas were identified that right whales may frequent and that are potential locations of the regularly unaccounted proportion of the population. These areas, requiring additional survey effort, include the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf, Columbia Ledges and western Jordan Basin. Our results show that along the northeast Atlantic coasts of Canada and the USA, right whales annually migrate in a general counter-clockwise pattern; north and east along the continental shelf in the spring and summer, and south and west along the coast during autumn and winter. The results also provide quantitative spatio-temporal estimates of right whales for all regions, including those that are rarely or never surveyed. The spatial probability distributions that we provide can be used in the future to quantitatively evaluate risks to right whales from human activities, particularly vessel traffic and commercial fishing, and thereby increase our ability to manage the risks and improve right whale conservation. © The authors 2015.},

abstract={Statistical characteristics of signal trains produced by North Atlantic right whales (NARW) during the winter and early spring in Cape Cod Bay, MA are described. Data analysis was based on four days of acoustic recordings that were obtained with synchronized hydrophones. Based on temporal and geographical clustering of detected signals, 7264 NARW sounds were identified and associated with 559 signal trains. The detected signals were assigned to four classes of narrowband tonal calls - upcalls, downcalls, complex, and high frequency, and two classes of wideband sounds - gunshots and complex. Empirical distributions of the number of signals in trains, total duration of trains, the positions of NARW, and signal classes are presented. Results indicate that 68.9% of all signal trains consisted of 10 or fewer signals. Low and high frequency tonals that lacked wideband sounds formed 69.1% of trains; 5.0% of trains lacked tonals. Trains consisting of only upcalls comprised 44.2% of all detected trains. Because 18.3% of trains contained no upcalls, using detectors that identify all signal classes would improve right whale detection. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales have one of the lowest levels of genetic variation at minisatellite loci, microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial control region haplotypes among mammals. Here, adaptive variation at the peptide binding region of class I and class II DRB-like genes of the major histocompatibility complex was assessed. Amplification of a duplicated region in 222 individuals revealed at least 11 class II alleles. Six alleles were assigned to the locus Eugl-DRB1 and 5 alleles were assigned to the locus Eugl-DRB2 by assessing segregation patterns of alleles from 81 parent/offspring pedigrees. Pedigree analysis indicated that these alleles segregated into 12 distinct haplotypes. Genotyping a smaller subset of unrelated individuals (n = 5 and 10, respectively) using different primer sets revealed at least 2 class II pseudogenes (with ≥ 4 alleles) and at least 3 class I loci (with ≥ 6 alleles). Class II sequences were significantly different from neutrality at peptide binding sites suggesting loci may be under the influence of balancing selection. Trans-species sharing of alleles was apparent for class I and class II sequences. Characterization of class II loci represents the first step in determining the relationship between major histocompatibility complex variability and factors affecting health and reproduction in this species. © The American Genetic Association 2013.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) faces increasing pressure from commercial shipping traffic and proposed marine renewable energy developments. Drawing upon the successful Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary model, we propose a multi-stakeholder marine spatial planning process that considers both appropriate positioning of offshore wind farms and redefining commercial shipping lanes relative to whale migration routes: placement of wind turbines within certain right whale habitats may prove beneficial for the species. To that end, it may be advisable to initially relocate the shipping lanes for the benefit of the whales prior to selecting wind energy areas. The optimal end-state is the commercial viability of renewable energy, as well as a safe shipping infrastructure, with minimal risk of collision and exposure to shipping noise for the whales.

abstract={The coastal waters off the southeastern United States (SEUS) are a primary wintering ground for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), used by calving females along with other adult and juvenile whales. Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22uC SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. © 2014 Lihong et al.},

abstract={The coastal waters off the southeastern United States (SEUS) are a primary wintering ground for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), used by calving females along with other adult and juvenile whales. Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22°C SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. Copyright © 2014 Gowan, Ortega-Ortiz.

abstract={Remote acoustic monitoring is a non-invasive tool that can be used to study the distribution, behavior, and habitat use of sound-producing species. The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is an endangered baleen whale species that produces a variety of stereotyped acoustic signals. One of these signals, the "gunshot" sound, has only been recorded from adult male North Atlantic right whales and is thought to function for reproduction, either as reproductive advertisement for females or as an agonistic signal toward other males. This study uses remote acoustic monitoring to analyze the presence of gunshots over a two-year period at two sites on the Scotian Shelf to determine if there is evidence that North Atlantic right whales may use these locations for breeding activities. Seasonal analyses at both locations indicate that gunshot sound production is highly seasonal, with an increase in the autumn. One site, Roseway West, had significantly more gunshot sounds overall and exhibited a clear diel trend in production of these signals at night. The other site, Emerald South, also showed a seasonal increase in gunshot production during the autumn, but did not show any significant diel trend. This difference in gunshot signal production at the two sites indicates variation either in the number or the behavior of whales at each location. The timing of the observed seasonal increase in gunshot sound production is consistent with the current understanding of the right whale breeding season, and our results demonstrate that detection of gunshots with remote acoustic monitoring can be a reliable way to track shifts in distribution and changes in acoustic behavior including possible mating activities. © 2014 Matthews et al.},

abstract={Knowledge about the level of public attention toward different species is crucial to successful conservation. The evolution of online social networks offers new possibilities for collecting data about public interest. Building on an analysis of text messages on Twitter, this study aimed to quantify the level of public attention toward different mammal and bird species listed (at the full species or subspecies/population level) under the United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA). Once a month during 1 year, I searched recently posted messages ('tweets') for the common names of every listed species. The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) was by far the most tweeted species. The other most tweeted mammals were the American bison (Bison bison), brown bear (U. arctos), cougar (Puma concolor), killer whale (Orcinus orca), black bear (U. americanus) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), respectively. The three most frequently tweeted birds were the sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), whooping crane (G. americana) and spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Some species, such as the manatee, right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) ranked higher when restricting the search to conservation contexts. The results suggest that Twitter users interact about a biased sample of ESA-listed species: mammals were better represented than birds among the most tweeted species and larger-sized species received more tweets. The findings can be used for prioritizing conservation education and marketing campaigns aiming to raise the profile of lesser-known listed species. Data from online social networks open the door for a range of novel applications in conservation science. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The former occurrence of the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis on the Portuguese coast may be inferred from the historical range of that species in Europe and in NW Africa. It is generally accepted that it was the main prey of coastal whaling in the Middle Ages and in the pre-modern period, but this assumption still needs firming up based on biological and archaeological evidence. We describe the skeletal remains of right whales excavated at Peniche in 2001-2002, in association with archaeological artefacts. The whale bones were covered by sandy sediments on the old seashore and they have been tentatively dated around the 16th to 17th centuries. This study contributes material evidence to the former occurrence of E. glacialis in Portugal (West Iberia). Some whale bones show unequivocal man-made scars. These are associated to wounds from instruments with a sharp-cutting blade. This evidence for past human interaction may suggest that whaling for that species was active at Peniche around the early 17th century. © 2014 Teixeira et al.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis aggregate in Roseway Basin on the western Scotian Shelf where their energy-rich food sources, diapausing copepods Calanus spp., are concentrated at depth. The Canadian Species at Risk Recovery Strategy for right whales provides provisional Critical Habitat (CH) boundaries for Roseway Basin based on right whale occupancy, with the stipulation that the boundaries be refined using spatially explicit indicators of CH, specifically the environmental, oceanographic, and bathymetric conditions responsible for the copepod aggregations and distribution. We measured the concentration, energy density, spatial distribution, and extent of the right whale food base and the related oceanography at depth in the Basin during late-summer 2008 with the goal of refining the spatial extent of right whale CH. We show that the diapausing copepods were distributed throughout the Basin, with elevated concentrations located at depth toward the northeast and along the southern Basin margin slope. The aggregations were associated with warm, salty, high-density (26.0 to 26.2 δt, kg m-3), continental slope-influenced water masses and not with cold, fresh, low-density (&lt;26.0 δt) water masses originating on the Scotian Shelf. Tidally driven variation in the copepod aggregations across the southern slope was coincident with the movement of the 26.0 δt isopycnal. We propose a mechanism, based on water mass density and advection, that explains the spatial and temporal (e.g. inter-annual) variation in diapausing Calanus energy density (joules per unit ocean volume) distribution, and by proxy, variation in right whale occupancy of the Basin. We further propose that the provisional CH boundaries, partly conditioned on vessel-strike mitigation measures, be extended to better encompass the critical feeding habitat. This could be achieved without compromise regarding vessel traffic and existing vessel-strike mitigation. © 2014 Inter-Research.},

abstract={To enhance recovery of the Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, mitigation strategies are needed to reduce the leading causes of injury and mortality of these animals, which include ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Such efforts require information on the spatial and temporal distribution of right whales that can be analyzed against risk factors to identify solutions to protect whales while minimizing economic impacts to industry. Currently, no methods adequately make use of all available data to characterize right whale distribution, often leaving data gaps or misrepresenting whale activity in areas where we have limited systematic survey data. In response to this, an areal co-kriging interpolation technique was developed using ArcGIS 10.1 Geostatistical Analyst, utilizing all available right whale location data including systematic survey data, opportunistic sightings data, and satellite tag data. With many management plans shaped around specific geographic zones, this methodology was developed with the option to summarize information within user-defined polygons depending on the management regime. For this paper, whale distribution predictions were summarized to 524 irregularly shaped polygons off coastal Maine, representing lobster fishing zones at a 2 mo temporal scale. Results indicate that the predicted values fall within reasonable ranges, appropriately represent seasonal differences, and better represent right whale distribution patterns compared to other methods. © Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis calve during winter off Florida and Georgia, USA, a region of high shipping traffic, and ship-strike risk is a concern. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of right whales on their foraging grounds increases detection opportunities to inform mariners of right whale presence and reduce the likelihood of ship strike. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PAM on right whale calving grounds by documenting the occurrence of right whale call detections on 2 types of acoustic instruments deployed off the coasts of Savannah, GA, and Jacksonville, FL, and comparing results with visual sightings and ambient noise conditions. Over 400 right whale calling events were detected on archival marine acoustic recording units (MARUs) at 2 sites across 2 seasons, and 92% of these calling events included right whale upcalls. Daily detections on archival MARUs and near-real time Autobuoys, which automatically detect upcalls, were significantly correlated and occurred on up to 25% of days off Savannah and 46% of days off Jacksonville. Visual aerial surveys detected right whales within 20km of each acoustic site on a similar proportion of days with visual survey effort (15 to 33% off Savannah and 34 to 43% off Jacksonville). Acoustic methods enabled greater temporal effort, yielding a 2- to 10-fold increase in days with right whale detections over visual methods. Shipping noise and fish chorusing likely mask right whale call detections. However, considering the high number of right whale calling event detections by PAM during this study the results indicate that this is an effective method to augment detection of right whales in this environment, especially at night when they cannot be seen.},

abstract={A major and immediate goal of the US Marine Mammal Protection Act is the reduction of marine mammal mortality incidental with commercial fishing operations. Under articles of the Act, the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) was developed and implemented to reduce entanglement mortality of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, Gulf of Maine humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, and western North Atlantic fin whales Balaenoptera physalus by requiring modifications to commercial fishing gear (i.e. pots and sink gillnets). Although they undercount the number of entanglements, counts of detected incidents of entanglements and entanglement-related mortality are the primary index to entanglement mortality. We analyzed the annual counts of large whale entanglements including serious injuries and mortalities attributed to entanglements to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALWTRP from 1999 to 2009. The annual number of mortality events (including serious injuries) related to fishing gear entanglements averaged 2.5 for right whales, 6.5 for humpbacks, 0.6 for fin whales, and 2.4 for minke whales B. acutorostrata. Annual entanglement rates increased during the study period, but evidence for increased rates of entanglement-related mortality was equivocal. No significant changes occurred in waiting time (the number of days between entanglement events) in response to any management measures implemented to reduce large whale mortalities between 1998 and 2009, implying that these measures were generally ineffective in abating whale deaths from entanglements in fishing gear.},

abstract={As a precautionary measure to protect the culturally-significant bowhead whale ( Balaena mysticetus) from vessel strike, this paper explores the potential for having the International Maritime Organization endorse ships' routeing measures in the Bering Strait region. The confined nature of the Bering Strait forces both vessel traffic and the migrating Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales to occupy the same narrow space, thus putting individual animals at risk of vessel strike. The potential for vessel strike may become exacerbated as the reduction of Arctic sea ice makes the Arctic increasingly accessible, allowing vessels to transit through the Strait in greater densities. In drawing from lessons learned in the successful reduction of vessel strike to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), the author provides broad recommendations for implementing ships' routeing measures in the Bering Strait region based on findings by Citta et al. (2012). It is recommended that both the western side of Big Diomede Island and the western side of St. Lawrence Island be designated as seasonal Areas To Be Avoided (ATBA) during fall months when bowheads are known to inhabit the area. Alternatively, it is proposed that Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) be implemented so that vessels must keep to the eastern side of both Big Diomede Island and St. Lawrence Island during this time. Both measures would reduce the amount of overlap between migrating bowhead whales and transiting vessel traffic, effectively reducing the potential for vessel strike. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Differing physical characteristics and levels of biological, environmental, and anthropogenic sounds contribute in varying levels of noise in different ocean environments. As a result, animals migrating over large ranges or widely distributed species are now exposed to a myriad of different acoustic environments, within which they must navigate, forage and reproduce. Given current increases in low-frequency (<. 1000. Hz) anthropogenic noise, there is concern that resultant masking of communication and naturally occurring sounds may stress cetaceans already facing other forms of habitat degradation. As a critical first step to understanding the acoustic environments of coastal marine ecosystems, we examined month-long acoustic data from ten sites along the U.S. east coast that are either designated critical habitats or located along the migratory corridor of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis): Gulf of Maine, Jeffreys Ledge, Massachusetts Bay, Cape Cod Bay, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia (North), and Georgia (South). Data were collected using hydrophones positioned at depth to evaluate differences in the acoustic environment at these sites. High noise levels were observed at both major (New York, Boston) and non-major (Georgia) shipping ports located in or near the areas of study. Of the ten study sites, New Jersey and New York experienced the highest equivalent sound levels, while South Carolina and the Gulf of Maine presented the lowest. The majority of noise variability was found in low-frequency bands below 500. Hz, including the 71-224. Hz communication range utilized by long distance, contact-calling right whales and many other whale and fish species. The spatio-temporal variability of anthropogenic noise can be viewed as a form of habitat fragmentation, where inundations of noise may mask key sounds, resulting in a loss of "acoustic space" (overlapping frequency band and time of a whale's vocalization), which could otherwise be occupied by vocalizations and other acoustic cues utilized by cetaceans. This loss of acoustic space could potentially degrade habitat suitability by reducing the geographic distance across which individuals acoustically communicate, and ultimately, over long timescales, disrupt aspects related to their natural behavior and ecology. Because communication plays a vital role in the life history of cetacean species, understanding temporal and geographical differences in ambient noise as part of cetacean ecology and habitat may elucidate future conservation strategies related to the assessment of noise impacts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To reduce right whale Eubalaena glacialis deaths caused by ship collisions along the US East Coast, a rule was implemented on 8 December 2008 requiring all vessels ≥65 feet (19.8 m) to travel 10 knots (18.5 km h-1) or less in 10 seasonal management areas (SMAs). To evaluate the effectiveness of this rule, we plotted the locations of all right whale and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae carcasses attributed to ship-strikes since December 1990 in US waters to determine their proximity to SMAs. In the 18 yr pre-rule period, 13 of 15 (87%) right whales and 12 of 26 (46%) humpback whales killed by ships were found inside later SMA boundaries or within 45 nmi (83 km) of their perimeters during later active dates. In the first 5 yr after the rule became effective, no ship-struck right whales were found inside or within 45 nmi of any active SMA. This was nearly twice as long as the longest pre-rule period without discovery of a ship-struck carcass in those areas during effective time periods. Based on the 18 yr pre-rule period, bootstrap resampling analyses revealed that the probability of finding no ship-struck whales in or near SMAs during the first 5 yr post-rule period would be a statistically significant reduction in such deaths (p = 0.031). The results suggest the rule has been effective at reducing right whale deaths. We suggest enlarging SMAs to include additional parts of the right whale migratory corridor. © Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract={Protracted entanglement in fishing gear often leads to emaciation through reduced mobility and foraging ability, and energy budget depletion from the added drag of towing gear for months or years. We examined changes in kinematics of a tagged entangled North Atlantic right whale (Eg 3911), before, during, and after disentanglement on 15 January 2011. To calculate the additional drag forces and energetic demand associated with various gear configurations, we towed three sets of gear attached to a load-cell tensiometer at multiple speeds. Tag analyses revealed significant increases in dive depth and duration; ascent, descent and fluke stroke rates; and decreases in root mean square fluke amplitude (a proxy for thrust) following disentanglement. Conservative drag coefficients while entangled in all gear configurations (mean ± SD Cd,e,go = 3.4 × 10-3 ± 0.0003, Cd,e,gb = 3.7 × 10-3 ± 0.0003, Cd,e,sl = 3.8 × 10-3 ± 0.0004) were significantly greater than in the nonentangled case (Cd,n = 3.2 × 10-3 ± 0.0003; P = 0.0156, 0.0312, 0.0078, respectively). Increases in total power input (including standard metabolism) over the nonentangled condition ranged from 1.6% to 120.9% for all gear configurations tested; locomotory power requirements increased 60.0%-164.6%. These results highlight significant alteration to swimming patterns, and the magnitude of energy depletion in a chronically entangled whale. © 2013 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Buoyancy is an important consideration for diving marine animals, resulting in specific ecologically relevant adaptations. Marine mammals use blubber as an energy reserve, but because this tissue is also positively buoyant, nutritional demands have the potential to cause considerable variation in buoyancy. North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis are known to be positively buoyant as a result of their blubber, and the thickness of this layer varies considerably, but the effect of this variation on buoyancy has not been explored. This study compared the duration and rate of ascending and descending glides, recorded with an archival tag, with blubber thickness, measured with an ultrasound device, in free-swimming right whales. Ascending whales with thicker blubber had shorter portions of active propulsion and longer passive glides than whales with thinner blubber, suggesting that blubber thickness influences buoyancy because the buoyant force is acting in the same direction as the animal's movement during this phase. Whales with thinner layers also used similar body angles and velocities when traveling to and from depth, while those with thicker layers used shallower ascent angles but achieved higher ascent velocities. Such alterations in body angle may help to reduce the cost of transport when swimming against the force of buoyancy in a state of augmented positive buoyancy, which represents a dynamic response to reduce the energetic consequences of physiological changes. These results have considerable implications for any diving marine animal during periods of nutritional stress, such as during seasonal migrations and annual variations in prey availability. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Living gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are key consumers in benthic communities of the North Pacific Ocean. Gray whales, however, also inhabited the North Atlantic Ocean until recent historical times (~. 1600. AD), leaving open questions about their historical ecology in nearshore communities of this basin. Here we report the discovery of fossil remains from two individual gray whales recovered from underwater excavations at separate localities of JY Reef, an offshore reef situated approximately 32. kilometers (km) offshore of St. Catherine's Island, Georgia, U.S.A. Both mandibles are diagnostic to the living E. robustus. Radiometric dating of shells from JY Reef suggests an approximate age range of these two specimens between 42 and 30. thousand years before present (ka). Morphological measurements of the preserved elements indicate that both of the mandibles likely belonged to immature and possibly yearling individuals. Collectively, these findings are among the oldest occurrences of gray whales in the North Atlantic basin, and their presence at temperate latitudes provides limited support for the hypothesis that Atlantic gray whales used a southerly breeding area at the end of a migratory pathway, by analog with lagoonal breeding environments of Baja California, Mexico, for the extant California gray whales, and the breeding areas for the extant North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) off the Georgia coast today. Stronger support for this latter contention may stem from future fossil discoveries in the region, as well as ancillary lines of evidence, such as the remains of species-specific ectoparasites and/or ancient DNA (aDNA).© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Passive acoustic surveys were conducted to assess the vocal behavior of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the designated critical calving habitat along the shallow coastal waters of southeastern United States. Underwater vocalizations were recorded using autonomous buoys deployed in close proximity to surface active groups (SAGs). Nine main vocalization types were identified with manual inspection of spectrograms, and standard acoustic descriptors were extracted. Classification trees were used to examine the distinguishing characteristics of calls and quantify their variability within the SAG vocal repertoire. The results show that descriptors of frequency, bandwidth, and spectral disorder are the most important parameters for partitioning the SAG repertoire, contrary to duration-related measures. The reported source levels and vocalization statistics provide sound production data vital to inform regional passive acoustic monitoring and conservation for this endangered species. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Ship strike is the major anthropogenic source of mortality for severely endangered North Atlantic right whales. Two primary tools are given to US wildlife managers by the Endangered Species Act post-listing to ensure species survival by reducing negative anthropogenic impacts: (1) creating a recovery plan and (2) defining and protecting critical habitat. This study reviews and analyzes the impact these strategies have had in reducing North Atlantic right whale ship strike mortality in US waters from 1973 to 2011. Defining and protecting critical habitat poses distinct spatial and human-use overlap challenges when applied to highly migratory species. Managers should consider two different levels in designating critical habitat for highly migratory species such as the North Atlantic right whale: permanently protected critical habitat in areas where species take up seasonal residence, and temporarily protected migratory habitat to maintain functional migration corridors between seasonal residence critical habitat areas. Managers and stakeholders should also be aware that, given current definitions for North Atlantic right whale critical habitat, human-use overlap in critical habitat areas is inevitable. Instead of eliminating human-use in critical habitat, wildlife managers should apply a combination of adaptive human-behaviors, functional habitat definitions, and on-going habitat-use studies to reduce ship strike mortality, particularly for pregnant and nursing females. Ascertaining methods to effectively manage North Atlantic right whale critical habitat is particularly relevant as current regulatory actions aimed at reducing North Atlantic right whale ship strike mortality will be reviewed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in December 2013, offering wildlife managers an opportunity to adjust current ship strike mortality reduction strategies in order to improve the population growth rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Multipath localization techniques have not previously been applied to baleen whale vocalizations due to difficulties in application to tonal vocalizations. Here it is shown that an autocorrelation method coupled with the direct reflected time difference of arrival localization technique can successfully resolve location information. A derivation was made to model the autocorrelation of a direct signal and its overlapping reflections to illustrate that an autocorrelation may be used to extract reflection information from longer duration signals containing a frequency sweep, such as some calls produced by baleen whales. An analysis was performed to characterize the difference in behavior of the autocorrelation when applied to call types with varying parameters (sweep rate, call duration). The method's feasibility was tested using data from playback transmissions to localize an acoustic transducer at a known depth and location. The method was then used to estimate the depth and range of a single North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) from two separate experiments. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Currently there are three recognized species of right whales. The largest population is the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), with circumpolar distribution in the southern hemisphere. One calving area for this population is in Brazilian waters, where increasing numbers of right whales have been sighted over the past decade along with an increase in anthropogenic activities including shipping traffic and fishing. The goals of this study were to describe the vocal behavior of southern right whales in Brazilian waters, assess the difference in vocalizations between areas with low and high human activity, and compare these results to studies conducted with North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Western North Atlantic. Bottom-mounted archival acoustic recorders were deployed in October and November 2011 in two coastal locations in central Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. One recorder was placed off Gamboa (27°56'S and 48°39'W, low traffic) and a second off Ribanceira (28°11'S and 48°37'W, high traffic). Automated detectors and noise statistic analysis tools developed for North Atlantic right whale upcalls were utilized to analyze the dataset. Calls produced by Brazilian whales were significantly lower in fundamental frequency than North Atlantic right whale calls and the implications for these results will be discussed. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Body condition is an indicator of health, and it plays a key role in many vital processes for mammalian species. While evidence of individual body condition can be obtained, these observations provide just brief glimpses into the health state of the animal. An analytical framework is needed for understanding how health of animals changes over space and time.Through knowledge of individual health we can better understand the status of populations. This is particularly important in endangered species, where the consequences of disruption of critical biological functions can push groups of animals rapidly toward extinction. Here we built a state-space model that provides estimates of movement, health, and survival. We assimilated 30+ years of photographic evidence of body condition and three additional visual health parameters in individual North Atlantic right whales, together with survey data, to infer the true health status as it changes over space and time. We also included the effect of reproductive status and entanglement status on health. At the population level, we estimated differential movement patterns in males and females. At the individual level, we estimated the likely animal locations each month. We estimated the relationship between observed and latent health status. Observations of body condition, skin condition, cyamid infestation on the blowholes, and rake marks all provided measures of the true underlying health. The resulting time series of individual health highlight both normal variations in health status and how anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and, ultimately, the survival of individuals. This modeling approach provides information for monitoring of health in right whales, as well as a framework for integrating observational data at the level of individuals up through the health status of the population. This framework can be broadly applied to a variety of systems - terrestrial and marine - where sporadic observations of individuals exist. © 2013 Schick et al.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis foraging on deep (&gt;100 m) populations of diapausing Calanus spp. in the Roseway Basin right whale Critical Habitat (south of Nova Scotia, Canada) are most often located along the southern margin of the basin. We investigated the physical and biological oceanographic characteristics that make this margin a lucrative feeding ground. Bottom-moored acoustic Doppler current profilers equipped with conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors were deployed cross-isobath on the southeastern slope of the basin to simultaneously measure variation in Calanus spp. concentration, current velocity, and water mass characteristics in time and space. Variation in upslope tidal advection of deep-basin water with densities &gt;1026 kg m-3 and containing highly concentrated copepod aggregations was the most important process influencing cross-isobath variation in copepod concentrations on the slope. The aggregations were maintained in the slope region through time despite extensive along-isobath advection, implying the existence of copepod re-supply mechanisms to the southern margin. Proposed mechanisms include immigration from surface populations, horizontal advection, and gyrelike re-circulation within the basin. A simple empirically-driven particle tracking model illustrated tidally-forced particle convergence between the 100 and 140 m isobaths on the southeastern slope, followed by upward and along-isobath advection. Cross-isobath 'compression' of copepods coupled with the maintenance of their vertical position through neutral buoyancy is proposed as a mechanism resulting in accumulation on the slope, making the area uniquely beneficial to right whales feeding at depth along the slope margin. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={Collisions with vessels are a serious threat to a number of endangered large whale species, the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) in particular. In late 2008, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued mandatory time-area vessel speed restrictions along the U.S. eastern seaboard in an effort to mediate collision-related mortality of right whales. All vessels 65 feet and greater in length are restricted to speeds of 10 knots or less during seasonally implemented regulatory periods. We modeled mortality risk of North Atlantic right whale when the vessel restrictions were and were not in effect, including (1) estimation of the probability of lethal injury given a ship strike as a function of vessel speed, (2) estimation of the effect of transit speed on the instantaneous rate of ship strikes, and (3) a consideration of total risk reduction. Logistic regression and Bayesian probit analyses indicated a significant positive relationship between ship speed and the probability of a lethal injury. We found that speeds of vessels that struck whales were consistently greater than typical vessel speeds for each vessel type and regulatory period studied; a use-availability model fit to these data provided strong evidence for a linear effect of transit speed on strike rates. Overall, we estimated that vessel speed restrictions reduced total ship strike mortality risk levels by 80-90% with levels that were closer to 90% in the latter two of the four active vessel speed restriction periods studied. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assessment to date of the utility of vessel speed restrictions in reducing the threat of vessel collisions to large whales. Our findings indicate that vessel speed limits are a powerful tool for reducing anthropogenic mortality risk for North Atlantic right whales. Copyright: © 2013 Conn and Silber.},

abstract={A chronically entangled North Atlantic right whale, with consequent emaciation was sedated, disentangled to the extent possible, administered antibiotics, and satellite tag tracked for six subsequent days. It was found dead 11 d after the tag ceased transmission. Chronic constrictive deep rope lacerations and emaciation were found to be the proximate cause of death, which may have ultimately involved shark predation. A broadhead cutter and a spring-loaded knife used for disentanglement were found to induce moderate wounds to the skin and blubber. The telemetry tag, with two barbed shafts partially penetrating the blubber was shed, leaving barbs embedded with localized histological reaction. One of four darts administered shed the barrel, but the needle was found postmortem in the whale with an 80o bend at the blubber-muscle interface. This bend occurred due to epaxial muscle movement relative to the overlying blubber, with resultant necrosis and cavitation of underlying muscle. This suggests that rigid, implanted devices that span the cetacean blubber muscle interface, where the muscle moves relative to the blubber, could have secondary health impacts. Thus we encourage efforts to develop new tag telemetry systems that do not penetrate the subdermal sheath, but still remain attached for many months. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Management plans for North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis focus on preventing mortality from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement. However, recovery may also be limited because individuals are under nutritional stress. We quantified the food requirements of North Atlantic right whales by age, sex and reproductive state and compared their predicted needs with field estimates of prey consumption to assess whether any demographic group of right whales might be nutritionally stressed. Energy requirements were estimated using a bioener - getics model that accounted for uncertainty in energy inputs and outputs. Consumption was estimated with prey samples taken near feeding whales in Cape Cod Bay (n = 28 net collections) and the Bay of Fundy (n = 19 optical plankton recordings). We found that calves required the least energy (~1767 MJ d-1) and that lactating females required the most (~4120 MJ d -1). Juveniles required considerably more energy than adult males and non-reproductive females. Our estimates of energy requirements for juveniles (~1906 MJ d-1), adult males (~1793 MJ d-1), and nonreproductive females (~2104 MJ d-1) compared favorably with estimates of actual consumption in Cape Cod Bay and the Bay of Fundy (i.e. they differed by ≤15%), suggesting that our model was reliable. However, lactating females appear to have obtained considerably less than their predicted energy requirements in both habitats. These findings suggest that lactating females may be experiencing an energy deficit, which may affect reproductive rates and slow population recovery. Nutritional stress may thus be limiting the recovery of North Atlantic right whales. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={In a portion of the coastal waters of northeastern Florida, North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) occur close to shore from December through March. These waters are included within the designated critical habitat for right whales. Data on swim speed, behavior, and direction of movement - with photo-identification of individual whales - were gathered by a volunteer sighting network working alongside experienced scientists and supplemented by aerial observations. In seven years (2001-2007), 109 tracking periods or "follows" were conducted on right whales during 600 hours of observation from shore-based observers. The whales were categorized as mother-calf pairs, singles and non-mother-calf pairs, and groups of 3 or more individuals. Sample size and amount of information obtained was largest for mother-calf pairs. Swim speeds varied within and across observation periods, individuals, and categories. One category, singles and non mother-calf pairs, was significantly different from the other two - and had the largest variability and the fastest swim speeds. Median swim speed for all categories was 1.3 km/h (0.7 kn), with examples that suggest swim speeds differ between within-habitat movement and migration-mode travel. Within-habitat right whales often travel back-and-forth in a north-south, along-coast, direction, which may cause an individual to pass by a given point on several occasions, potentially increasing anthropogenic risk exposure (e.g., vessel collision, fishing gear entanglement, harassment). At times, mothers and calves engaged in lengthy stationary periods (up to 7.5 h) that included rest, nursing, and play. These mother-calf interactions have implications for communication, learning, and survival. Overall, these behaviors are relevant to population status, distribution, calving success, correlation to environmental parameters, survey efficacy, and human-impacts mitigation. These observations contribute important parameters to conservation biology, predictive modeling, and management. However, while we often search for predictions, patterns, and means, the message here is also about variability and the behavioral characteristics of individual whales. © 2013 Hain et al.},

abstract={The presence of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA is not well understood. Adequate protection of right whales in the face of plans to develop offshore renewable energy requires more information about this species' distribution and occurrence in this region. We present findings from the first year-round study dedicated to marine mammals in New Jersey's nearshore waters using line transect surveys and passive acoustic monitoring. Four groups of right whales, including a cow-calf pair, were sighted. Right whales were detected acoustically during all seasons. Sightings of females and subsequent confirmations of these same individuals in the calving grounds a month or less later illustrate that these waters are part of this species' migratory corridor. Observations of skim-feeding behavior suggest that feeding may also occur in areas farther south than the main feeding grounds. Based on the year-round occurrence of right whales offNew Jersey, we recommend that presumed seasonal migratory patterns not be used alone to determine the timing of construction activities or monitoring/mitigation efforts for offshore development. Our results also provide support for the expansion of existing critical habitat to include nearshore waters of the mid-Atlantic. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={Stage V (C5) Calanus finmarchicus is a central prey item for animals feeding at several trophic levels in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, especially the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. Here, we show that the energy and lipid content of C5 C. finmarchicus collected twice monthly (July to September) from the Grand Manan Basin exhibited significant variation over multiple years (2006 to 2010). Mean ± SD wet mass energy (6.77 ± 0.65 kJ g-1) was highest in 2007 and lowest in 2009 (5.82 ± 0.90 kJ g-1); lipid content followed the same pattern. Significant decreases in individual energy content were observed over the summer during 2006 and 2010. Lipid content was significantly correlated with energy content. Overall, energy content of copepods was 13% lower in 2009 than in 2006-2007, which could alter foraging patterns and activity budgets of predators such as the North Atlantic right whale and have implications for assessment of whale habitat based on models of energy requirements. Variation in C5 quality may be linked to annual changes in the lipid content of Bay of Fundy herring, which consume copepods and are in turn a main prey item of seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. Our study emphasizes that variation in quality, not just quantity, of prey should be considered when formulating predator consumption models and in tracking trophic transfer. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={This paper describes ongoing work to investigate the development of a complex system designed for extracting information from large acoustic datasets. The system, called DeLMA is based on integrating advanced machine learning with high performance computing (HPC). The goal of this work is to provide the capability to accurately detect and classify whale sounds in large acoustics datasets collected using underwater sensors. The case study for this work is focused on detecting the acoustic communication signals of the North Atlantic Right Whale, <ce:italic>Eubalaena glacialis</ce:italic>, and uses data collected in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. A summary of the work done for developing a complex detection-classification system and brief description of several algorithms that are used for classifying whale sounds will be covered. A brief discussion on how standard detection algorithms can be incorporated, with no special modifications, into the HPC system for analysis will be mentioned, and two new right whale detection methods are presented, based on continuous region analysis (CRA) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). This paper presents a first-hand look at applying the DeLMA system and these algorithms on a large dataset containing over 60,000 channel-hours of acoustic data from the SBNMS. Results from these new detection methods are compared against Baseline algorithms. With the development of the DeLMA system, sound archives can now be explored using a powerful distributed processing architecture. This advancement will allow for rapid execution and visualization of the data using seasonal graphs called diel plots, which show the distribution of detections on a time-of-day vs. time-of-year plane. Diel plots of Baseline, CRA and HOG algorithm results reveal various large-scale features of the seasonality of whale calling behavior. Results are summarized and the authors discuss future areas for study, especially those relate to handling other big passive acoustic data projects. © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) from the western North Atlantic population, sighted in the Azores, was subsequently found to have moved back to the northwest Atlantic. The whale was sighted in the Azores on 5 January 2009 travelling in a west-south westerly direction at a constant speed. A photographic match was found to an adult female in the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue. The whale's previous last sighting, on 24 September 2008 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, implies movement to the Azores of at least 3,320km in 101 days. It was subsequently resighted in the Bay of Fundy on 2 September 2009, 237 days after being seen in the Azores. This appears to be the only documented evidence of a western North Atlantic right whale outside its normal range in winter, and provides additional evidence of the potential for interbreeding between western North Atlantic right whales and the remnant eastern population.},

abstract={The effects of chronic exposure to increasing levels of human-induced underwater noise on marine animal populations reliant on sound for communication are poorly understood. We sought to further develop methods of quantifying the effects of communication masking associated with human-induced sound on contact-calling North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in an ecologically relevant area (∼10,000 km2) and time period (peak feeding time). We used an array of temporary, bottom-mounted, autonomous acoustic recorders in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary to monitor ambient noise levels, measure levels of sound associated with vessels, and detect and locate calling whales. We related wind speed, as recorded by regional oceanographic buoys, to ambient noise levels. We used vessel-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System to quantify acoustic signatures of large commercial vessels. On the basis of these integrated sound fields, median signal excess (the difference between the signal-to-noise ratio and the assumed recognition differential) for contact-calling right whales was negative (-1 dB) under current ambient noise levels and was further reduced (-2 dB) by the addition of noise from ships. Compared with potential communication space available under historically lower noise conditions, calling right whales may have lost, on average, 63-67% of their communication space. One or more of the 89 calling whales in the study area was exposed to noise levels ≥120 dB re 1 μPa by ships for 20% of the month, and a maximum of 11 whales were exposed to noise at or above this level during a single 10-min period. These results highlight the limitations of exposure-threshold (i.e., dose-response) metrics for assessing chronic anthropogenic noise effects on communication opportunities. Our methods can be used to integrate chronic and wide-ranging noise effects in emerging ocean-planning forums that seek to improve management of cumulative effects of noise on marine species and their habitats. ©2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={We used a combination of AIS and RADAR to characterize large (≥ 65' long) vessel traffic in the Chesapeake Bay ocean approach along the US eastern seaboard from May 2008 through April 2009. During the 60 days of monthly surveys, we recorded over 2.6×106 records of data with ship position information. There were 1181 hours of AIS and 540 hours of RADAR data collected for a monthly mean of 98 and 45 hours for AIS and RADAR respectively. These data represented 1411 transits by vessels broadcasting AIS for a total of 69,606km of track line, and vessels acquired with RADAR represented a total of 506 transits for a total of 8,702km of track line. AIS and RADAR data resulted in 1.2 and 0.9 transits per hour respectively. We corrected the AIS data to match RADAR effort, and, when effort was equal, AIS data represented only 49.7% of the total large vessel transits observed, and transits per hour were equal for corrected AIS and RADAR data. We recorded more inbound vessels using AIS and more outbound vessels with RADAR. The density pattern of vessels recorded using AIS differed from the RADAR pattern. There was a very discrete pattern for vessels broadcasting an AIS signal that corresponded with the shipping lane buoys. Vessels recorded using RADAR, on the other hand, were more dispersed and displayed a less discrete pattern covering a large area outside of the ship buoys. Winter was the season with the fewest vessel transits for both data collection methods (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), though there was not a substantial decrease over other seasons in the AIS data. Spring, summer and fall were similar for AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% respectively), but fall (31.4%) had considerably more vessels recorded by RADAR than spring and summer (26.5%, 25.1% respectively). When examining vessel type data, more than two thirds of the vessel transits recorded using AIS were cargo vessels (68%; n=337). Excluding unknown vessels, military vessels made up 47% (n=179) of the vessels we identified with RADAR, followed by fishing (32%; n=120) and federal law enforcement (USCG) vessels (10%, n=38). Spatial analysis was necessary to accurately evaluate ship speed over the entire study area. Spatial analyses of these data allowed us to examine speed behavior in a grid format, reducing the effect of directional bias from an overrepresentation of records from relatively slow moving vessels. Without utilizing spatial analysis, one could draw the conclusion that vessels were transiting the area more slowly than they actually were because AIS speed records are skewed by the greater number of speed points for slower vessels. There was an obvious reduction in speed of vessels transmitting AIS in the shipping lanes from before to after the Ship Strike Rule that was enacted in December 2008 to protect the western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The Ship Strike Rule identified a Seasonal Management Area (SMA) within which commercial ships ≥65 ft. in length were required to slow to 10kts or less for part of the year (50 CFR224.105). Although vessels slowed, many were not in compliance with the mandatory speed limit of the Rule. Speed restrictions had no effect on vessels observed using RADAR, most of which were not required to comply with the regulations. Cargo ships can be quite large and travel at speeds in excess of 20kt, and were required to broadcast AIS signals, so their behavior was relatively easy to assess. Few cargo vessels traveled 10kt or less for an entire transit through the SMA. Thus, we observed an apparent reaction to the speed restrictions in the SMA, but did not observe strict compliance. Recently the US Coast Guard has begun issuing speeding citations to vessels that have been recorded blatantly disregarding the speed restrictions in SMAs. We applaud these efforts and suspect that if the effort continues consistently it will encourage compliance. Our data suggest that AIS traffic levels were relatively constant (∼1.2 transits/hr) around the clock. For this project, we chose to operate the RADAR unit during daylight hours in order to assess vessel type and approximate length from the shore-based platform. In the future, we need to assess RADAR vessel traffic during all hours in order to better compare it to AIS traffic. In 2007, Virginia ports were listed as the third busiest port on the U.S. Atlantic coast for vessel calls. A large portion of the vessels calls for the port of Baltimore also enter at Chesapeake Bay. The addition of commercial Baltimore traffic as well as federal and fishing vessels not broadcasting AIS very likely makes the Chesapeake Bay approach one of the two busiest coastal port approaches and may make it the busiest in the western North Atlantic. This project raises numerous questions about vessel traffic patterns, vessel speeds, risks to whales and data incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts. There is a definite need for both longer-reaching ship RADAR data and more detailed whale presence data in the mid-Atlantic region, especially off its busiest port. Without data on whale presence, it is nearly impossible to answer questions about the level of risk that the vessel traffic patterns present for whales and on how installations of offshore wind and other energy ventures may affect whales and ships. This project brings into question the use of AIS data alone as an accurate representation of large vessel traffic in coastal regions of the United States, especially in areas with high fishing and military traffic. In Virginia, during daylight hours, AIS data represent a maximum of two thirds, and, as little as one half, of the large vessel (&gt;65 feet) traffic in the Chesapeake Bay approach. Further research is needed to address the accurate determination of vessel size when using RADAR. A mobile research platform with the capability of assessing RADAR targets on the water or an offshore platform with a greater range and use of night vision technology may provide solutions. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Entanglement in non-mobile fishing gear has been identified as one of the leading causes of mortality in North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis. To investigate this issue further, all available photographs of right whales taken from 1980 to 2009 were examined for evidence of entanglement with gear used in fisheries based on presence of rope or netting on the whale or scars inferred to have been caused by an encounter with rope. Photographs of 626 individual whales were assessed and 1032 unique entanglement events were documented. Of the 626 animals, 519 (82.9%) had been entangled at least once and 306 of the 519 (59.0%) had been entangled more than once. Males and females were entangled at similar rates. Juveniles were entangled at a higher rate than adults. On average, 25.9% of adequately photographed animals acquired new wounds or scars from fishing gear annually with no significant trend over time detected. However, the annual percentage of animals observed with rope on the body increased significantly during the study period, suggesting that it is becoming more difficult for whales to free themselves completely from fishing gear. Such high annual rates of entanglement remain a serious conservation concern for right whales because entanglements can have both lethal and sub-lethal effects. Federally required changes to fixed-gear fisheries in US waters have not reduced serious injuries and mortality to legally required levels. Here we show how documenting various annual rates of entanglement can monitor progress and impacts that fishing gear regulations may have on right whale recovery. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Body growth of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) was described from measurements of known-age live and dead individuals to gain insights into the nutritional needs and life-history strategies of this endangered species. Body lengths from 154 individuals revealed that calves more than doubled in size and attained three-fourths of asymptotic adult size by the time they had weaned at 12 months. Calves gained on average ∼1.7 cm and ∼34 kg per day while nursing during this extremely rapid growth phase. Mean predicted lengths and body mass were 4.2 m and 1.1 metric tons (mt) at birth, 10.3 m and 13.5 mt at weaning, and 13.6 m and 29.6 mt when fully grown. Growth of right whales was best described using a 2-phased Gompertz growth model and could not be fit using any of the single continuous growth models commonly used for other mammals. Rapid growth during dependency may minimize the risk of predation and maximize calf survival. Rapid calf growth also may maximize development of the mouth and baleen to optimize foraging efficiency of juveniles at the time of weaning, as well as improve reproductive fitness by reducing the age at which sexual maturity is attained. However, transferring the amount of energy needed to support the rapid postnatal growth of North Atlantic right whales may ultimately affect the intervals between pregnancies (>3 years) of mature females. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract={Nonmarket valuation research has produced economic value estimates for a variety of threatened, endangered, and rare species around the world. Although over 40 value estimates exist, it is often difficult to compare values from different studies due to variations in study design, implementation, and modeling specifications. We conducted a stated-preference choice experiment to estimate the value of recovering or downlisting 8 threatened and endangered marine species in the United States: loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), upper Willamette River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi), and smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). In May 2009, we surveyed a random sample of U.S. households. We collected data from 8476 households and estimated willingness to pay for recovering and downlisting the 8 species from these data. Respondents were willing to pay for recovering and downlisting threatened and endangered marine taxa. Willingness-to-pay values ranged from $40/household for recovering Puget Sound Chinook salmon to $73/household for recovering the North Pacific right whale. Statistical comparisons among willingness-to-pay values suggest that some taxa are more economically valuable than others, which suggests that the U.S. public's willingness to pay for recovery may vary by species. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Vessel strikes are the primary source of known mortality for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Multi-institutional efforts to reduce mortality associated with vessel strikes include vessel-routing amendments such as the International Maritime Organization voluntary "area to be avoided" (ATBA) in the Roseway Basin right whale feeding habitat on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. Though relative probabilities of lethal vessel strikes have been estimated and published, absolute probabilities remain unknown. We used a modeling approach to determine the regional effect of the ATBA, by estimating reductions in the expected number of lethal vessel strikes. This analysis differs from others in that it explicitly includes a spatiotemporal analysis of real-time transits of vessels through a population of simulated, swimming right whales. Combining automatic identification system (AIS) vessel navigation data and an observationally based whale movement model allowed us to determine the spatial and temporal intersection of vessels and whales, from which various probability estimates of lethal vessel strikes are derived. We estimate one lethal vessel strike every 0.775-2.07 years prior to ATBA implementation, consistent with and more constrained than previous estimates of every 2-16 years. Following implementation, a lethal vessel strike is expected every 41 years. When whale abundance is held constant across years, we estimate that voluntary vessel compliance with the ATBA results in an 82% reduction in the per capita rate of lethal strikes; very similar to a previously published estimate of 82% reduction in the relative risk of a lethal vessel strike. The models we developed can inform decision-making and policy design, based on their ability to provide absolute, population-corrected, time-varying estimates of lethal vessel strikes, and they are easily transported to other regions and situations. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Primary sources of mortality and serious injury to endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis are vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. All management plans depend on knowing when and where right whales are likely to be present. We tested the feasibility of a system designed to predict potential right whale habitat on a weekly time scale. The system paired right whale occurrence records with a collection of data layers including: results from a coupled biological-physical model of Calanus finmarchicus (the primary prey of right whales), satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, and bathymetry. Using these data, we trained seasonal habitat models and projected them onto environmental data for each 8 d period from January to June, 2002 to 2006. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) that right whale environmental preferences change from season to season and (2) that modeled prey concentration is an important predictor of the distribution of right whales. To test H1, we trained, tested, and compared models for 3 time periods: winter, spring, and winter and spring combined. To test H2, we trained and tested models with and without C. finmarchicus. Predictions of habitat suitability were highly dynamic within and across years. Our results support the hypothesis that right whale environmental preferences change between winter and spring. The inclusion of modeled C. finmarchicus abundance improved the accuracy of habitat suitability predictions. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Spatially-explicit habitat models can impart a scientific basis for delineating critical habitats that relate species' distributions to physical and biological conditions, even in marine environments with vague and dynamic boundaries. We developed a habitat model of the relationship between the winter distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, one of the most endangered large whales in the world, and environmental characteristics in its only identified calving ground, the waters off Florida and Georgia. Our objective was to provide a scientific basis for revising critical habitat boundaries in the southeastern USA (SEUS) and to predict potential habitat in the mid-Atlantic region north of the study area through a better understanding of the relationship of observed right whale distribution to environmental conditions. A long-term data set of right whale sightings from aerial surveys within the SEUS (conducted seasonally, December through March, from 1992/1993 to 2000/2001) was used in a generalized additive model to eval u -ate right whale distribution in relation to sea surface temperature, bathymetry, wind data, and several spatial variables. Model results indicated that sea surface temperature and water depth were significant predictors of calving right whale spatial distribution. The habitat relationships were unimodal, with peak sighting rates occurring at water temperatures of 13 to 15 oC and water depths of 10 to 20 m. Model results indicated areas of potentially important calving habitat outside currently defined critical habitat. Our semi-monthly predicted distributions, based on model results, provide managers with a range of scientifically based choices for revising critical habitat boundaries to achieve the desired level of protection. Predictions extrapolated through the mid-Atlantic suggested appropriate habitat features north of the study site, although analysis of data from more recent surveys in this region would be required to validate model results. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Species' conservation relies on understanding their seasonal habitats and migration routesNorth Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), listed as endangered under the U.SEndangered Species Act, migrate from the southeastern U.Scoast to Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, a federally designated critical habitat, from February through May to feedThe whales then continue north across the Gulf of Maine to northern waters (e.g., Bay of Fundy)To enter Cape Cod Bay, right whales must traverse an area of dense shipping and fishing activity in Massachusetts Bay, where there are no mandatory regulations for the protection of right whales or management of their habitatWe used passive acoustic recordings of right whales collected in Massachusetts Bay from May 2007 through October 2010 to determine the annual spatial and temporal distribution of the whales and their calling activityWe detected right whales in the bay throughout the year, in contrast to results from visual surveysRight whales were detected on at least 24% of days in each month, with the exception of June 2007, in which there were no detectionsAveraged over all years, right whale calls were most abundant from February through MayDuring this period, calls were most frequent between 17:00 and 20:00 local time; no diel pattern was apparent in other monthsThe spatial distribution of the approximate locations of calling whales suggests they may use Massachusetts Bay as a conduit to Cape Cod Bay in the spring and as they move between the Gulf of Maine and waters to the south in September through DecemberAlthough it is unclear how dependent right whales are on the bay, the discovery of their widespread presence in Massachusetts Bay throughout the year suggests this region may need to be managed to reduce the probability of collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Mammalian reproduction is metabolically regulated; therefore, the endangered status and high variability in reproduction of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis necessitate accurate assessments at sea of the nutritional condition of living individuals. Aerial photogrammetry was used to measure dorsal body width at multiple locations along the bodies of free-swimming right whales at different stages of the female reproductive cycle (E. glacialis) and during the initial months of lactation (mother and calf Eubalaena australis) to quantify changes in nutritional condition during energetically demanding events. Principal components analyses indicated that body width was most variable at 60% of the body length from the snout. Thoracic, abdominal and caudal body width of E. australis thinned significantly during the initial months of lactation, especially at 60% of body length from the snout, while their calves' widths and widthto- length ratios increased. The body shape of E. glacialis that had been lactating for 8 mo was significantly thinner than non-lactating, non-pregnant E. glacialis. Body shape of E. glacialis measured in the eighth month of lactation was significantly thinner than that of E. australis in the first month, but did not differ from that of E. australis in the third and fourth months. Body width was comparable with diameter calculated from girth of carcasses. These results indicate that mother right whales rely on endogenous nutrient reserves to support the considerable energy expenditure during the initial months of lactation; therefore, photogrammetric measurements of body width, particularly at 60% of body length from the snout, are an effective way to quantitatively and remotely assess nutritional condition of living right whales. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Balaenidae (right whales) are large, critically endangered baleen whales represented by four living species. The evolutionary relationships of balaenids are poorly known, with the number of genera, relationships to fossil taxa, and position within Mysticeti in contention. This study employs a comprehensive set of morphological characters to address aspects of balaenid phylogeny. A sister-group relationship between neobalaenids and balaenids is strongly supported, although this conflicts with molecular evidence, which may be an artifact of long-branch attraction (LBA). Monophyly of Balaenidae is supported, and three major clades are recognized: (1) extinct genus Balaenula, (2) extant and extinct species of the genus Eubalaena, and (3) extant and extinct species of the genus Balaena plus the extinct taxon, Balaenella. The relationships of these clades to one another, as well as to the early Miocene stem balaenid, Morenocetus parvus, remain unresolved. Pliocene taxa, Balaenula astensis and Balaenula balaenopsis, form a clade that is the sister group to the Japanese Pliocene Balaenula sp. Eubalaena glacialis and Pliocene Eubalaena belgica, are in an unresolved polytomy with a clade including E. japonica and E. australis. Extant and fossil species of Balaena form a monophyletic group that is sister group to the Dutch Pliocene Balaenella, although phylogenetic relationships within Balaena remain unresolved. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is a critically endangered large whale species found in waters off the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coasts. The primary human-caused threats are entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with vessels. Since 2002, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has implemented both seasonally and dynamically managed protective zones where right whales occur to reduce these threats; Seasonal Area Management (SAM) and Dynamic Area Management (DAM) for the reduction of right whale entanglements with fishing gear, and Seasonal Management Areas (SMA) and Dynamic Management Areas (DMA) for reduction of vessel collisions. This paper analyzes the presence of frequent concentrations of right whales outside of SAM and SMA zones, represented by the spatial and temporal occurrence of DAMs and DMAs. A grid of 1 min×1 min squares was geospatially applied to locations of DAMs and DMAs from April 2002 through June 2011 and the number of management areas that intersected each 1 min square was populated. DAMs and DMAs were most highly concentrated along the central Gulf of Maine. Of the 131 DAMs and DMAs implemented, 97 (74.0%) intersected this area, and were primarily implemented from October through February. The results of this analysis will aid in consideration of possible modifications to the size and location of SMAs along the northern Atlantic coast of the U.S. and other management actions for the reduction of vessel collisions with right whales. © 2012.},

abstract={Ship strikes are a major cause of anthropogenic mortality for the endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. Year-round data on animal presence are critical to managing ship strike mortality. Marine autonomous recording units were deployed throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS, Massachusetts Bay, USA) for 13 mo from January 2006 to February 2007 and on Jeffreys Ledge (JL, Gulf of Maine, USA) for 7 mo from November 2004 to May 2005 to determine whether passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can improve information on right whale occurrence. Automated detection and manual review were used to determine presence and absence of right whale up-calls. In SBNMS, up-calls were detected year round, except during July and August, and calling rates were highest from January through May, peaking in April. In JL, up-calls occurred throughout all recording months, with the highest numbers from November through February. Up-calls were heard extensively in the wintertime throughout SBNMS and JL, suggesting that these areas are important overwintering grounds for right whales. Additionally, up-calls showed a strong diel trend in both areas, with significantly more calls occurring during twilight than dark and light periods. These data indicate that right whales are present more often and over longer time periods in the western Gulf of Maine than previously thought using conventional visual techniques. Finally, this study demonstrates the utility of PAM in providing a detailed and long-term picture of right whale presence in an area that poses a significant risk of anthropogenic mortality. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Baleen whales (Mysticeti) communicate using low-frequency acoustic signals. These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances. Low-frequency noise from large ships (20–200 Hz) overlaps acoustic signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement, behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for recovery of this endangered right whale population. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The objective of this paper was to investigate and illustrate how insights gained from experience managing human activities in order to protect North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) along the heavily industrialized east coast of North America might be applied in the Arctic, where bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) face some of the same risks as right whales. The reduced extent and thickness of sea ice and the resultant longer open-water season have major, complex implications for the Arctic marine ecosystem. Increased maritime ship traffic and commercial fishing in the Arctic are bound to affect bowheads and Native (indigenous) hunting communities who depend on whales for subsistence and cultural identity. Bowheads and right whales were greatly depleted by commercial whaling in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Western Arctic bowhead population has been recovering steadily in recent decades, North Atlantic right whales remain highly endangered because of persistent lethal and sublethal vessel strikes and frequent entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Entanglement can be transitory or persistent, with debilitation lasting for months before the animal finally succumbs. Vessel strike and fishing gear trauma has been documented in bowheads, but at a much lower rate than in right whales. Initiatives intended to mitigate the impacts of ship traffic on North Atlantic right whales have included speed limits and routing changes. Those meant to reduce the incidence and severity of entanglements include the modification of gear design and gear deployment practices. Management measures need to be considered in advance in the Arctic in order to minimize the risks to bowhead whales as shipping and industrial fishing expand in the Arctic with ice retreat. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales are critically endangered and, despite international protection from whaling, significant numbers die from collisions with ships. Large groups of right whales migrate to the coastal waters of New England during the late winter and early spring to feed in an area with large numbers of vessels. North Atlantic right whales have the largest per capita record of vessel strikes of any large whale population in the world. Right whale feeding behaviour in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) probably contributes to risk of collisions with ships. In this study, feeding right whales tagged with archival suction cup tags spent the majority of their time just below the water's surface where they cannot be seen but are shallow enough to be vulnerable to ship strike. Habitat surveys show that large patches of right whale prey are common in the upper 5 m of the water column in CCB during spring. These results indicate that the typical spring-time foraging ecology of right whales may contribute to their high level of mortality from vessel collisions. The results of this study suggest that remote acoustic detection of prey aggregations may be a useful supplement to the management and conservation of right whales. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The western North Atlantic population of right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) is one of the most critically endangered of any whale population in the world. Among the factors considered to have potentially adverse effects on the health and reproduction of E. glacialis are biotoxins produced by certain microalgae responsible for causing harmful algal blooms. The worldwide incidence of these events has continued to increase dramatically over the past several decades and is expected to remain problematic under predicted climate change scenarios. Previous investigations have demonstrated that N. Atlantic right whales are being exposed to at least two classes of algal-produced environmental neurotoxins-paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and domoic acid (DA). Our primary aims during this six-year study (2001-2006) were to assess whether the whales' exposure to these algal biotoxins occurred annually over multiple years, and to what extent individual whales were exposed repeatedly and/or concurrently to one or both toxin classes. Approximately 140 right whale fecal samples obtained across multiple habitats in the western N. Atlantic were analyzed for PSTs and DA. About 40% of these samples were attributed to individual whales in the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog, permitting analysis of biotoxin exposure according to sex, age class, and reproductive status/history. Our findings demonstrate clearly that right whales are being exposed to both of these algal biotoxins on virtually an annual basis in multiple habitats for periods of up to six months (April through September), with similar exposure rates for females and males (PSTs: ~70-80%; DA: ~25-30%). Notably, only one of 14 lactating females sampled did not contain either PSTs or DA, suggesting the potential for maternal toxin transfer and possible effects on neonatal animals. Moreover, 22% of the fecal samples tested for PSTs and DA showed concurrent exposure to both neurotoxins, leading to questions of interactive effects. Targeted studies employing both in vivo and in vitro model systems represent the next logical step in assessing how and to what extent these algal biotoxins might compromise the health and reproduction of this endangered population. © 2011.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) produce a loud, broadband signal referred to as the gunshot sound. These distinctive sounds may be suitable for passive acoustic monitoring and detection of right whales; however, little is known about the prevalence of these sounds in important right whale habitats, such as the Bay of Fundy. This study investigates the timing and distribution of gunshot sound production on the summer feeding grounds using an array of five marine acoustic recording units deployed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in mid-summer 2004 and 2005. Gunshot sounds were common, detected on 37 of 38 recording days. Stereotyped gunshot bouts averaged 1.5 h, with some bouts exceeding 7 h in duration with up to seven individuals producing gunshots at any one time. Bouts were more commonly detected in the late afternoon and evening than during the morning hours. Locations of gunshots in bouts indicated that whales producing the sounds were either stationary or showed directional travel, suggesting gunshots have different communication functions depending on behavioral context. These results indicate that gunshots are a common right whale sound produced during the summer months and are an important component in the acoustic communication system of this endangered species.},

abstract={Passive acoustic monitoring is being used to detect vocalizing marine mammals. Data on call types and individual rates of sound production are necessary to use passive acoustics to identify species, assess individual detectability, and estimate the number of individuals present. The present study describes the sound production behavior of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, during July and August, recorded with suction cup archival tags (Dtag) in 2000 to 2002 and 2005. The Dtag simultaneously recorded acoustic data from a hydrophone along with the depth and orientation of the whale. Over 168 h of acoustic data were obtained from 46 tag deployments (35 ind.), with an average attachment duration of 4.5 h. The rate of sound production was variable, ranging from 0 to 200 calls h-1 (mean ± SD: 6.4 ± 29.8 calls h-1), with 28 of the 46 tagged whales producing no calls (corresponding to 69/168 h of data). Right whale sounds from any whale in the area were recorded on most tag records, indicating that aggregations of whales may be detected more reliably than individuals. Calling rates were highest during surface activity and traveling and lowest during foraging and logging behavior. Whales of both sexes and all age-classes produced upcalls and other tonal calls, and 1 adult male produced gunshot sounds. The present study provides insight from the largest extant collection of recordings of individual North Atlantic right whales into the acoustic detectability of individual right whales and demonstrates that the behavioral state is the primary factor affecting calling rate. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={We quantified small- and basin-scale variation in the energy available in right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) food, Calanus finmarchicus Copepodite-5 (C5), as a function of depth, tidal variation and circulation during the late-summer feeding period in the Grand Manan Basin of the Bay of Fundy. Food energy density (kJ m-3) is a function of C5 concentration (m-3) and individual C5 lipid energy content (J) that increases by 2 orders of magnitude from near the surface to ~18 kJ m-3 at ~160 m depth; this observation helps explain why right whales concentrate their foraging efforts at depth. Food energy density can vary by a factor of 4 over a tidal cycle and 3.5 over a horizontal distance of ~2 km in the deeper strata of the Basin. By tracing water mass trajectories, we show that it is the warmer, saltier and denser water that contains the highest food energy density that is tidally advected within the Basin. At the scale of the Basin (10s of kilometres) we observed maximum food energy densities of ~25 kJ m-3 in the 140 to 160 m depth stratum where the highest energy densities spatially coincide with the highest historical right whale concentrations. We concluded that the tidal variation and tidally driven circulation represents the simplest explanation for the distribution of food energy density and for the distribution of right whales in the Grand Manan Basin region and that Basin topography and water mass excursions associated with tidal currents facilitate the persistence of C5 aggregations in the dense deep water. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={Commercial fishing gear can potentially entangle any whale, and this is especially true for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), for which entanglement is second only to vessel strike as being responsible for documented right whale deaths. We use right whale survey data and Canadian fishing-gear deployment data to estimate the relative threat of gear entanglement in a Scotia-Fundy study area and the relative risk of lethal entanglement in the Bay of Fundy and on Roseway Basin, Scotian Shelf, where Critical Habitat has been legislated. We focus on groundfish and pelagic hook-and-line; groundfish gillnet; and crab-, hagfish-, and inshore and offshore lobster-trap gear. Our analyses demonstrate that groundfish hook-and-line gear poses the greatest threat to right whales among the seven gear types analysed during the summer-resident period in Critical Habitat and that gear from the lobster fisheries poses the greatest threat during the spring and autumn periods when whales are migrating to and from Critical Habitat. We suggest that area-specific seasonal closures of some fisheries would reduce threat and risk to whales without unduly compromising fishing interests.},

We used Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to evaluate and compare the compliance rates between the mandatory and voluntary measures to protect right whales in the southeast US critical habitat area off Florida and Georgia during the winters from 2005-06 to 2008-09. Vessel compliance was significantly higher under mandatory versus voluntary recommended speed restrictions, with compliance rates of 75 and 16%, respectively. Average vessel speeds were slower under mandatory speed restrictions (10.5 knots, 19.6 km h -1) compared to voluntary recommended speed restrictions (14.5 knots, 26.9 km h -1). Although vessels only slow down when mandated, they change their routing voluntarily. Compliance rates with voluntary recommended routes steadily increased during this period, from 43% prior to rulemaking, to 52% during the first year, 84% in the second year, and 96% in the final year of the study. Combining reduced speeds with recommended routes reduces the probability of right whale mortality from ships by 71.9% from the pre-implementation period. These results support long-term implementation of both vessel-speed reduction and restricted vessel routes for the survival and recovery of the North Atlantic right whale. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={The high variability in reproductive performance of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis compared to southern right whales Eubalaena australis may reflect differences in lipid reserves. Amplitude-mode ultrasound was used to measure the thickness of right whale integument (epidermis and blubber, herein referred to as blubber thickness) in E. glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada for 5 summer seasons and in E. australis off the South African coast for 2 austral winter seasons. E. glacialis had significantly thinner blubber layers (mean ±1 SD = 12.23 ± 2.16 cm, n = 172) than E. australis (16.13 ± 3.88 cm, n = 117), suggesting differing levels of nutrition between the 2 species. Blubber was thickest in females measured 3 to 6 mo prior to the start of pregnancy (E. glacialis), thinner during lactation (E. glacialis, E. australis) and then thicker with time after weaning (E. glacialis). These results suggest that lipids in blubber are used as energetic support for reproduction in female right whales. Blubber thickness increased in calves during suckling (E. glacialis, E. australis) but sub - sequently decreased after weaning (E. glacialis). Juvenile and adult male E. glacialis blubber thicknesses were compared between years of differing prey Calanus finmarchicus abundances (data from Pershing et al. 2005; ICES J Mar Sci 62:1511-1523); during a year of low prey abundance whales had significantly thinner blubber than during years of greater prey abundance. Taken together, these results suggest that blubber thickness is indicative of right whale energy balance and that the marked fluctuations in North Atlantic right whale reproduction have a nutritional component. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={To assess the spectral sensitivities of the retinal visual pigments from the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), we have cloned and sequenced two exons from the rod opsin gene and two exons from the middle-wavelength sensitive (MWS) cone opsin gene in order to determine the amino acids at positions known to be key regulators of the spectral location of the absorbance maximum (λ max). Based on previous mutagenesis models we estimate that the right whale possesses a rod visual pigment with a λ max of 499 nm and a MWS cone visual pigment with a λ max of 524 nm. Although the MWS cone visual pigment from the right whale is blue-shifted in its spectral sensitivity like those from odontocetes, the spectral sensitivity of the right whale rod visual pigment is similar to those from terrestrial mammals. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Mainland Portugal is not renowned for having been a whaling nation of significance. However, preliminary studies have brought to light enough historical references to suggest that whaling occurred from at least the 13th century, and the present work identifies 38 historical sources documenting whale use or whaling on the Portuguese coast between 1201 and 1728. A peak of whale-related sources occurred during the 13th and 14th centuries, and almost all Portuguese accounts are contemporary to those found from the French and Spanish Basque countries, such that the beginning of the whaling activity seems to be coeval. No geographical cluster of whaling activities can be established-they seem to have been unevenly scattered along the entire coastline. Nor can a chronological north-south movement of coastal whaling activities be discerned. The geographical and chronological patterns give support to the assumption that whaling was not introduced to Portugal by the Basques, who are known to have spread westward from the French Labourd (11th century), via Golf of Biscay, to Asturias, and southward to Galicia (14th century). Rather, Portuguese whale use seems to have originated independently of Basque influence. Several of the sources specify "black whales" as the target species. This is consistent with modern knowledge about the distribution and migration patterns of North Atlantic right whales during Basque medieval and early modern whaling. The Portuguese sources are not clear as to numbers of whales taken, nor to the whaling technology used, but the activity was sufficiently well organized and developed to warrant the levying of tithes in the feudal system of 13th-century Portugal. © ISAZ 2011.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were found in an important nineteenth century whaling area east of southern Greenland, from which they were once thought to have been extirpated. In 2007-2008, a 1-year passive acoustic survey was conducted at five sites in and near the 'Cape Farewell Ground', the former whaling ground. Over 2000 right whale calls were recorded at these sites, primarily during July- November. Most calls were northwest of the historic ground, suggesting a broader range in this region than previously known. Geographical and temporal separation of calls confirms use of this area by multiple animals. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Passive acoustic monitoring allows the assessment of marine mammal occurrence and distribution at greater temporal and spatial scales than is now possible with traditional visual surveys. However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={This paper examines key factors used in protecting the migratory North Atlantic right whale within the context of a marine protected area (MPA) system, using the Grand Manan Whale Conservation Area, in New Brunswick Canada, as a case study example. Designated as a conservation area in 1993, before the Oceans Act came into effect, the Grand Manan conservation area currently does not form part of the Canadian network of MPAs. Given the possibility that MPA designation may occur, the paper examines factors that should be considered in meeting International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) MPA design criteria and IUCN evaluation model requirements. An MPA evaluation framework based on an IUCN evaluation model (Hockings et al., 2000 [1]) is designed to assess the effectiveness of an MPA in protecting a migratory right whale. Case study results indicate that current management and research activities for the Grand Manan conservation area address most governance, biophysical and socio-economic issues under an IUCN evaluation framework. On a site basis, it is recommended that the Grand Manan conservation area be designated as a component of the Canadian network of MPAs and that regulations be developed and implemented under the Species at Risk Act to clearly define activities considered damaging or destructive to right whale critical habitat. Recommendations also suggest the preparation of a combined site management-action plan for the Grand Manan conservation area indicating how activities specified in North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Strategy will be implemented locally. On a regional and international basis, recommendations call for an internationally coordinated and integrated approach to right whale protection within the context of a network of designated critical habitat areas. Recommended activities include: continued Canadian participation in cross-border research and actions to mitigate threats to the right whales over their migratory range; development of a regional right whale management and monitoring strategy; and designation of additional critical habitats in national/international waters. It is further recommended that the evaluation framework developed by this paper be used as a model in assessing the conservation and management effectiveness of MPAs protecting other migratory marine species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The ability to modify vocalizations to compensate for environmental noise is critical for successful communication in a dynamic acoustic environment. Many marine species rely on sound for vital life functions including communication, navigation and feeding. The impacts of significant increases in ocean noise levels from human activities are a current area of concern for the conservation of marine mammals. Here, we document changes in calling behaviour by individual endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in increased background noise. Right whales, like several bird and primate species, respond to periods of increased noise by increasing the amplitude of their calls. This behaviour may help maintain the communication range with conspecifics during periods of increased noise. These call modifications have implications for conservation efforts for right whales, affecting both the way whales use sound to communicate and our ability to detect them with passive acoustic monitoring systems.

abstract={Diel vertical migration (DVM) by herbivorous copepods likely has a profound effect on the behavior and ecology of copepod predators. We characterized the DVM behavior of late-stage Calanus finmarchicus in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2005 to 2007, and investigated the influence of this behavior on the occurrence of zooplanktivorous baleen whales. On 5 occasions, we occupied an oceanographic station for 1 to 2 d and conducted (1) a half-hourly census of whales and (2) a half-hourly cast with an instrument package measuring temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and copepod abundance. We observed significant variability in DVM behavior both within and among years that was unrelated to stratification or chlorophyll concentration. Instead, DVM appeared to be influenced by the vertical distribution of phytoplankton, the presence of visual predators (sand lance Ammodytes spp.), copepod developmental stage, and the feeding history of individual copepods. Migrating copepods had oil sacs that were 44% larger than non-migrating copepods at the surface after accounting for developmental stage, which suggests that well-fed copepods are more likely to vertically migrate. While the occurrence of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis was unrelated to variability in the migration behavior of C. finmarchicus, sei whales Balaenoptera borealis were significantly less abundant during times of strong DVM behavior. We speculate that right whales do not compete directly with sand lance and herring for C. finmarchicus, but by inducing DVM behavior, these fish are likely influencing the distribution and abundance of sei whales in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were absent from Roseway Basin, located off southeastern Nova Scotia, for a 7-year period (1993-1999). The objective of this study was to examine the availability of the right whale's main prey, Calanus finmarchicus, in Roseway Basin during those 7 years to determine if the whales' absence was due to inadequate prey resources. Since we had no historical data on zooplankton abundances at depth on the Scotian Shelf, near-surface zooplankton abundance data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder were used to infer water-column abundances. In addition, environmental parameters that are often correlated with high zooplankton concentrations were examined. The hypotheses tested were that changes in these parameters would be detectable between three time periods: pre-1993, 1993-1999 and post-1999. Calanus finmarchicus abundance was found to be lowest during 1993-1999, suggesting that right whales were not foraging in Roseway Basin because of the near-absence of their main prey species. Decreased in situ salinity and density proved to be indicators of the changes in circulation in the 1990s that may have affected the advection of C. finmarchicus onto the Scotian Shelf. © The Author 2010.

abstract={Abstract: North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, remain endangered, primarily due to excessive anthropogenic mortality. Current management protocols in US waters are triggered by identifying the presence of at least one right whale in a management area. We assessed whether acoustic detection of right whale contact calls can work as an alternative to visual aerial surveys for establishing their presence. Aerial survey and acoustic monitoring were conducted in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, in 2001-2005 and used to evaluate and compare right whale detections. Over the 58 d with simultaneous aerial and acoustic coverage, aerial surveys saw whales on approximately two-thirds of the days during which acoustic monitoring heard whales. There was no strong relationship between numbers of whales seen during aerial surveys and numbers of contact calls detected on survey days. Results indicate acoustic monitoring is a more reliable mechanism than aerial survey for detecting right whales. Because simple detection is sufficient to trigger current management protocols, continuous, autonomous acoustic monitoring provides information of immediate management utility more reliably than aerial surveillance. Aerial surveys are still required to provide data for estimating population parameters and for visually assessing the frequency and severity of injuries from shipping and fishing and detecting injured and entangled right whales. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Abstract: During the 1990s, North Atlantic right whales had significantly decreased reproduction and showed signs of compromised health, prompting the initiation of noninvasive fecal-based studies to investigate potential causal factors. The interpretation of these studies is enhanced when the defecator is identified, as data can then be linked to individual life history information. Fecal samples (n= 118) were either collected from single photoidentified whales, associated with several individuals by photoidentification of whales in the vicinity upon sample collection, or were collected when no whales were in the vicinity. Genetic profiles from fecal DNA comprising sex, mitochondrial haplotype, and five microsatellite loci helped assign specific samples to individual right whales based on existing genetic profiles. Profiles were informative in assigning 61 fecal samples to known individuals, 24 of which were collected when no whales were in the vicinity. Whales identified genetically were typically photographed in the same habitat area and on the same day of sample collection (n= 35/48). Twelve profiles new to the genetic database were identified, suggesting fecal sampling provides a means to obtain genetic profiles from previously unsampled individuals, which may help refine estimates of population size and habitat use patterns if annual fecal sampling continues. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Abstract: Like most mysticetes, North Atlantic right whale cows generally separate from their calves on their feeding grounds within a year. Right whale life history data from 1993 to 2005 were analyzed to determine the duration of cow/calf associations and where the pair separated. A change occurred with the 2001 cows; 71% of those available stayed with their calves into the second year and this behavior remained elevated for several years. Less experienced cows, independent of their age, were more likely to extend their associations. The occurrence of cow/yearling associations was not related to the length of the cow's previous interbirth interval, used as a proxy for cow condition, but the hypothesis that body condition impacts how long cows nurse their young could not be adequately tested. Seventy-seven percent of the observed cow/yearling pairs also returned to the calving ground, a substantial physiological investment given the 1,450 km plus migration and the fact that they fast there, indicating that factors other than nutrition also influenced the cow's behavior. The concurrent increase in juveniles in the shallow waters of the winter calving grounds may afford naive whales greater protection from predators or provide a social benefit that improves their overall fitness. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={All endangered large whale species are vulnerable to collisions with large ships; and "ship strikes" are the greatest known threat to one of the world's rarest whales, the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The magnitude of this threat is likely to increase as maritime commerce expands. Factors influencing the incidence and severity of ship strikes are not well understood, although vessel speed appears to be a strong contributor. The purpose of this study was to characterize the hydrodynamic effects near a moving hull that may cause a whale to be drawn to or repelled from the hull, and to assess the accelerations exerted on a whale at the time of impact. Using scale models of a container ship and a right whale in experimental flow tanks, we assessed hydrodynamic effects and measured accelerations experienced by the whale model in the presence of a moving vessel. Accelerations at impact were measured while the whale was at the surface, for various vessel speeds, orientations of the whale relative to the vessel path, and distances off the direct path of the vessel. Accelerations experienced by the whale model in a collision: increased in magnitude with increasing ship speed; were not dependent on whale orientation to the vessel path; and decreased exponentially with increasing separation distances from the ship track. Subsequent experiments with the whale model submerged at one to two times the ship's draft indicated a pronounced propeller suction effect, a drawing of the whale toward the hull, and increased probability of propeller strikes resulting from this class of encounter. Measured accelerations are a proxy for impact severity, but do not constitute a detailed study of injury mechanism in a living animal, though they may help inform future work. We present a heuristic map of the hydrodynamic field around a transiting hull likely involved in close whale/vessel encounters. These results may have bearing on policy decisions, particularly those involving vessel speed, aimed at protecting large whales from ship strikes worldwide. © 2010.},

abstract={Various brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and current-use, non-PBDE BFRs, as well as organochlorine (OC) pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were measured in winter flounder, harp and hooded seals, and North Atlantic right whales from the Eastern United States and Canada. The concentrations of PBDEs in winter flounder and right whales were similar in magnitude to the levels of PCBs, which was unlike the pattern observed in seals. In these marine mammals, the levels of PBDEs were orders of magnitude lower than the levels of OCs and PCBs detected. Evidence existed for the accumulation of methoxylated (MeO)-PBDEs of natural origin in seals and right whales. Current-use, non-PBDE BFRs (including hexabromocyclododecane, pentabromoethylbenzene, hexabromobenzene, and pentabromotoluene) were detected in winter flounder and marine mammals. Future research should focus on monitoring PBDEs, current-use, non-PBDE BFRs, and MeO-BDEs of natural origin in marine organisms from Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper compares three different approaches currently used in recognizing contact calls made from the North Atlantic Right Whale (NRW), Eubalaena glacialis. We present two new approaches consisting of machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NET) and the classification and regression tree classifiers (CART), and compare their performance with earlier work that employs multi-Stage feature vector testing (FVT) approach. A combined total of over 100,000 noise and NRW up-call events were used in the study. Calls were primarily recorded from two areas, Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Of the three classifiers, the CART had the highest assignment rates, overall 86.45% with highest false positive rates (<100 per hour). The FVT Method had exceptionally low false positive rates, with <50 per hour. However, it had an overall assignment rate less than the NET. The CART had statistically the same false positive rate as the NET with the highest assignment rates, 2.2% higher than the NET and 11.75% greater than the FVT Method. Details of the results are shown and extensions to the research are discussed. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous signal detection of the North Atlantic right whale (NRW), Eubalaena glacialis, is becoming an important factor in monitoring and conservation for this highly endangered species. Both online and offline systems exist to help study and protect animals within this population. In both cases auto-detection of species-specific calls plays a vital role in localizing individual animal by searching time-frequency passive acoustic data. This research presents an experimental system, referred to as the NRW-CRITIC, for automatic detection of the NRW contact call. In general, the CRITIC uses a combinatorial classifier approach to integrate a series of existing machine learning algorithms; each designed specifically for NRW contact call identification. The proposed configuration consists of several recognition methods running in parallel; these include linear discriminant analysis, artificial neural network (NET) and classification regression tree (CART). This paper presents the details for the NRW-CRITIC and discusses the approach used to combine multiple independent decisions into a single result. A side-by-side performance comparison, between the CRITIC and a well-known method, the feature vector testing (FVT), is summarized. Performance metrics are evaluated based on a large database of acoustic recordings consisting of over 58,000 NRW contact calls from various locations, including two critical habitats, Great South Channel and Cape Cod Bay. Results indicate the FVT algorithm yields a74.7% detection probability with an error rate of 4.35%. In comparison the CRITIC, operating at similar information level yields a 78.02% detection probability with a 3.25% error rate, exceeding the performance of the FVT. Performance was also measured using data from a multi-channel acoustic array located in Massachusetts Bay. A side-by-side comparison of array presence is discussed for two separate days. Results show that with the FVT and CRITIC operating at 0% error for array presence, the FVT method had 18,769 and 24,469 false positives for the Massachusetts Bay dataseis respectively. With the same 0% error condition the CRITIC provided successful detection with significantly lower number of false positive rates: 1,072 and 2,324 calls, respectively. Future extensions of this experimental work are also discussed. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Reduced reproductive success has contributed to lack of recovery of the endangered western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Here we examined the specific life history period from just before birth through the first year to estimate calf and perinatal losses between 1989 and 2003. The lower bound estimate (17 mortalities from 208 calving events) included documented calf mortalities and presumed deaths from serious injury or disappearance from the sighting record. The upper bound estimated potential calf losses from females with delayed first parturition (>10 yr) and shortened (2 yr) or lengthened (≥4 yr) calving intervals, if the female migrated to the calving ground during these intervals. Because cows were sighted in the calving ground predominantly in years when they were available to calve, adult females sighted there in a possible calving year without a calf were assumed to have experienced a perinatal loss. Twenty-eight potential perinatal losses were detected, bringing the upper bound of calf and perinatal mortality to 45 (3.0 calves/yr). The high frequency of lengthened calving intervals in E. glacialis suggests that abortion and neonatal losses are contributing to lower reproductive success compared to Southern Hemisphere right whales (Eubalaena australis). © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Baleen whales have among the lowest reproductive rates in the animal kingdom, coupled with high energetic demands on lactating mothers to support the rapid growth of their offspring. Because each offspring represents a large portion of a female's reproductive effort, strong selection pressure should be in place to minimize the potential for misplaced parental effort. However, we describe a case in which two North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) offspring were switched between mothers and remained with their "adopted" mothers throughout their first year of life (until they were weaned). The most reasonable explanation is that this swap was an accident caused by the females calving in close spatial and temporal proximity. The calves likely associated with the wrong mothers before any mother-offspring recognition system had developed, and an association then formed between these non-biological mother-offspring pairs. These data raise intriguing questions regarding how often this may occur in other wildlife populations, what mechanisms are used for mother-offspring recognition in whales, and how long it takes for this recognition to develop.},

abstract={Background: The objective of this study was to enhance removal of fishing gear from right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) at sea that evade disentanglement boat approaches. Titrated intra muscular injections to achieve sedation were undertaken on two free swimming right whales. Methodology/Principal Findings: Following initial trials with beached whales, a sedation protocol was developed for right whales. Mass was estimated from sighting and necropsy data from comparable right whales. Midazolam (0.01 to 0.025 mg/ kg) was first given alone or with meperidine (0.17 to 0.25 mg/kg) either once or four times over two hours to whale #1102 by cantilevered pole syringe. In the last attempt on whale #1102 there appeared to be a mild effect in 20-30 minutes, with duration of less than 2 hours that included exhalation before the blowhole fully cleared the water. Boat avoidance, used as a measure of sedation depth, was not reduced. A second severely entangled animal in 2009, whale #3311, received midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) followed by butorphanol (0.03 mg/kg) an hour later, delivered ballistically. Two months later it was then given midazolam (0.07 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.07 mg/kg) simultaneously. The next day both drugs at 0.1 mg/kg were given as a mixture in two darts 10 minutes apart. The first attempt on whale #3311 showed increased swimming speed and boat avoidance was observed after a further 20 minutes. The second attempt on whale #3311 showed respiration increasing mildly in frequency and decreasing in strength. The third attempt on whale #3311 gave a statistically significant increase in respiratory frequency an hour after injection, with increased swimming speed and marked reduction of boat evasion that enabled decisive cuts to entangling gear. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that butorphanol and midazolam delivered ballistically in appropriate dosages and combinations may have merit in future refractory free swimming entangled right whale cases until other entanglement solutions are developed.},

abstract={Mitochondrial heteroplasmy has been identified in a variety of species and can result from either paternal leakage, whereby sperm mitochondria enter the ova during fertilization, or more commonly by the "survival" and proliferation of mutant variants within an organism. From an evolutionary perspective, this process represents the generation of new mitochondrial diversity within a species. Although this has been documented in some mammalian species, it has been reported from relatively few wild mammalian populations and in no wild nonhuman population has the transfer and segregation of mitochondrial heteroplasmy been tracked through multiple generations. We report on the first case of the identification and tracking of mitochondrial control region heteroplasmy through 3 generations in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis. We also identify the full segregation to the mutant variant within a single generation and thus the development of a new haplotype (haplotype G) in a maternal lineage of this endangered species. Witnessed here is the generation of mitochondrial diversity in a genetically depauperate species. © 2009 The American Genetic Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Fishing gear is known to be a threat to North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), and groundlines used in the American lobster (Homarus americanus) trap fishery are hypothesized to be an integral component of entanglements that may, in some incidents, lead to mortality. This research measured the elevations above the seabed of 17 regular groundlines on commercially active lobster gear in the Bay of Fundy and evaluated several factors governing rope elevation profiles. Mean elevation was 1.6 m (s.d. = 0.9, n = 5968, range = 0.0-7.0 m). The hypothesis that groundline elevations were ≤1.0 m (predicted height of taut groundlines) was rejected (Fisher's C = 66.9, p &lt; 0.01), as was the hypothesis that elevations were &gt;3.0 m (approximate body height of a right whale; Fisher's C = 129.5, p &lt; 0.01). The proportion of groundline elevations ≤1.0 m was 0.32, and that &lt;3.0 m was 0.92. Groundline elevations were negatively related to tidal current velocity at the time of setting (p &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.33) and were closer to the seabed in deep than in shallow water (p &lt; 0.05, r2 = 0.07). It is suggested that groundlines in the Bay of Fundy may not constitute a large part of the risk associated with the entanglement of right whales, because most lines remained below the elevation hypothesized to be a threat (3 m). We also identified factors within the control of fishers setting trawls that minimize groundline elevations. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.

abstract={Low levels of genetic variability identified within the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), when compared to the Southern right whale (E. australis) and other large whales, have been suggested to result from population reductions due to whaling. Previous genetic analysis of 218 whale bones from sixteenth century Basque whaling sites in the western North Atlantic revealed only a single right whale bone. We determined the genotypes of 27 microsatellite loci using DNA isolated from this bone. All alleles from the historic specimen occur in the extant western North Atlantic population and both the probability of identity of the specimen and the number of heterozygous loci are similar to that in the extant population. Assessments of how genetically different the historical population might have been suggest genetic characteristics have not changed substantially over four centuries of whaling. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={The marine algal biotoxin, domoic acid (DA), is produced by certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. This neurotoxin has been responsible for several mass mortality events involving marine birds and mammals. In all cases, the toxin was transferred from its algal producers through marine food webs by one or more intermediate vectors. The ability of some copepod taxa to serve as vectors for DA has been demonstrated; however, the role played in DA trophic transfer by Calanus finmarchicus, which often dominates N. Atlantic zooplankton assemblages and is a primary dietary component of the highly endangered N. Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), has been uncertain. In the present study, we examined the ability of C. finmarchicus to consume DA-producing algae and retain the toxin. Results of grazing and toxin accumulation/depuration experiments showed that C. finmarchicus consumed DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries regardless of the presence or absence of morphologically similar, but non-toxic, P. pungens, across initial cell concentrations ranging from 1000-4000 cells mL- 1. Furthermore, C. finmarchicus did not appear to preferentially consume or avoid either Pseudo-nitzschia species tested. After ingestion of P. multiseries, copepods accumulated DA and retained it for up to 48 h post-removal of the toxin source. These findings provide evidence for the potential of C. finmarchicus to facilitate DA trophic transfer in marine food webs where toxic Pseudo-nitzschia is present.},

abstract={Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) lunge at high speed with mouth open to nearly 90 degrees to engulf large volumes of prey-laden water. This feeding process is enabled by extremely large skulls and mandibles that increase mouth area, thereby facilitating the flux of water into the mouth. When these mandibles are lowered during lunge-feeding, they are exposed to high drag, and therefore, may be subject to significant bending forces. We hypothesized that these mandibles exhibited a mechanical design (shape and density distribution) that enables these bones to accommodate high loads during lunge-feeding without exceeding their breaking strength. We used quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to determine the three-dimensional geometry and density distribution of a pair of subadult humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mandibles (length = 2.10 m). QCT data indicated highest bone density and cross-sectional area, and therefore, high resistance to bending and deflection, from the coronoid process to the middle of the dentary, which then decreased towards the anterior end of the mandible. These results differ from the caudorostral trends of increasing mandibular bone density in mammals, such as humans and the right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, indicating that adaptive bone remodeling is a significant contributing factor in establishing mandibular bone density distributions in rorquals. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis is one of the most endangered species of large whales. Although human-caused mortality is the primary factor contributing to poor recovery of E. glacialis, variability in reproductive success may also play a role. The present study evaluates the idea that seasonal distributions and reproductive success in E. glacialis are linked to food availability or related environmental conditions that can be assessed by treating satellite-derived sea-surface chlorophyll (chl) concentration as a proxy. Sea-surface chl time series in the major high-use feeding habitats and whale-sightings data were compared. Whale transition between habitats reflects a pattern in the seasonal distribution of peak concentration in satellite-derived chl. A regionally and seasonally weighted chl index was calculated to reflect aspects of average potential food condition. We found a significant correlation between the number of whale calves born and the weighted chl averaged over the prior 2 yr. These findings are consistent with the view that food availability during and just before the gestation period may be a critical factor regulating reproductive success, with low food years contributing to delays in conception. Longer time series are necessary to examine the predictive relationship between weighted chl concentration and calf production. Although ecological interactions and whale reproductive biology are certainly more complex than can be encompassed by emphasizing only food availability, analysis of satellite-derived surface chl concentrations provides a practical means to monitor a level of ecosystem variability that affects right-whale distributions and productivity. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={In addition to ship collisions and fishing gear entanglements, recovery of the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis has been challenged by reproductive abnormalities and compromised health. Of the factors hypothesized as contributing to the observed reproductive dysfunction in right whales, exposure to marine biotoxins such as domoic acid (DA) has received comparatively little consideration. The present study assessed the occurrence of DA in right whale feces, copepods, and krill collected from April through September of 2005 and 2006 on the whales' feeding grounds along the northeastern USA and eastern Canada. DA was detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in 69 right whale fecal samples, 6 krill samples, and 32 copepod samples. Many of the latter were dominated largely by Stage V Calanus finmarchicus copepodites. DA detection by SPR in fecal and zooplankton collections was verified by receptor binding assay and confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Moreover, LC-MS/MS determined the presence of a putative methylated DA metabolite in all fecal and zooplankton samples analyzed. Frustules of several potentially toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were identified in whale feces and phytoplankton samples by light and electron microscopy. Electron microscopy also revealed an abundance of C. finmarchicus mandibles in right whale feces. These findings confirm that E. glacialis was exposed to DA for several months, likely through ingestion of a DA-contaminated copepod vector. The extent to which this algal biotoxin may contribute to the failed recovery of the E. glacialis population warrants further investigation. © Inter-Research 2010 · www.int-res.com.},

abstract={Acoustic masking from anthropogenic noise is increasingly being considered as a threat to marine mammals, particularly low-frequency specialists such as baleen whales. Low-frequency ocean noise has increased in recent decades, often in habitats with seasonally resident populations of marine mammals, raising concerns that noise chronically influences life histories of individuals and populations. In contrast to physical harm from intense anthropogenic sources, which can have acute impacts on individuals, masking from chronic noise sources has been difficult to quantify at individual or population levels, and resulting effects have been even more difficult to assess. This paper presents an analytical paradigm to quantify changes in an animal's acoustic communication space as a result of spatial, spectral, and temporal changes in background noise, providing a functional definition of communication masking for free-ranging animals and a metric to quantify the potential for communication masking. We use the sonar equation, a combination of modeling and analytical techniques, and measurements from empirical data to calculate time-varying spatial maps of potential communication space for singing fin (Balaenoptera physalus), singing humpback (Megoptera novaeangliae), and calling right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales. These illustrate how the measured loss of communication space as a result of differing levels of noise is converted into a time-varying measure of communication masking. The proposed paradigm and mechanisms for measuring levels of communication masking can be applied to different species, contexts, acoustic habitats and ocean noise scenes to estimate the potential impacts of masking at the individual and population levels. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={Successful mitigation of vessel-whale encounters requires quantitative estimates of vessel strikes, how strike rates change over time, where strikes are most likely to occur, and options for minimizing strikes. In addressing these issues, we first demonstrate a 3-to 4-fold increase in the number of reported large whale-vessel strikes worldwide from the early 1970s to the early 2000s, corresponding to a 3-fold increase in the number of vessels in the world fleet that is paralleled by an increase in vessel tonnage and speed. Second, we estimate a 50% chance of 14 or more annual vessel-strike reports worldwide between 1999 and 2002. For North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, we estimate a 60% chance of observing at least 1 right whale death from vessel strike. Adjusting for undetermined causes of death and unobserved deaths, we estimate a 10-fold increase (from 1 to 10) in the expected annual number of fatal ship strikes. Third, we evaluate the eastern United States geographic distribution of right whales and vessels to calculate relative probabilities of vessel-whale encounters among 3 major right whale habitats. We determine that the Southern Calving Ground poses the greatest threat of a vessel strike: 1.6-and 7-fold greater than in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel, respectively. Finally, for the Great South Channel region we present a quantitatively determined vessel-traffic routing option that would achieve a 39% reduction in vessel-whale encounter probabilities. The methods employed in assessing encounter probabilities and vessel-routing options can be applied elsewhere to enhance the conservation of endangered and threatened species that suffer vessel-strike mortality. © Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract={Ocean-going vessels pose a threat to large whales worldwide and are responsible for the majority of reported deaths diagnosed among endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). Various conservation policies have been implemented to reduce vessel-strike mortality in this species. The International Maritime Organization adopted the Roseway Basin Area to be avoided on the Scotian Shelf as a voluntary conservation initiative to reduce the risk of lethal vessel strikes to right whales. We initiated the Vessel Avoidance & Conservation Area Transit Experiment to evaluate the efficacy of this initiative because the effectiveness of the avoidance scheme in reducing risk without the imposition of vessel-speed restrictions depends entirely on vessel-operator compliance. Using a network of automatic identification system receivers, we collected static, dynamic, and voyage-related vessel data in near real time from the Roseway Basin region for 12 months before and 6 months after the implementation of the area to be avoided. Using pre- and post-implementation vessel navigation and speed data, along with right whale sightings per unit effort data, all resolved at 3′N latitude by 3′W longitude, we estimated the post-implementation change in risk of lethal vessel strikes. Estimates of vessel-operator voluntary compliance ranged from 57% to 87% and stabilized at 71% within the first 5 months of implementation. Our estimates showed an 82% reduction in the risk of lethal vessel strikes to right whales due to vessel-operator compliance. We conclude that the high level of compliance achieved with this voluntary conservation initiative occurred because the area to be avoided was adopted by the International Maritime Organization. Our results demonstrate that international shipping interests are able and willing to voluntarily alter course to protect endangered whales. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={This chapter examines the characteristics, distribution, and behavior and conservation status of the right whale. There has been disagreement on two questions of balaenid systematics and nomenclature-concerning the number of extant species of right whales and whether or not bowhead whales and right whales are congeneric. They have an extremely robust body form, bordering on rotund, with thick blubber layer and the girth at times exceeding 60% of total body length. The body is mostly black, sometimes with irregular white ventral patches. Right whales are found in the middle latitudes of both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres. There are three geographically isolated populations currently recognized as separate species: in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern oceans. Right whales feed entirely on zooplankton, especially on large calanoid copepods. At times they also feed on smaller copepods, krill (larger shrimp-like crustaceans), pteropods (tiny planktonic snails), or the planktonic larval stages of barnacles and other crustaceans. They migrate annually between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude calving and breeding grounds. Calving in right whales occurs during winter. Where the calving grounds are known, they are in shallow coastal regions or bays. The only known current calving ground in the western North Atlantic is in coastal waters near Georgia and northeastern Florida. Right whales are observed to frequently perform highly energetic behaviors at or above the surface of the water. These aerial behaviors include breaching, lobtailing, and flippering. North Atlantic right whales were the first whales to be harvested commercially by the Basques along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe as early as the eleventh century. The whales were killed primarily for oil, which was sold across Europe, as the technology of the time did not permit preservation and widespread transportation of meat. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Demography is the study of the population consequences of the fates of individuals. Individuals are differentiated on the basis of age or, in general, life cycle stages. The movement of an individual through its life cycle is a random process, and although the eventual destination (death) is certain, the pathways taken to that destination are stochastic and will differ even between identical individuals; this is individual stochasticity. A stage-classified demographic model contains implicit age-specific information, which can be analyzed using Markov chain methods. The living stages in the life cycles are transient states in an absorbing Markov chain; death is an absorbing state. This paper presents Markov chain methods for computing the mean and variance of the lifetime number of visits to any transient state, the mean and variance of longevity, the net reproductive rate R0, and the cohort generation time. It presents the matrix calculus methods needed to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of all these indices to any life history parameters. These sensitivities have many uses, including calculation of selection gradients. It is shown that the use of R0 as a measure of fitness or an invasion exponent gives erroneous results except when R0=λ= 1. The Markov chain approach is then generalized to variable environments (deterministic environmental sequences, periodic environments, iid random environments, Markovian environments). Variable environments are analyzed using the vec-permutation method to create a model that classifies individuals jointly by the stage and environmental condition. Throughout, examples are presented using the North Atlantic right whale (Eubaleana glacialis) and an endangered prairie plant (Lomatium bradshawii) in a stochastic fire environment. © 2009 Oikos.},

abstract={Defining the appropriate scale over which to conduct a study in the marine environment is critical to achieving appropriate scientific, management, mitigation and conservation objectives. This paper focuses on applications of passive acoustic technologies over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is divided into sections dealing with archival and real-time passive acoustic sensor applications. Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={Humans and cetaceans are exposed to a wide range of contaminants. In this study, we compared the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of a metal pollutant, hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], which has been shown to cause damage in lung cells from both humans and North Atlantic right whales. Our results show that Cr induces increased cell death and chromosome damage in lung cells from both species with increasing intracellular Cr ion levels. Soluble Cr(VI) induced less of a cytotoxic and genotoxic effect based on administered dose in right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) cells than in human (Homo sapiens) cells. Whereas, particulate Cr(VI) induced a similar cytotoxic effect but less of a genotoxic effect based on administered dose in right whale cells than in human cells. Differences in chromium ion uptake explained soluble chromate-induced cell death but not all of the soluble chromate-induced chromosome damage. Uptake differences of lead ions could explain the differences in particulate chromate-induced toxicity. The data show that both forms of Cr(VI) are less genotoxic to right whale than human lung cells, and that soluble Cr(VI) induces a similar cytotoxic effect in both right whale and human cells, while particulate Cr(VI) is more cytotoxic to right whale lung cells. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Many long-term studies of wildlife populations rely on individual identification based on natural markings or genetic profiling, or both. However, only rarely are these 2 independent data sets systematically compared with each other to estimate the error rates inherent in these studies. Here, >25 years of photo-identification data on the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) were compared with high-resolution genetic profiles, available for >75% of the individuals in the photo-identification catalog, in order to identify sources and rates of errors associated with both methods of individual identification. The resulting estimates were 0.0308 errors/identification for the photo-identification data, and 0.00121 errors/locus and 0.0327 errors/multilocus profile for the genetic data. These are among the lowest error rates yet reported, and indicate that the approaches used provide reliable means of individual identification for this species. However, despite these low error rates, the large size of the data sets results in a nonnegligible estimated number of errors, indicating that the potential for these errors needs to be incorporated into other analyses that are based on these data. A similar situation likely exists in other long-term studies where, although error rates are assumed to be low, the size of the data set results in a large number of errors that will influence subsequent analyses. Regularly conducting and reporting extensive database comparisons such as this is invaluable for maintaining the integrity of long-term data sets by identifying where sources of error are occurring and how protocols can be improved to lower error rates in the future. © 2009 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract={The feasibility of using analysis of hormone content of whale blow samples to assess reproductive function is addressed. A suitable collection method and analytical technique using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed. Blow samples were collected opportunistically from free-ranging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 35) and North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (n = 18) using a 13-m carbon fiber pole with a collection device. Samples were analyzed for the presence of testosterone and progesterone using a 55% isocratic gradient with LC-MS. Testosterone was detected in four humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. Progesterone was detected in seven humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. This is the first documented use of lung mucosa to determine the presence of reproductive hormones in any free-swimming cetacean and may provide a novel non-invasive technique to quantify the hormonal condition of free-swimming animals that spend brief periods of time at the water's surface. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={In an effort to better understand the mechanics of ship-whale collision and to reduce the associated mortality of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a comprehensive biomechanical study has been conducted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of New Hampshire. The goal of the study is to develop a numerical modeling tool to predict the forces and stresses during impact and thereby the resulting mortality risk to whales from ship strikes. Based on post-mortem examinations, jaw fracture was chosen as a fatal endpoint for the whales hit by a vessel. In this paper we investigate the overall mechanical behavior of a right whale mandible under transverse loading and develop a finite element analysis model of the bone. The equivalent elastic modulus of the cortical component of right whale mandible is found by comparing full-scale bending tests with the results of numerical modeling. The finite element model of the mandible can be used in conjunction with a vessel-whale collision event model to predict bone fracture for various ship strike scenarios. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Hexavalent chromium compounds are present in the atmosphere and oceans and are established mutagens and carcinogens in human and terrestrial mammals. However, the adverse effects of these toxicants in marine mammals are uncertain. Previously, we reported that North Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered great whales, have tissue chromium levels that are high, levels that may pose a risk to the whale's health. Furthermore, the study suggested that inhalation may be an important exposure route. Exposure to chromium through inhalation is mainly because of particulate compounds. However, the toxicity of particulate chromium compounds in marine mammal cells is unknown. Accordingly, in this study, we tested the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of particulate hexavalent chromium in primary cultured lung and skin fibroblasts from the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Cytotoxicity was measured by clonogenic survival assay, and genotoxicity was measured as production of chromosome aberrations. Particulate hexavalent chromium induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner in both right whale lung and skin fibroblasts. Lung fibroblasts were more resistant to chromium cytotoxicity, but presented with more chromosome damage than skin fibroblasts. These data further support the hypothesis that chromium may be a health concern for the endangered North Atlantic right whale. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Balancing human uses of the marine environment with the recovery of protected species requires accurate information on when and where species of interest are likely to be present. Here, we describe a system that can produce useful estimates of right whale Eubalaena glacialis presence and abundance on their feeding grounds in the Gulf of Maine. The foundation of our system is a coupled physical-biological model of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the preferred prey of right whales. From the modeled prey densities, we can estimate when whales will appear in the Great South Channel feeding ground. Based on our experience with the system, we consider how the relationship between right whales and copepods changes across spatial scales. The scale-dependent relationship between whales and copepods provides insight into how to improve future estimates of the distribution of right whales and other pelagic predators. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={Management plans to reduce human-caused deaths of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis depend, in part, on knowing when and where right whales are likely to be found. Local environmental conditions that influence movements of feeding right whales, such as ultradense copepod patches, are unpredictable and ephemeral. We examined the utility of using the regional-scale mean copepod concentration as an indicator of the abundance of right whales in 2 critical habitats off the northeastern coast of the United States: Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Right whales are usually found in Cape Cod Bay during the late winter and early spring, and in the Great South Channel during the late spring and early summer. We found a significant positive relationship between mean concentration of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in the western Gulf of Maine and the frequency of right whale sightings in the Great South Channel. In Cape Cod Bay we found a significant positive relationship between the mean concentration of other copepods (largely Pseudocalanus spp. and Centropages spp.) and the frequency of right whale sightings. This information could be used to further our understanding of the environmental factors that drive seasonal movement and aggregation of right whales in the Gulf of Maine, and it offers a tool to resource managers and modelers who seek to predict the movements of right whales based upon the concentration of copepods. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={Hexavalent chromium is an environmental contaminant. Within the environment, marine waters are a common site for hexavalent chromium deposition. We have recently reported significantly high levels of chromium in skin tissue from North Atlantic right whales. These findings demonstrate that marine species are being exposed to chromium. It is possible that such exposures may be playing a role in population declines evident among certain marine mammals, such as the Steller sea lion. We developed a Steller sea lion lung cell line from Steller sea lion lung tissue. Hexavalent chromium was cytotoxic to these primary lung fibroblasts as 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 μM sodium chromate induced 104, 99, 92, 58 and 11% relative survival, respectively. It was also genotoxic as 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged chromosomes in 6, 11, 21, 36, and 39% of metaphases and damaged 6, 12, 27, 49 and 57 total aberrations in 100 metaphases, respectively. We also considered the toxicity of particulate hexavalent chromium, as it is the more potent carcinogen in humans. We found that 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 μg/cm2 particulate chromate induced 95, 88, 91, 70, and 52% relative cell survival, respectively. These concentrations were genotoxic and damaged chromosomes in 9, 13, 18, and 23% of metaphases and induced 9, 15, 20 and 30 total aberrations per 100 metaphases, respectively. These data indicate that if sufficiently exposed, chromium may adversely affect the struggling Steller sea lion population. It would be prudent to investigate the effects chromium has in other Steller sea lion organs in order to derive a better understanding of how chromium in the marine environment may be affecting the declining Steller sea lion population. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Today, ocean and coastal marine resource management is extremely complex. Marine resource managers are charged with conserving and managing many diverse species. Southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), commonly known as whiting, are found from southern New England to Florida. During the fall through winter, western North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are primarily found in the coastal nearshore waters off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, overlapping the whiting's range and habitat. In January 2006, a right whale calf was discovered dead, as a result of gillnet entanglement, in close proximity to the Florida commercial whiting fishing grounds; thus, to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with developing appropriated right whale conservation management measures, this study evaluated the newly established commercial Florida whiting fishery. Findings revealed that the whiting fishery was established in 2004 and the fishery was prosecuted during the time and area where right whales were found. Moreover, the study found that whiting landings, market value, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), dealers, and fishing effort significantly increased during 2000 through 2005. As a result of the right whale calf mortality and threat of gillnet gear to whales, the NMFS prohibited the use of gillnet gear in the US southeastern waters, which inevitably closed the newly established whiting fishery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis feed predominantly on Calanus finmarchicus Stage V copepods. Calanus possesses 2 classes of storage lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and wax esters (WE), the latter comprising 94% of total lipids. Most mammals are incapable of metabolizing WE and thus eliminate it in their feces. The objective of this study was to determine whether right whales are capable of metabolizing both TAG and WE. We compared the lipid composition of copepods collected during plankton tows (n = 64) over 2 summers (2006 and 2007) with the lipid composition of 24 right whale fecal samples collected synoptically in the Bay of Fundy. Using ingestion and defecation models, we estimated that an average right whale (40 000 kg) ingests ∼58000 g of WE d-1 but eliminates only 250 g of WE, implying that right whales are assimilating over 99% (57765 g) of dietary WE. Lipids in the feces differed significantly from those of the diet. Copepod lipids were dominated by saturated fatty acid (FA) components 14:0 (14.73 ± 0.32wt%) and 16:0 (8.99 ± 0.20 wt%), with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated components comprising the remainder. Long chain monounsaturated 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-11 dominated the fatty alcohol composition of copepods. Fecal lipid composition consisted primarily of saturated FA, many of which were absent in the copepods. These data suggest that right whales have evolved an unusual metabolic capability, such as specialized enzymatic machinery or a gut symbiont, which, unlike other mammals, enables them to utilize most of their WE-rich diet. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={The goal of the present analysis was to assess the geographic scope and magnitude of non-market values for 6 regional aquatic species listed, or being considered for listing, as endangered under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. I used latent class analysis to partition responses from a national Internet-based survey that asked respondents about their preferred conservation program from amongst scenarios that varied according to target species (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, Atlantic whitefish Coregonus huntsmani, leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, porbeagle shark Lamna nasus, and white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus), program performance, cost, and method of payment. The large sample of the Canadian public (n = 2761) cleaved into 9 distinct segments that varied significantly in their patterns of preferences. Mean implicit prices, calculated using regression coefficients, ranged as high as CAD $85.99 annually for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. There was strong support for programs that had a high probability of success even though increases in population abundance and improvements in listing status were each only significant for 4 of the 9 segments. I also found evidence that members of 1 segment were unwilling or unable to make tradeoffs between the program attributes (i.e. they exhibited 'lexicographic preferences'). Members from all 9 segments were distributed across Canada, implying that the proper geographic scope of benefits assessments should be expanded beyond the regions in which regional aquatic species at risk actually occur. These findings should help ensure that the broad societal benefits of conservation are captured when making endangered species listing and investment decisions in Canada in the future. © Inter-Reaserch 2009.},

abstract={A vital component of marine policy is the conservation and management of diverse marine resources. In the southeastern US, commercial fishermen target black sea bass (Centropristis striata) with pots from North Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida. During the fall through spring fishing season, western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) distribution overlaps the black sea bass commercial pot fishery. Fishermen interviews revealed that the number of pots set ranged from 3 to 240 and the number of pots set per trawl ranged from 1 to 18. Generally, the amount of gear increased from south to north. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As an initial step in defining the transcriptome of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and developing functional genomic tools to study right whale health at the molecular physiological level, a cDNA library has been constructed from a skin biopsy. 2496 randomly selected clones (expressed sequence tags, ESTs) have been sequenced, and genes identified as important in the response to stress and immune challenges have been cloned by targeted RT-PCR from skin cDNA. The analysis of the EST collection (archived at www.marinegenomics.org and GenBank) showed a 34.79% redundancy, yielding 1578 unigenes and 27 potential microsatellite markers. 96 genes were cloned by targeted PCR; moreover, 52 of these genes are stress and immune function related. A Gene Ontology analysis of the unigene collection indicates that the skin is a rich source of expressed genes with diverse functions, suggesting an important role in multiple physiological processes including those related to immunity and stress response. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={In this paper, the problem of detecting and recognizing North Atlantic right whale (NARW), Eubalaena glacialis, contact calls in the presence of ambient noise is considered. A proposed solution is based on a multistage, hypothesis-testing technique that involves the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, spectrogram testing, and feature vector testing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are the inclusion of noise kernels for signals likely to produce false alarms and a second stage classification algorithm which extracts parameters from candidate contact calls and constructs a scaled squared error statistic for parameters which lie outside the range of expected calls. Closed-form representations of the algorithms are derived and realizable detection schemes are developed. Test results show that the proposed technique is able to detect approximately 80% of the contact calls detected by the human operator with about 26 false alarms per 24 h of observation. Testing data set included 44 227 right whale contact calls detected by eight human operators who performed visual and aural inspection of the data spectrogram. Data were collected in different periods from March 2001 to February 2007, in Cape Cod Bay, Great South Channel, and in the coastal waters of Georgia. © 2009, by The Institute of Electrical Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

abstract={Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is emerging as a major concern for aquatic environments, particularly marine environments. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) has been used as a model species for human and aquatic health, including the marine environment, though few studies have directly compared toxicological responses in medaka to humans or other aquatic species. We used a medaka fin cell line to compare the genotoxic response of medaka to Cr(VI) to the response observed in North Atlantic right whale cells to see if responses in medaka were similar to those of other aquatic species, particularly aquatic mammals. We used the production of chromosomal aberrations as a measure of genotoxicity. We found that in medaka cells, concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged 17, 32 and 43% of metaphases, respectively and these same concentrations 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged 14, 24 and 49% of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale lung cells and 11, 32 and 41% of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale testes cells. These data show that genotoxic responses in medaka are comparable to those seen in North Atlantic right whale cells, consistent with the hypothesis that medaka are a useful model for other aquatic species. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A proposed solution is based on a multiple-stage hypothesistesting technique. The closed form representations of the algorithms are derived, and realizable detection schemes are developed. Empirical tests were conducted using data recordings collected in 2007 off the coast of Massachusetts. Results reveal that the proposed technique is able to detect approximately 80% of the calls detected by the human operator and to produce an average of 12.0 - 33.5 false alarms per 24 h of observation. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Incidental mortality from entanglements in fishing gear is threatening cetacean populations worldwide. In eastern Canadian waters, entanglement deaths of the critically endangered transboundary North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) are a key conservation concern and incidental mortalities of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in gillnets are a major source of mortality. Since the 1990s, a number of mitigation techniques to reduce mortalities in both species have been tested and the use of some in the US commercial fishery have been legislated. Despite this, the North Atlantic right whale population remains in a precarious state and entanglement deaths of harbour porpoise have been increasing in recent years. Further, mitigation devices, such as acoustic alarms, carry with them concerns about habituation, noise pollution, maintenance requirements and cost. The modifying of the physical characteristics of commercial fishing gear has shown some promise at reducing entanglement mortalities in initial testing while avoiding many of the drawbacks of other mitigation methods. In this study the current state of development and effectiveness of mitigation techniques through the addition of barium sulphate to fishing gear rope and twine were investigated. The development of a neutrally buoyant groundline, through the addition of barium sulphate, was undertaken in order to reduce the probability of large whale entanglements in lobster pot gear. The resulting product maintained a much lower profile in the water column relative to traditional polypropylene groundline, however, it was found unsuitable for hard-bottom areas as it was susceptible to chaffing and breaking. In order to reduce mortalities once large whales are entangled, a weak rope was developed again with the addition of barium sulphate. The breaking strength of this product was found to be 1,0651b which meets the US legislated limits (1,1001b), as opposed to traditional polypropylene rope which had a breaking strength of over 2,4001b. To meet the challenge of harbour porpoise entanglements, a gillnet twine was developed to have an increased acoustic profile and a more stiff form through the addition of barium sulphate. In field testing trials, the barium sulphate modified gillnets reduced harbour porpoise bycatch and had minimal effects on targeted groundfishes. Although they are in an early state of development, barium sulphate modified fishing gear shows promise at reducing entanglement deaths of cetaceans.},

abstract={A primary factor threatening the recovery of the North Atlantic right whale is the ongoing risk of collision with large ocean-going vessels. Hence, any viable conservation strategy must include mitigation of this risk. In particular, the critical wintering habitat off the Atlantic shores of the southeastern United States overlaps with the shipping routes of some of the region's busiest ports. As a first step in the process of ship strike risk mitigation for this region, we estimated the risk associated with current patterns of shipping traffic, and compared this with estimates of risk for a set of hypothetical alternative routes. As a measure of risk, we selected the co-occurrence of whales and vessels within cells of a 4 km grid. We performed parametric estimation of whale encounter rate and associated risk within a Bayesian hierarchical model, using data from aerial surveys and the Mandatory Ship Reporting System of the SE United States, along with a selection of environmental covariates. Importantly, we were able to account for annual and monthly variation in encounters in our estimates. All alternative routes provided reduced overall risk, ranging from a 27 to 44% reduction, relative to the estimated risk of observed traffic. The largest marginal gains in risk reduction were attained by restricting traffic associated with the busiest port, Jacksonville, Florida, but restrictions on all ports achieved the highest reduction. We emphasize the importance of accounting for temporal as well as spatial variation in whale encounter rates, given the migratory behavior of the species. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts) is the only known winter and early spring feeding area for concentrations of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) population. During January-May, 1998-2002, 167 aerial surveys were conducted (66,466 km of total survey effort), providing a complete representation of the spatiotemporal distribution of right whales in the bay during winter and spring. A total of 1553 right whales were sighted; some of these sightings were multiple sightings of the same individuals. Right whale distribution and relative abundance patterns were quantified as sightings per unit of effort (SPUE) and partitioned into 103 23-km2 cells and 12 2-week periods. Significant interannual variations in mean SPUE and timing of SPUE maxima were likely due to physically forced changes in available food resources. The area of greatest SPUE expanded and contracted during the season but its center remained in the eastern bay. Most cells with SPUE&gt;0 were inside the federal critical habitat (CH) and this finding gave evidence of the need for management measures within CH boundaries to reduce anthropogenic mortality from vessel strikes and entanglement. There was significant within-season SPUE variability: low in December-January, increasing to a maximum in late February-early April, and declining to zero in May; and these results provide support for management measures from 1 January-15 May.},

abstract={Vocalisations were recorded in the vicinity of sighted blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) in the North Atlantic between Iceland and Greenland in August 2004 from a hydrophone towed behind a research vessel and from free floating sonobuoys. The structures of recorded calls were broadly similar to those reported from other areas, but lacked the stereotypical patterning of those signals thought to represent reproductive displays. Counts of non-patterned blue whale calls indicated low vocalisation rates, with a mean of 0.62 phrases per whale per hour (0.12 A-B and 0.49 arch phrases per whale per hour). However, vocalisations were highly clustered in time, with 80% of blue whale calls ascribed to the focal animals arriving within a single 80 second period. It is not clear what behavioural, geographical or seasonal trends may influence the vocalisation rate of large baleen whales, and thus direct comparisons between areas are difficult. However, it is hoped the results presented will be of use in interpreting remote recordings of blue whales made from the North Atlantic. Hydrophones were also monitored continuously over 7,757km of trackline using an automated detection algorithm developed for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, no North Atlantic right whales were seen or heard during the study period.},

abstract={A total of 44 records of southern right whale mortalities and non-fatal anthropogenic interactions have been documented in Australia by museums, wildlife agencies and researchers since 1950. Sixteen of the events involved whales that apparently survived. Events were recorded in all months except January and 65% occurred in the period July to October. Mortalities were more numerous in the western half of the continent where southern right whales are more frequently observed. Events were classified according to their outcome and nature: carcasses (with no evidence of human interaction) n=25, fatal entanglements n=1, non-fatal entanglements n=12, fatal vessel collisions n=2, non-fatal vessel collisions n=3, non-fatal shooting n=1. No live strandings were recorded. The number of both mortalities and non-fatal anthropogenic incidents has increased 4-fold since the mid 1970s. More calves than 'non-calf' whales were present in the carcass category, whereas the opposite was the case for events involving hurnan interaction. Lines, nets and buoys used in fishing crustaceans (rock-lobster, crab) were associated with several entanglements (n=5). A longline entanglement of a 14m female resulted in a chronic injury, debilitation and death. As a proportion of the total records for each region, there were fewer vessel collisions of right whales in Australia (11%) than in South Africa (16%) or the North Atlantic (35%).},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is the most critically endangered large cetacean and is threatened by vessels that travel in their habitats and migration paths. A need to address the endangered population status of the right whale emerges as current management mandates have proven ineffective at preventing vessel-strikes to right whales and current rates of strike-induced mortality can slow or prevent recovery of the species. This paper identifies the need for an internationally acceptable management strategy to minimize vessel-strikes to right whales in Canadian waters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis is endangered, in part, due to vessel-strike mortality. We use vessel traffic and right whale survey data (∼3 nautical miles [n miles], ∼5.6 km resolution) for the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (northwest Atlantic) to determine the relative risk of lethal vessel encounters by using 2 estimates: (1) the event - the relative probability of a vessel encountering a right whale, and (2) the consequence - the probability of a lethal injury arising from an encounter. For the Bay of Fundy region our estimates demonstrate that the relative risk of lethal collision could be reduced by 62 % by means of an amendment to the traffic separation scheme (TSS) that intersects a Right Whale Conservation Area. In the Roseway Basin region of the Scotian Shelf, the majority of vessels navigate outside of a Right Whale Conservation Area, although the highest relative risk is concentrated within the Conservation Area where fewer vessels navigate at greater speed. Here, our estimates demonstrate that a seasonal recommendatory area to be avoided (ATBA) could be designed to reduce the risk imposed by vessels upon right whales in the region. Our estimates contributed to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adoption of a TSS amendment in the Bay of Fundy and an ATBA on the Scotian Shelf. Thus, the goal of achieving the greatest reduction in the risk of lethal vessel-encounters with whales, balanced by some minimal disruption to vessel operations while maintaining safe navigation, can be achieved. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Fecal analysis from the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale provides valuable information about health and reproductive parameters of individual animals. Genetically profiling the feces facilitates this connection when the sample originator is unknown. Although genetic analysis of feces collected in terrestrial systems has become well established, genetic studies of cetacean DNA are rare. Here, the use of free-floating feces as a source of right whale DNA and the reliability of the genotypes produced are examined. On average, fecal extracts yielded 25 ng of DNA/mg dry weight, but less than 1% was right whale DNA. Although all samples were amplified using genus-specific mitochondrial control region primers, the quantity of right whale DNA present was over estimated when compared to amplifications using nuclear primers. No correlation was found between the quantity of right whale DNA recovered and the duration the sample sat in the water. Composite microsatellite profiles from multiple amplifications of 28 fecal samples of known origin were consistent with profiles of the same individuals obtained from skin biopsies, however, the rate of allelic dropout varied depending on the amount of right whale DNA added. A screening and genotyping protocol for reliable genetic profiling based on fecal DNA quantification is presented. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Two test systems were developed to evaluate the influence of draw-length and tissue compliance on entanglement-induced epidermal abrasion in humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) tissue samples. Under straight pull abrasion tests, an adult right whale fluke required 3.7 times the load and 15 times the draw-length of a right whale calf flipper to induce epidermal failure whereas a humpback fluke was intermediate between these extremes. A load applied tangentially to the leading edge of the fluke or flipper resulted in a substantial, but reversible, deflection of the leading edge in the direction of the applied load. The maximum possible deformation of the leading edge under shear load, prior to the line slipping relative to the skin, was defined as the tissue compliance limit. Oscillatory abrasion tests revealed that line draw-lengths exceeding the tissue compliance limit resulted in substantially increased tissue abrasion. In actual entanglements, line draw-length relative to the tissue compliance may determine if the line will cut into the body or simply press against the skin. Increasing the entangling line's ability to stretch in response to a load could potentially minimize sliding of the line relative to the skin and help mitigate entanglement injuries. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={The problem of detection and recognition of contact calls produced by North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, is considered. A proposed solution is based on a multiple-stage hypothesis-testing technique involving a spectrogram-based detector, spectrogram testing, and feature vector testing algorithms. Results show that the proposed technique is able to detect over 80% of the contact calls detected by a human operator and to produce about 26 false alarms per 24 h of observation.},

abstract={Although hexavalent chromium is a known genotoxic agent in human and terrestrial mammals and is present in seawater and air, its effects on marine mammals including the endangered North Atlantic right whale are unknown and untested. The present study investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of hexavalent chromium in primary cultured North Atlantic right whale lung and testes fibroblasts and levels of total chromium in skin biopsies from North Atlantic right whales. Cytotoxicity was measured by clonogenic survival assay. Genotoxicity was measured as production of chromosome aberrations. Tissue chromium levels were determined from skin biopsies of healthy free-ranging whales in the Bay of Fundy using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Hexavalent chromium-induced concentration-dependent increases in right whale lung and testes fibroblast cytotoxicity with the testes more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects. It also induced concentration-dependent increases in chromosomal aberrations in both cell types with no significant difference in sensitivity. Skin biopsy data indicate that North Atlantic right whales are exposed to chromium and accumulate a range of 4.9-10 μg Cr/g tissue with a mean of 7.1 μg/g. Hexavalent chromium is cytotoxic and genotoxic to North Atlantic right whale cells. The whales have tissue chromium levels that are concerning. These data support a hypothesis that chromium may be a concern for the health of the North Atlantic right whales. Considering these data with chromium chemistry, whale physiology and atmospheric chromium levels further suggest that inhalation may be an important exposure route. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The coastal waters of the southeast United States between Brunswick, Georgia, and Cape Canaveral, Florida, is the only known calving ground for the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). On 1 January 2005, during the New England Aquarium research team's standard aerial survey, a single right whale was observed at the surface 17 nmi east of the northern tip of Talbot Island, Florida. While circling over the whale to obtain photographs for individual identification, observers noticed a red coloration visible in the water around the whale that looked like blood. The water around the whale's belly, side, and flukes was clearly red, but the color was dispersing quickly due to the thrashing behavior of the whale. After 3 min and 37 s of observation, a calf appeared to the side of the adult. The calf had no visible cyamid coverage on the head, body, or flukes. The flukes appeared to be slightly limp and curled under at both tips. The mother lifted the calf to the surface on her back. As the mother rose to the surface, the calf was draped limply over her body. The calf rolled off the mother's back into the water and began to swim next to the mother. The event described here is the first known observation of behaviors that have been interpreted as a birth of a right whale calf.},

abstract={Vessel-whale collision events represented the ultimate cause of death for 21 (52.5%) of the 40 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) necropsied between 1970 and December 2006. Injuries seen in vessel-struck whales fall into two distinct categories: 1) sharp trauma, often resulting from contact with the propeller, and 2) blunt trauma, presumably resulting from contact with a vessel's hull. This study analyzes four trauma cases that resulted from vessel-whale collisions, which together provide a framework for a more critical understanding of lethal blunt and sharp trauma resulting from vessel collisions with right whales. In case no. 1, contact with a propeller resulted in three deep lacerations. The animal survived acute trauma only to succumb nearly 14 years later when the lesions reopened and became infected. In case no. 2, anecdotal reports linked the laceration of large arteries of the peduncle and histologic evidence of perimortem trauma at a bone fracture site to vessel-whale collision trauma. Case no. 3 had a laceration of the oral rete and a fracture of the rostrum. Both of the areas displayed histologic evidence of perimortem blunt trauma. Finally, in case no. 4, an antemortem mandibular fracture, two additional skull fractures, and widespread hemorrhage were consistent with severe blunt trauma. Evidence from each case, including the timing of trauma relative to the time of death and identifying characteristics of both trauma types, are presented. Before this study, no detailed comparative analysis of trauma pathology that resulted from lethal interactions between vessels and right whales had been conducted. This study demonstrates the importance of detailed gross and histologic examination in determining the significance and timing of traumatic events. This work represents a new paradigm for the differential diagnosis of lethal sharp and blunt trauma in right whales hit by ships and will enhance the present understanding of the impact of anthropogenic mortality on this critically endangered species.

abstract={During the 16th and 17th centuries, Basque whalers travelled annually to the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence to hunt whales. The hunting that occurred during this period is of primary significance for the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), because it has been interpreted as the largest human-induced reduction of the western North Atlantic population, with ∼12250-21000 whales killed. It has been frequently reported that the Basques targeted two species in this region: the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. To evaluate this hypothesis and the relative impact of this period of whaling on both species, we collected samples from 364 whale bones during a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Bones were found and sampled at 10 of the 20 sites investigated. DNA was extracted from a subset (n = 218) of these samples. Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b region identified five whale species. The identification of only a single right whale bone and 203 bowhead whale bones from at least 72 individuals indicates that the bowhead whale was likely the principal target of the hunt. These results imply that this whaling had a much greater impact (in terms of numbers of whales removed) on the bowhead whale population than on the western North Atlantic right whale population. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={1. The significance of killer whale Orcinus orca predation on baleen whales (Mysticeti) has been a topic of considerable discussion and debate in recent years. Discourse has been constrained by poor understanding of predator-prey dynamics, including the relative vulnerability of different mysticete species and age classes to killer whales and how these prey animals avoid predation. Here we provide an overview and analysis of predatory interactions between killer whales and mysticetes, with an emphasis on patterns of antipredator responses. 2. Responses of baleen whales to predatory advances and attacks by killer whales appear to fall into two distinct categories, which we term the fight and flight strategies. The fight strategy consists of active physical defence, including self-defence by single individuals, defence of calves by their mothers and coordinated defence by groups of whales. It is documented for five mysticetes: southern right whale Eubalaena australis, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. The flight strategy consists of rapid (20-40 km/ h) directional swimming away from killer whales and, if overtaken and attacked, individuals do little to defend themselves. This strategy is documented for six species in the genus Balaenoptera. 3. Many aspects of the life history, behaviour and morphology of mysticetes are consistent with their antipredator strategy, and we propose that evolution of these traits has been shaped by selection for reduced predation. Fight species tend to have robust body shapes and are slow but relatively manoeuvrable swimmers. They often calve or migrate in coastal areas where proximity to shallow water provides refuge and an advantage in defence. Most fight species have either callosities (rough and hardened patches of skin) or encrustations of barnacles on their bodies, which may serve (either primarily or secondarily) as weapons or armour for defence. Flight species have streamlined body shapes for high-speed swimming and they can sustain speeds necessary to outrun pursuing killer whales (>15-20 km/h). These species tend to favour pelagic habitats and calving grounds where prolonged escape sprints from killer whales are possible. 4. The rarity of observed successful attacks by killer whales on baleen whales, especially adults, may be an indication of the effectiveness of these antipredator strategies. Baleen whales likely offer low profitability to killer whales, relative to some other marine mammal prey. High-speed pursuit of flight species has a high energetic cost and a low probability of success while attacks on fight species can involve prolonged handling times and a risk of serious injury. © Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whale feeding and calving behaviors provide predictable spatial and temporal windows in which to conduct surveys and facilitate collection of opportunistic sightings data. Migration behavior makes it more difficult to locate and sample marine animals systematically or to observe them opportunistically. The lack of data creates a critical gap in understanding social behavior; it also hampers the development of mitigation strategies to anthropogenic disturbances such as vessel strikes, acoustic pollution and entanglements. We employ regression analysis to fill this gap to model northerly movements of North Atlantic right whales in the coastal mid-Atlantic migratory corridor of the United States. The modeling suggests an early to mid-March departure from Jacksonville, Florida, with a 30 day departure range; an average travel time of 21-24 days to the tip of Long Island, corresponding to a mean migration/displacement rate of 1.5-1.7 knots (2.8-3.1 km/h). Right whales migrating with calves begin their northern migration several days after right whales migrating without calves. These statistical models can supplement the absence of migratory survey data and help direct and stratify survey efforts in migratory corridors. The combination of rigorous statistical prediction with direct observation also should facilitate the creation of more effective mitigation measures. The methods employed here can be applied to other megafauna elsewhere around the world in many situations where migratory data are sparse. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The impact of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals has been an area of increasing concern over the past two decades. Most low-frequency anthropogenic noise in the ocean comes from commercial shipping which has contributed to an increase in ocean background noise over the past 150 years. The long-term impacts of these changes on marine mammals are not well understood. This paper describes both short- and long-term behavioral changes in calls produced by the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) in the presence of increased low-frequency noise. Right whales produce calls with a higher average fundamental frequency and they call at a lower rate in high noise conditions, possibly in response to masking from low-frequency noise. The long-term changes have occurred within the known lifespan of individual whales, indicating that a behavioral change, rather than selective pressure, has resulted in the observed differences. This study provides evidence of a behavioral change in sound production of right whales that is correlated with increased noise levels and indicates that right whales may shift call frequency to compensate for increased band-limited background noise. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={We present a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for marine mammals, coupled with a pharmacokinetic model of a lipophilic persistent toxicant. Inputs to the model are energy availability and lipid-normalized toxicant concentration in the environment. The model predicts individual growth, reproduction, bioaccumulation, and transfer of energy and toxicant from mothers to their young. We estimated all model parameters for the right whale; with these parameters, reduction in energy availability increases the age at first parturition, increases intervals between reproductive events, reduces the organisms' ability to buffer seasonal fluctuations, and increases its susceptibility to temporal shifts in the seasonal peak of energy availability. Reduction in energy intake increases bioaccumulation and the amount of toxicant transferred from mother to each offspring. With high energy availability, the toxicant load of offspring decreases with birth order. Contrary to expectations, this ordering may be reversed with lower energy availability. Although demonstrated with parameters for the right whale, these relationships between energy intake and energetics and pharmacokinetics of organisms are likely to be much more general. Results specific to right whales include energy assimilation estimates for the North Atlantic and southern right whale, influences of history of energy availability on reproduction, and a relationship between ages at first parturition and calving intervals. Our model provides a platform for further analyses of both individual and population responses of marine mammals to pollution, and to changes in energy availability, including those likely to arise through climate change. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Parentage analyses of baleen whales are rare, and although mating systems have been hypothesized for some species, little data on realized male reproductive success are available and the patterns of male reproductive success have remained elusive for most species. Here we combine over 20 years of photo-identification data with high-resolution genetic data for the majority of individual North Atlantic right whales to assess paternity in this endangered species. There was significant skew in male reproductive success compared to what would be expected if mating was random (P < 0.001). The difference was due to an excess of males assigned zero paternities, a deficiency of males assigned one paternity, and an excess of males assigned as fathers for multiple calves. The variance in male reproductive success was high relative to other aquatically mating marine mammals, but was low relative to mammals where the mating system is based on resource- and/or mate-defence polygyny. These results are consistent with previous data suggesting that the right whale mating system represents one of the most intense examples of sperm competition in mammals, but that sperm competition on its own does not allow for the same degree of polygyny as systems where males can control access to resources and/or mates. The age distribution of assigned fathers was significantly biased towards older males (P < 0.05), with males not obtaining their first paternity until ∼15 years of age, which is almost twice the average age of first fertilization in females (8 years), suggesting that mate competition is preventing younger males from reproducing. The uneven distribution of paternities results in a lower effective population size in this species that already has one of the lowest reported levels of genetic diversity, which may further inhibit reproductive success through mate incompatibility of genetically similar individuals. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={The Massachusetts Bay (MB) and Cape Cod Bay (CCB) system is a unique coastal embayment, with CCB serving as a high-use feeding ground for endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis during winter and early spring. We used a hydrodynamic model, observed Calanus finmarchicus (the preferred prey of right whales) abundance, and right whale sightings during 1997-2004 to examine the transport and retention of C. finmarchicus in MB-CCB and the implications for right whale activity. A particle-tracking program was embedded into the model to simulate the Lagrangian residual circulation, and the transport and retention of passive particles. The results indicate significant correlations in the inter-annual variability of coastal transport, circulation pattern, C. finmarchicus abundance, and right whale sightings in spring. In normal years (with prevailing northwesterly winds), the monthly mean distributions of particles and Lagrangian residual currents show a coherent pattern with 2 particle retention areas in central CCB and central MB, respectively. The CCB retention area closely matches the area of high probability of right whale occurrence and feeding activity, indicating that this is an area favorable to zooplankton aggregations. In other years (e.g. 2002), the coastal current is significantly reduced due to prevailing southwesterly winds, and the particle retention zone is shifted northward, coincident with low C. finmarchicus abundance and whale sightings in CCB. The study also suggests that the North Atlantic Oscillation may influence C. finmarchicus abundance and distributions, and hence, right whale feeding activity in CCB through surface winds affecting MB-CCB circulation, and hence, zooplankton distributions. © Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract={Nonlinear phenomena or nonlinearities in animal vocalizations include features such as subharmonics, deterministic chaos, biphonation, and frequency jumps that until recently were generally ignored in acoustic analyses. Recent documentation of these phenomena in several species suggests that they may play a communicative role, though the exact function is still under investigation. Here, qualitative descriptions and quantitative analyses of nonlinearities in the vocalizations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are provided. All four nonlinear features were present in both species, with at least one feature occurring in 92.4% of killer and 65.7% of right whale vocalizations analyzed. Occurrence of biphonation varied the most between species, being present in 89.0% of killer whale vocalizations and only 20.4% of right whale vocalizations. Because deterministic chaos is qualitatively and quantitatively different than random or Gaussian noise, a program (TISEAN©) designed specifically to identify deterministic chaos to confirm the presence of this nonlinearity was used. All segments tested in this software indicate that both species do indeed exhibit deterministic chaos. The results of this study provide confirmation that such features are common in the vocalizations of cetacean species and lay the groundwork for future studies. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={A year-long acoustic survey for critically endangered North Atlantic right whales was conducted at two sites on the central and western Scotian Shelf. Autonomous hydrophones recorded sound continuously from July 2004 to August 2005. Right whale contact calls (upcalls) were identified using automatic recognition software, and the resulting detections were checked manually. Substantial numbers of hours with upcalls were observed at both sites, with approximately four times as many hours with calls at the western site as the central one. Calls occurred mainly from August through October, with the earliest calls in late June and the latest at the end of December at both sites. In addition to this seasonal trend, there was a significant diel pattern in calling at the central site but not at the more westerly site. Results are analyzed in light of feeding ecology and broad-scale movements of right whales. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Marine mammal social interactions are poorly understood primarily because of the difficulty of observing these behaviors in the wild. Observations of copulations in North Atlantic right whale surface active groups (SAGs) have led to the hypothesis that the function of these groups is for conception. The occurrence and composition of SAGs sighted from 1992 to 2001 were investigated on the basis of age, sex, and reproductive status of individuals. A total of 918 SAG events were documented. SAGs were observed in all habitat areas and in all months in which right whales were sighted. Group compositions revealed both potentially conceptive groups and nonconceptive groups. Of right whales whose age was known, 93% were first sighted in SAGs as juveniles, and more than half of all observed groups contained at least one juvenile whale. The group composition and timing of occurrence of SAGs do not support the hypothesis that all groups serve a purely conceptive function. Their functional role is likely much broader. Other potential functions include play, mating practice, or maintenance of social bonds. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of detection of contact calls produced by the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis. To reduce computational time, the class of acceptable detectors is constrained by the detectors implemented as a bank of two-dimensional linear FIR filters and using the data spectrogram as the input. The closed form representations for the detectors are derived and the detection performance is compared with that of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector. The test results demonstrate that in the presence of impulsive noise, the spectrogram-based detector using the French hat wavelet as the filter kernel outperforms the GLRT detector and decreases computational time by a factor of 6. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Some knowledge of the hearing abilities of right whales is important for understanding their acoustic communication system and possible impacts of anthropogenic noise. Traditional behavioral or physiological techniques to test hearing are not feasible with right whales. Previous research on the hearing of marine mammals has shown that functional models are reliable estimators of hearing sensitivity in marine species. Fundamental to these models is a comprehensive analysis of inner ear anatomy. Morphometric analyses of 18 inner ears from 13 stranded North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were used for development of a preliminary model of the frequency range of hearing. Computerized tomography was used to create two-dimensional (2D) and 3D images of the cochlea. Four ears were decalcified and sectioned for histologic measurements of the basilar membrane. Basilar membrane length averaged 55.7 mm (range, 50.5 mm-61.7 mm). The ganglion cell density/mm averaged 1,842 ganglion cells/mm. The thickness/width measurements of the basilar membrane from slides resulted in an estimated hearing range of 10 Hz-22 kHz based on established marine mammal models. Additional measurements from more specimens will be necessary to develop a more robust model of the right whale hearing range. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={The population structure and mitochondrial (mt) DNA diversity of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) are described from 146 individuals sampled on 4 winter calving grounds (Argentina, South Africa, Western Australia, and the New Zealand sub-Antarctic) and 2 summer feeding grounds (South Georgia and south of Western Australia). Based on a consensus region of 275 base pairs of the mtDNA control region, 37 variable sites defined 37 unique haplotypes, of which only one was shared between regional samples of the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the southern right whale haplotypes revealed 2 distinct clades that differed significantly in frequencies between oceans. An analysis of molecular variance confirmed significant overall differentiation among the 4 calving grounds at both the haplotype and the nucleotype levels (FST = 0.159; ΦST = 0.238; P &lt; 0.001). Haplotype diversity was significantly lower in the Indo-Pacific (h = 0.701 ± 0.037) compared with the South Atlantic (h = 0.948 ± 0.013), despite a longer history of exploitation and larger catches in the South Atlantic. In fact, the haplotype diversity in the Indo-Pacific basin was similar to that of the North Atlantic right whale that currently numbers about 300 animals. Multidimensional scaling of genetic differentiation suggests that gene flow occurred primarily between adjacent calving grounds within an ocean basin, with mixing of lineages from different calving grounds occurring on feeding grounds. © The American Genetic Association. 2007.

abstract={Historical records demonstrate that the most numerous, per capita, ocean-going-vessel strikes recorded among large-whale species accrue to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). As vessel speed restrictions are being considered to reduce the likelihood and severity of vessel collisions with right whales, we present an analysis of the published historical records of vessels striking large whales. We examine the influence of vessel speed in contributing to either a lethal injury (defined as killed or severely injured) or a nonlethal injury (defined as minor or no apparent injury) to a large whale when struck. A logistic regression model fitted to the observations, and consistent with a bootstrap model, demonstrates that the greatest rate of change in the probability of a lethal injury (Plethal) to a large whale occurs between vessel speeds of 8.6 and 15 knots where Plethal increases from 0.21 to 0.79. The probability of a lethal injury drops below 0.5 at 11.8 knots. Above 15 knots, Plethal asymptotically approaches 1. The uncertainties in the logistic regression estimates are relatively large at relatively low speeds (e.g., at 8 knots the probability is 0.17 with a 95% CI of 0.03-0.6). The results we provide can be used to assess the utility of vessel speed limits that are being considered to reduce the lethality of vessels striking the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale and other large whales that are frequent victims of vessel strikes. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={The aim of this work is the redaction of a comprehensive catalogue of the living Cetaceans preserved in the Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa (Italy), now located in the seventeenth-century old Cartusian of Calci (Pisa) where the whole collection was moved during the Eigthies of the last century from the historical location at the Institute of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy of the University in the town of Pisa. This is the most important collection existing in Italy for the number of taxa being included (27), seven of them being the sole present in Italian museums. Noteworthy are the skeletons of some large size species, among which the Blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus) and the Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis ) are the sole complete ones existing in Italy in addition to the adults of the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the Northern right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis). The collection must also be appreciated for several exotic species. The 53 skeletons here stored were mostly acquired during the XIX Century, thanks to prof. Sebastiano Richiardi, director of the Institute from 1871 to 1904, and increased from his successor, prof. Eugenio Ficalbi from 1905 to1922. This catalogue has been compiled throughout a long term study begun in 1984 and concluded only several years later, after the transfer of the collection to its present seat: as a matter of fact, an accurate revision of the conditions of the specimens was essential after the move and the final layout. At the same time, a wide documental research was run on the archivial historical sources, concerning the acquisition of the specimens, with many original information on the long history of the building of the collection; detailed data on the costs of several purchasing contracts are also reported. The catalogue lists each specimen in systematic order, with its taxonomic references and description of the fundamental osteometrical parameters. Specific bibliography concerning every specimen of the collection is also shown. © 2007, Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A data set consisting of North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) vocalizations were provided as part of the 2003 International Workshop on Detection and Localization of Marine Mammals using Passive Acoustics in Halifax, Nova Scotia. These vocalizations were processed using a set of detection and localization algorithms developed as part of the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) program. Localization is performed using hyperbolic multilateration on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) data from a two stage FFT based energy detector. Binary FFTs are computed from the raw time series by thresholding the FFT using a time average in each bin as the threshold criteria. Clicks are detected by comparing the total number of bins above threshold to a secondary threshold. Detected clicks are split out of the data stream and the rest of the data is aligned using a spectrogram cross-correlation. Details of the marine mammal monitoring algorithms will be presented as well as results from the data set. ©2006 IEEE.},

abstract={A North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) genomic library was developed and screened with a (GATA)8 probe to identify tetranucleotide microsatellite loci. Sixteen characterized loci were polymorphic in North Atlantic and/or South Atlantic (Eubalaena australis) right whales, 12 being polymorphic in E. glacialis, and 15 in E. australis. Fourteen of these were combined with 21 other previously identified loci for a suite of 35 loci which can be used to increase resolution of genetic analyses of these species. Multiplex reactions were developed for genotyping samples at these loci, providing a method that is rapid, reliable and cost-effective. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={Feeding behavior, prey type, and habitat appear to be associated with the morphological design of body, fluke, and flippers in baleen whales. Morphometric data from whaling records and recent stranding events were compiled, and morphometric parameters describing the body length, and fluke and flipper dimensions for an "average" blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, and right whale Eubalaena glacialis were determined. Body mass, body volume, body surface area, and fluke and flipper surface areas were estimated. The resultant morphological configurations lent themselves to the following classifications based on hydrodynamic principles: fast cruiser, slow cruiser, fast maneuverer, and slow maneuverer. Blue whales have highly stream-lined bodies with small, high aspect ratio flippers and flukes for fast efficient cruising in the open ocean. On the other hand, the rotund right whale has large, high aspect ratio flukes for efficient slow speed cruising that is optimal for their continuous filter feeding technique. Humpbacks have large, high aspect ratio flippers and a large, low aspect ratio tail for quick acceleration and high-speed maneuvering which would help them catch their elusive prey, while gray whales have large, low aspect ratio flippers and flukes for enhanced low-speed maneuvering in complex coastal water habitats. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of passive acoustic detection of contact calls produced by the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. The proposed solution is based on using a generalized likelihood ratio test detector of polynomial-phase signals with unknown amplitude and polynomial coefficients observed in the presence of locally stationary Gaussian noise. The closed form representation for a minimal sufficient statistic is derived and a realizable detection scheme is developed. The receiver operation characteristic curves are calculated using empirical data recordings containing known right whale calls. The curves demonstrate that the proposed detector provides superior detection performance as compared with other known detection techniques for northern right whale contact calls. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Cape Cod Bay is the only known winter-feeding ground of the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, and is thus a critical habitat for right whales. As with most coastal ecosystems, Cape Cod Bay is a dynamic system with a high degree of variability in both physical and biological parameters. However, the extent of these fluctuations and their effect on the suitability of the bay as a right-whale feeding ground are not known. This study was conducted to address variability in the biological and physical environment of the bay and the possible impacts of this variability on the right whales' use of the area as a feeding ground. This study synthesized data collected from January to May, in 2000 to 2003. During 2002, the whales made very limited use of the bay compared to the other 3 yr, providing a unique opportunity for comparing conditions in the bay during this change in pattern of usage by the whales. Data on the physical and biological environment of Cape Cod Bay were collected during weekly cruises. These data indicated that there was significant interannual variation in the wind-forcing affecting Cape Cod Bay. Coincident with this variation were changes in the hydrography of the bay, suggesting that circulation patterns changed during the course of the study. Circulation changes affected the zooplankton prey of the whales either directly through changes in advection, or indirectly by affecting the production of the zooplankton. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={Very little is known about the endocrinology of the baleen whales. The highly endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) is a good model species, because most NARW individuals are photo-identified with known histories. We used an 125I corticosterone assay, shown to reliably measure cortisol metabolites, to determine glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in 177 NARW fecal samples collected between 1999-2004 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations varied significantly with sex and reproductive category, being highest in pregnant females (mean ±SE: 238.14 ± 74.37 ng/g) and mature males (71.6 ± 11.36), intermediate in lactating females (39.33 ± 5.82), and lower in non-reproducing females (23.11 ± 4.25) and immature males (34.33 ± 5.01) and females (14.0 ± 0.41). One case also suggests that glucocorticoids rise markedly in response to severe entanglement in fishing lines. Whales with fecal glucocorticoid content over 100 ng/g (termed "high-cort" samples) were rare, and included most pregnant females, some mature males, a fatally entangled whale, and several very young animals. Glucocorticoid concentrations were highly correlated with androgen concentrations in males and pregnant females. We analyzed the elution profiles of glucocorticoid and androgen metabolites in 13 samples with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the extent to which androgen metabolites cross-react with our glucocorticoid assay. Males, pregnant females, non-pregnant females, and "high-cort" whales each had distinctly different immunoreactive HPLC profiles of glucocorticoid and androgen metabolites. A major glucocorticoid metabolite was prominent in all "high-cort" whales including the fatally entangled whale. The major fecal androgen was not testosterone but was instead a more nonpolar steroid (possibly dihydrotestosterone), which may be diagnostic of males. Androgen metabolites showed only minor cross-reactivity to our glucocorticoid assay, having a slight influence on glucocorticoid results in particular individuals. We conclude that fecal glucocorticoid analysis appears to be a useful measure of adrenal activity and reproductive condition for NARW. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The comment by Romero and Kannada is presented as a critique of our previous work and suggests that our conclusions are in direct conflict with the historic whaling information reviewed in their paper. However, the critique is based on a misinterpretation of the geographical, temporal, and taxonomic focus of our previous work. The source of the putative conflict appears to stem from the misinterpretation that our results, focused solely on the impact of Basque whaling in the 16th and 17th centuries on the western North Atlantic right whale, were intended to be representative of all whaling of both right and bowhead whales throughout the North Atlantic. To demonstrate this, we briefly review our original results and conclusions and show that the information reviewed by Romero and Kannada does not challenge any aspect of our original work. As such, their comment is not a critique of our paper, but rather a brief review of the history of whaling in the North Atlantic. © 2006 NRC.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale (NARW) is one of the most endangered great whales. The NARW population consists of only about 300 individuals and is reproducing at an insufficient rate. There is growing concern about the potential effects of environmental contaminants on the reproductive and overall health of NARW. High contaminant burdens can accumulate in tissues of great whales but toxicological studies of their effects are limited due to legal, logistical and ethical restrictions and specific in vitro models are critically needed. Cell lines from NARW skin and internal organs were previously created in our laboratory. In this study, skin, testis and lung primary fibroblast cell lines were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BP) as part of a multi-chemical toxicity testing project in NARW. Cells were exposed for 24-72 h to 10 nM-10 μM BP dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. Cytotoxicity was measured with a clonogenic assay using standard methods. Some cytotoxicity was observed after 24 h, the highest concentration (10 μM BP) resulting in 77, 74 and 51 percent relative survival in testis, skin and lung cells, respectively, and indicating a higher cytotoxicity in the lung (p < 0.05). After 48 and 72-h exposure, 10 μM BP resulted in 24 and 3, 74 and 27, and 42 and 23 percent relative survival in testis, skin and lung cells, respectively. Cytotoxicity significantly increased with exposure time in all three tissues (p < 0.05 for skin and p < 0.01 for lung and testis), suggesting metabolic activation of BP in the three organs. Fibroblast cytotoxicity observed in the testis was higher than that observed either in the skin or lung after 48 h (p < 0.01) and was close to 100% after 72 h, warranting further investigation of the potential effects of PAHs on reproductive health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale, a seriously endangered species, is found in Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts, USA) during the winter and early spring. During their residency in these waters, these whales are frequently observed feeding. This study evaluated spatial and temporal changes in the chemical composition (carbon weight and C/N ratio) of the food resource targeted by the right whales in Cape Cod Bay. The three taxa measured (Centropages typicus, Pseudocalanus spp., and Calanus finmarchicus) had highly variable chemical compositions resulting from the different life strategies and from fluctuations in their surrounding environment. The impact of seasonal variability in the energy densities of the food resource of right whales was calculated and compared to the energetic requirements of these whales. Calculations indicated that differences in the nutritional content of the zooplankton prey in Cape Cod Bay could have a considerable effect on the nutrition available to the right whales. Therefore, it is likely that using more precise estimates of the energetic densities of the prey of right whales would lead to a re-evaluation of the adequacy of the food resource available to these whales in the North Atlantic. © 2006 The Authors.

abstract={The abrasive impact of commercial fishing gear on right whale fluke tissue was modeled using a reciprocating load generator. A line passing over the leading edge of a fluke specimen was fixed at one end while the other end was loaded in an oscillatory manner. A 24-h abrasion test using an accelerated loading rate of 60 cycles/min and a 9.0-kg load on the fixed end of the most abrasive line tested (old sink line) was used to simulate a whale swimming 2 m/s towing four standard lobster buoys for five days. A tension load of 267 N was generated on the oscillatory side of the fluke. The test line failed to break the skin on the fluke but, instead, produced a compression furrow (maximum depth 0.31 cm) that closely resembled marks found on stranded right (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. Different line types (float vs. sink) and ages of rope (new vs. old) produced furrows of varying depths and appearances. Further tests characterizing whale skin/fishing line interactions will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern entanglement injuries and provide a framework for better forensic analysis and interpretation of gear-related injuries observed in large whales. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Standardized aerial surveys were used to document the winter (December-March) distribution of North Atlantic right whales in their calving area off the coasts of Georgia and northeastern Florida (1991-1998). Survey data were collected within four survey zones in and adjacent to federally designated critical habitat. These data, including whale-sighting locations and sampling effort, were used to describe right whale distribution in relation to sea-surface temperature (SST) from satellite-derived images. Locations where whales were sighted (n= 609) had an overall mean SST of 14.3°C ± 2.1°(range 8°-22°C). Data from two survey zones having sufficient data (including the "early warning system" (EWS) zone and the Florida nearshore) were pooled by season and stratified by month to investigate changes in monthly ambient SST and fine-scale distribution patterns of right whales in relation to SST within spatially explicit search areas. Using Monte Carlo techniques, SSTs and latitudes (means and standard deviations) of locations where whales were sighted were compared to a sampling distribution of each variable derived from daily-search areas. Overall, results support a nonrandom distribution of right whales in relation to SST: during resident months (January and February), whales exhibited low variability in observed SST and a suggested southward shift in whale distribution toward warmer SSTs in the EWS zone; while in the relatively warmer and southernmost survey zone (Florida nearshore), right whales were concentrated in the northern, cooler portion. Our results support that warm Gulf Stream waters, generally found south and east of delineated critical habitat, represent a thermal limit for right whales and play an important role in their distribution within the calving grounds. These results affirm the inclusion of SST in a multivariate predictive model for right whale distribution in their southeastern habitat. © 2006 by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.},

abstract={New sightings and some strandings extend the first evaluation of the cetacean fauna established in 1989 for the Kerguelen Islands. Stranding data reveal the presence of two new species (Ziphius cavirostris and Hyperoodon planifrons) in addition to the nine previously identified (Eubalaena glacialis, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus, Mesoplodon layardii, Lagenorhynchus cruciger, Cephalorhynchus commersonii, Orcinus orca, and Globicephala melas). The occasional occurrence of Phocoena dioptrica is confirmed. Since 1989, the most important result is the large number of sightings (n=1649) of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) beyond the Kerguelen Island plateau, in an area rarely visited by fishing boats in the past. For the most common species, Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), distributional data are supplemented by biological and ecological informations. For three species (Physeter macrocephalus, Orcinus orca and Globicephala melas) we provide evidence of interactions with the longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.},

abstract={Intensive study of the highly endangered western North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis over the past 25 yr has yielded evidence of reproductive dysfunction and compromised health, particularly in the late 1990s. Among the factors identified as potentially contributing to this phenomenon, exposure to marine biotoxins associated with harmful algal blooms has received little consideration. We assessed the occurrence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins (saxitoxin [STX] analogues) in E. glacialis and in the co-occurring zooplankton assemblage dominated by Calanus finmarchicus, the primary food for this whale species in the North Atlantic. Samples of E. glacialis feces collected during August/September 2001 from at least 11 different whales in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, tested positive for PSP toxins using a receptor binding assay and were also quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, indicating concentrations as high as 0.5 μg STX equivalents g-1 of feces. Zooplankton samples collected in the Bay of Fundy during the same period contained similar levels of PSP toxins by weight using both methods. Additional data from the Bay of Fundy revealed the presence of PSP toxin-producing dinoflagellates, Alexandrium spp., immediately before and during the sampling period. Associated PSP toxin levels in shellfish from nearby Cheney Passage, New Brunswick, exceeded regulatory limits over the same time frame. These findings provide direct evidence for the occurrence of PSP toxins in E. glacialis and suggest that trophic transfer of marine algal toxins is a factor contributing to the failure of the endangered North Atlantic right whale population to recover. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={Annual and seasonal trends in sightings of coastal cetaceans near Halifax, Nova Scotia, were studied using observations from whale watching and dedicated research vessels from late spring to early fall of 1996 to 2005. Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis experienced decreased reproduction and body condition in the 1990s, causing concern about the overall health of this critically endangered population. Images from a detailed photo-identification catalog of right whales were analyzed for the presence of skin lesions. Lesions were categorized as white lesions or blister lesions and each of those categories were further divided based on lesion morphology and location. Of 439 whales photo-analyzed between 1980 and 2002, white lesions were detected on 227 ind. (51.7%) and blister lesions were found on 76 ind. (17.3 %). The majority of white lesions (72.8 %) were detected in the Bay of Fundy where their prevalence increased dramatically during the 1990s (peaking at 40 and 41 % of all identified whales in 1997 and 1999, respectively). A correlation between whale density and white lesions in the Bay of Fundy suggested that this lesion type may have been the result of a contagious agent, though the data on mother/calf pairs did not indicate transmission from mother to calf. Blister lesions appeared at low levels throughout the population over the study period. Neither lesion category was more prevalent on males or females, nor were there any differences between adults and juveniles. One white lesion type appeared exclusively on whales that had been entangled, and whose subsequent survival was in most cases questionable. This is the first detailed analysis of skin lesions in this species. Only 1 tissue sample has been previously obtained from a lesion, and thus the histology and etiology of these lesions remain unknown. Further work is needed to explore the role of disease and environmental variables in lesion prevalence. © Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract={Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. are protozoan parasites that are often associated with severe diarrheal disease in a variety of mammals. Although these parasites have been extensively studied in terrestrial ecosystems, little is known about either parasite in the marine environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of both Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. in 5 marine mammal species. Fecal samples were collected from 39 bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), 49 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), 31 ringed seals (Phoca hispida), 22 bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), and 18 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) between 1998 and 2003. Using an immunofluorescent assay, parasites were detected in the feces of bowhead whales, right whales, and ringed seals, while neither parasite was detected in samples from bearded seals or beluga whales. Overall, prevalences were highest in ringed seals (Cryptosporidium spp., 22.6%; Giardia spp., 64.5%) and right whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 24.5%; Giardia spp., 71.4%) and lowest in bowhead whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 5.1%; Giardia spp., 33.3%). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. in either whale species and of Cryptosporidium spp. in the ringed seal. © American Society of Parasitologists 2005.},

abstract={Right whales carry large populations of three 'whale lice' (Cyamus ovalis, Cyamus gracilis, Cyamus erraticus) that have no other hosts. We used sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI gene to ask (i) whether cyamid population structures might reveal associations among right whale individuals and subpopulations, (ii) whether the divergences of the three nominally conspecific cyamid species on North Atlantic, North Pacific, and southern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis, Eubalaena japonica, Eubalaena australis) might indicate their times of separation, and (iii) whether the shapes of cyamid gene trees might contain information about changes in the population sizes of right whales. We found high levels of nucleotide diversity but almost no population structure within oceans, indicating large effective population sizes and high rates of transfer between whales and subpopulations. North Atlantic and Southern Ocean populations of all three species are reciprocally monophyletic, and North Pacific C. erraticus is well separated from North Atlantic and southern C. erraticus. Mitochondrial clock calibrations suggest that these divergences occurred around 6 million years ago (Ma), and that the Eubalaena mitochondrial clock is very slow. North Pacific C. ovalis forms a clade inside the southern C. ovalis gene tree, implying that at least one right whale has crossed the equator in the Pacific Ocean within the last 1-2 million years (Myr). Low-frequency polymorphisms are more common than expected under neutrality for populations of constant size, but there is no obvious signal of rapid, interspecifically congruent expansion of the kind that would be expected if North Atlantic or southern right whales had experienced a prolonged population bottleneck within the last 0.5 Myr. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={1. Focal species warrant conservation attention because they serve keystone, umbrella, indicator or flagship functions, and/or are sensitive or vulnerable to threats. 2. Defining critical habitat requirements for viable populations of focal species could provide important information for marine protected area (MPA) network design, as a complement to other considerations such as habitat representation. 3. A generally applicable approach for selecting focal species based on 20 characteristics that identify species as important in the community and/or susceptible to threats is presented with reference to the Scotia-Fundy region of Atlantic Canada. 4. Although a rigorous quantitative assessment of all local species against these characteristics is not included, several potential focal species are shown to possess many of the characteristics. 5. The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) demonstrates flagship, umbrella and indicator characteristics, and is locally vulnerable to threats. Seasonally important feeding, nursery and socializing areas could be protected within a network of MPAs in the Scotia-Fundy region, which would concurrently protect sympatric species with smaller area requirements. 6. Cold-water corals (i.e. Primnoa resedaeformis, Paragorgia arborea, Lophelia pertusa) possess keystone, indicator and flagship characteristics and are sensitive and vulnerable to local threats; thus, areas of high coral density and/or diversity could be protected within an MPA network, which would also help protect associated species. 7. These examples illustrate how consideration of the characteristics can help identify focal species and how their life requisites may be applied to MPA network design. 8. Rigorous quantitative assessment of all local species is required to select a comprehensive suite of focal species, and further research is needed to fill data gaps and confirm underlying hypotheses. 9. Nonetheless, focal species considerations show promise as a complement to other approaches to MPA network design and thus warrant further exploration in the Scotia-Fundy region and elsewhere.

abstract={The surface active group (SAG) is the most commonly observed surface social behavior of North Atlantic right whales. Recordings were made from 52 SAGs in the Bay of Fundy, Canada between July and September, from 1999 to 2002. The call types recorded from these groups were similar to those described previously for Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), with six major call types being termed scream, gunshot, blow, upcall, warble, and downcall. The percentage of total calls of each call type depended on the group size and composition. The most common call type recorded was the scream call. The scream calls were produced by the focal female in a SAG. Production of other sound types can be attributed to whales other than the focal female, with gunshot and upcalls produced by males, and warble calls produced by female calves. The source levels for these sounds range from 137 to 162 dB rms re 1 μPa-m for tonal calls and 174 to 192 dB rms for broadband gunshot sounds. © 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Satellite-monitored radio tags were attached to North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in Grand Manan Basin of the lower Bay of Fundy during the summer and early fall seasons of 1989-1991 and 2000. Monte Carlo tests were used to examine the distribution of the tagged whales in space and time and with respect to a variety of environmental variables to characterize right whale habitat on their northern feeding grounds. These environmental variables included depth, depth gradient, climatological surface and bottom hydrographic properties, and remotely sensed surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and their respective horizontal gradients. Site fidelity in the Bay of Fundy was very low during 1989-1991 and high during 2000. When the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundances of their primary copepod prey, Calanus finmarchicus, are thought to be high. Instead, right whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification. No evidence was found that the tagged right whales associated with oceanic fronts or regions with high standing stocks of phytoplankton. © 2005 NRC Canada.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) make a short, distinctive broadband sound that is produced internally called a Gunshot sound. This sound has been recorded in the Bay of Fundy, Canada from both single whales (n = 9) and social surface active groups (n = 49). Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n = 9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Long-term studies of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, have revealed declining reproductive parameters over the past two decades, threatening recovery of this small population if current trends continue. Little is known about right whale reproductive physiology, and investigating this reproductive decline has been limited by a lack of non-lethal methods for assessing reproductive status (e.g., sexual maturation, ovarian activity, pregnancy, lactation, and reproductive senescence) in free-swimming whales. This paper describes validation of existing radioimmunoassay techniques to study reproduction in right whales by measuring estrogens, progestins, androgens, and their related metabolites in fecal samples. Over the past decade fecal steroid hormone assays have been used to assess reproductive status and function in a wide range of terrestrial wildlife species, but this is the first application of this methodology in wild cetaceans. Analysis of fecal hormone metabolite levels in combination with life history data from photographically identified whales shows that this non-invasive method can be used to determine gender, detect pregnancy and lactation, and to assess age at sexual maturity in right whales and potentially other endangered whale populations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Interactions between marine mammals and fishing gear are an issue of global concern. Entanglements in the western North Atlantic are a major source of injury and mortality for endangered large whales. In this study, entanglements of 31 right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 30 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were analyzed to determine the types and parts of gear involved. When gear was identified, 89% (n = 32) of the entanglements were attributed to pot and gill net gear; however, a wide range of specific gear types were implicated. Despite gear recovery, gear type was not identified in 20% (n = 9) of the cases. Although pot gear was recovered from both species equally, gill net gear was less frequently retrieved from right whales (n = 2) than humpback whales (n = 11). When gear part was identified, 81% (n = 21) involved entanglements in buoy line and/or groundline. For right whales, the most common point of gear attachment was the mouth (77.4%); for humpback whales, the tail (53%) and the mouth (43%) were common attachment sites. Four right and three humpback whales in this sample were known to have died subsequent to entanglement. However, when identified, the gear types and parts involved in lethal cases were not substantially different from entanglements with non-lethal outcomes. Large whales can become entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear types and parts, and additional insight will depend on continued efforts to document entanglements and recover associated gear. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract={Few data exist on the marine distribution and host organisms of the parasitic sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. Some observers have speculated that cetaceans serve as hosts for these fish based on scars, but few lamprey - cetacean interactions have been described in detail in the literature. Here we discuss 35 previously unreported records of sea lampreys that were observed while attached to western North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, during the period 1984 - 2002. Of these observations, 11 were photographically documented with images of sufficient quality to identify the lamprey as P. marinus based on morphological characteristics. The majority of the attachments were recorded in the Bay of Fundy during the summer months when P. marinus are preparing to spawn. It is unknown how lampreys might benefit from this association or what cost may be incurred by their right whale hosts. Feeding and transport are two possible reasons for the attachments.},

abstract={Survival probability is of interest primarily as a component of population dynamics. Only when survival estimates are included in a demographic model are their population implications apparent. Survival describes the transition between living and dead. Biologically important as this transition is, it is only one of many transitions in the life cycle. Others include transitions between immature and mature, unmated and mated, breeding and non-breeding, larva and adult, small and large, and location x and location y. The demographic consequences of these transitions can be captured by matrix population models, and such models provide a natural link connecting multi-stage mark-recapture methods and population dynamics. This paper explores some of those connections, with examples taken from an ongoing analysis of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Formulating problems in terms of a matrix population model provides an easy way to compute the likelihood of capture histories. It extends the list of demographic parameters for which maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained to include population growth rate, the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate, the net reproductive rate, generation time, measures of transient dynamics. In the future, multi-stage mark-recapture methods, linked to matrix population models, will become an increasingly important part of demography. © 2004 Museu de Ciències Naturals.},

abstract={The seasonal distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialisis generally well known in coastal areas but poorly known in offshore portions of the species' range. Two main areas of offshore occurrence have been known or suspected, based largely on evidence from 19th century American whaling logbooks: the Cape Farewell Ground east and south-east of the southern tip of Greenland, and 'Maury's Smear', a mid-latitude area bounded by 35 to 43° N and 25 to 48° W. While the modern occurrence of whales on the old Cape Farewell Ground has been demonstrated by recent sightings, this is not the case for Maury's Smear. Moreover, by examination of original sources we provide direct evidence that the offshore distribution illustrated by Maury in 1852 and 1853 was at least partly and possibly entirely erroneous, based on faulty data extraction and transcription procedures. Our results cast doubt on Maury's charts of 19th century whale distribution more generally, leading us specifically to question the reliability of his depictions of right whale occurrence in offshore portions of other ocean basins.},

abstract={The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), is one of the world's most endangered large cetaceans. It is widely believed that Basque whalers caused the most dramatic decline of this species in the western North Atlantic during the early-16th and 17th centuries. Previous osteological analysis of 17 historic bones suggested that 50% of the Basque harvest consisted of right whales and 50% of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. This 50:50 ratio has been used to estimate pre-exploitation population size, which has subsequently formed the basis of recovery goals and plans for the North Atlantic right whale. Genetic analysis of 21 bones, 13 identified as right whales and 8 as bowhead whales through osteological examination, indicates that in fact only 1 bone was a right whale and 20 were bowhead whales. Additionally, preliminary microsatellite analyses of this specimen are not consistent with the hypothesis that whaling resulted in the low genetic variation found in this species today. These results differ from what would be expected based on any previous view of Basque whaling, and raise questions regarding the impact of Basque whaling on this species. © 2004 NRC Canada.},

abstract={Both species of northern right whale (North Atlantic, Eubalaena glacialís and North Pacific, Eubalaena japonica) are critically endangered. The overall distribution of these small, migratory populations is not well known, especially outside of summer. Passive acoustic monitoring is a tool that could provide information on locations of whales. Better distributional information will inform management efforts to reduce anthropogenic mortalities caused by both ship strikes and fisheries interactions. Recent research on passive acoustic monitoring is summarised, focusing on developments relevant to detection and classification of right whale calls. Some outstanding research requirements are outlined, including the need for the development of models to investigate the potential for risk reduction from acoustic data. Buoys capable of fully automatic whale vocalisation detection, classification and transmission to shore are currently under development.},

abstract={A novel method of detection and classification for marine mammals is presented which uses techniques from independent component analysis to solve the blind source separation problem for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). Using the fundamentally non-Gaussian nature of marine mammal vocalizations and data collected on multiple hydrophones, we are able to separate right whale source spectra, up to an unknown scale, from ambient noise. This technique assumes that the array data is a linear combination of non-Gaussian source signals but does not require specific knowledge of the array geometry. A detection algorithm which separates right whale vocalizations from ambient background using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is presented and tested on data collected in the Bay of Fundy. The performance of the detector was found to be such that it was possible to achieve a probability of detection of about three-fourths with a false alarm probability of about one-third. Independent component analysis was found to provide little improvement over standard principle component analysis, which was used as preprocessing step.},

abstract={North Atlantic, North Pacific, and southern right whales all produce the up call, a frequency-modulated upsweep in the 50-200 Hz range. This call is one of the most common sounds, and frequently the most common sound, received from right whales, and as such is a useful indicator of the presence of right whales for acoustic surveys. A data set was prepared of 1857 calls and 6359 non-call sounds recorded from North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) near Georgia and Massachusetts. Two methods for the detection of the calls were compared: spectrogram correlation and a neural network. Spectrogram correlation parameters were chosen two ways, by manual choice using a sample of 20 calls, and by an optimization procedure that used all available calls. Neural network weights were trained via backpropagation on 9/10 of the test data set. Performance was measured separately for calls of different signal-to-noise ratio, as SNR heavily influences the performance of any detector. Results showed that the neural network performed best at this task, achieving an error rate of less than 6%, and is thus the preferred detection method here. Spectrogram correlation may be useful in situations in which a large set of training data is not available, as manual training on a small set of examples achieved an error rate (26%) that may be acceptable for many applications.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales were extensively hunted during the whaling era and have not recovered. One of the primary factors inhibiting their recovery is anthropogenic mortality caused by ship strikes. To assess risk factors involved in ship strikes, we used a multi-sensor acoustic recording tag to measure the responses of whales to passing ships and experimentally tested their responses to controlled sound exposures, which included recordings of ship noise, the social sounds of conspecifics and a signal designed to alert the whales. The whales reacted strongly to the alert signal, they reacted mildly to the social sounds of conspecifics, but they showed no such responses to the sounds of approaching vessels as well as actual vessels. Whales responded to the alert by swimming strongly to the surface, a response likely to increase rather than decrease the risk of collision.},

abstract={With the end of commercial whaling, it was thought that populations of the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) would gradually recover. However, recent modeling studies have shown that the population's growth rate increased gradually during the 1980s, but began declining in the early 1990s, when female mortality rates increased substantially. Demographic projections predict that, assuming birth and mortality rates remain comparable to those observed in the early 1990s, the population will become extinct in less than 200 years. Further extrapolations suggest that reducing mortality rates by a few female deaths per year through conservation efforts would be sufficient to support a slow recovery of the population. However, the effects of climate variability and change on calving rates may make the North Atlantic right whale even more vulnerable than previous projections have suggested. Failure to incorporate the effects of climate in demographic projections may lead us to underestimate the conservation efforts required to ensure recovery of this whale population. © The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Although trends in reproduction, mortality, and entanglement events have been analyzed for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) population, no method has been available to assess individual right whale health. Here, we describe a technique for assessing health based on evaluation of selected physical parameters from archived photographs of right whales. A scoring system was developed to assess body and skin condition, blow-hole cyamids, and rake marks in over 200 000 photographs. Comparison of body condition scores of females during calving and noncalving years found that females were significantly thinner in calving years and in the year after calving compared with the year before calving, showing that changes in body condition known to occur during the reproductive cycle can be successfully evaluated from photographs. Comparison of scores for all parameters between living whales and whales with more than a 5-year gap in sighting history ("presumed dead") found that presumed dead whales received health assessment scores indicating compromised health with body condition emerging as a key visual indicator. This health assessment method provides a new tool to monitor health trends in right whales at individual and population levels and may provide a model for assessments of other well-photographed cetaceans.},

abstract={Temporal variability in the distribution and abundance of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis and their copepod prey, late-stage Calanus finmarchicus, was monitored at an oceanographic station in Grand Manan Basin of the lower Bay of Fundy for 29 h on 2 separate occasions. The vertical distribution of C. finmarchicus was measured at V2 h intervals with an optical plankton counter (OPC) and at 6 or 12 h intervals with a MOCNESS. Right whale abundance was estimated from periodic point scans. Late-stage C. finmarchicus exhibited diel vertical migration in the upper 100 m of the water column, but the bulk of the population remained at depths below 100 m throughout both the day and night and was likely in diapause. Diel vertical migration is unlikely to be influenced by right whales, but may instead be motivated by abundant, near-surface food resources and avoidance of visual predators. Right whale sighting rate was correlated with OPC-detected C. finmarchicus fifth copepodite (C5) abundance at mid-depths (90-140 m); variability in both right whale sighting rate and C. finmarchicus C5 abundance in this depth stratum appeared to have similar periodicity to that of the tide. Energetic considerations suggest that right whales continue to feed on deep, diapausing layers of C. finmarchicus during the night, but the occasional presence of exploitable near-surface concentrations of C. finmarchicus suggests that nighttime near-surface feeding might sometimes occur.},

abstract={Simultaneous visual and oceanographic surveys were conducted in the lower Bay of Fundy and in Roseway Basin of the SW Scotian Shelf during the summers of 1999 to 2001 to investigate the physical and biological oceanographic factors associated with North Atlantic right whale occurrence. Sightings of right whales were recorded along predetermined transects through each region, while both in situ and remotely sensed oceanographic measurements were collected. Sampling with plankton nets and an optical plankton counter confirmed that right whales in these regions feed on Calanus finmarchicus copepodite stage 5 (C5). Spatial variability in right whale occurrence was associated with water depth and the depth of the bottom mixed layer. C. finmarchicus C5 aggregated over the deepest water depths in both regions, and within these areas, right whales occurred where the bottom mixed layer forced discrete layers of C. finmarchicus C5 to occur shallower in the water column (allowing more efficient foraging). Annual increases in right whale occurrence appeared to be associated with decreases in sea surface temperature (SST) in both regions; however, this observation merits caution in light of the short duration of the study (3 yr).

abstract={North Atlantic right whales were instrumented with suction-cup mounted, time-depth recorders (TDR) during the summers of 2000 and 2001 to examine their diving and foraging behavior. Simultaneous observations of temperature, salinity and the vertical distribution of their principal prey, Calanus finmarchicus stage 5 copepodites (C5), were obtained along each whale's track with a conductivity-temperature-depth instrument (CTD) and an optical plankton counter (OPC). Right whale feeding dives were characterized by rapid descent from the surface to a particular depth between 80 and 175 m, remarkable fidelity to that depth for 5 to 14 min and then rapid ascent back to the surface. The average depth of dive was strongly and positively correlated with both the average depth of peak C. finmarchicus C5 abundance and the average depth of the bottom mixed layer's upper surface. Significantly longer surface intervals were observed for reproductively active females and their calves when compared to other individuals, indicating that this critical segment of the population may be at increased risk of ship strikes owing to their diving behavior. Ingestion rates calculated from TDR and OPC data exceeded estimated daily metabolic requirements for most of the tagged right whales; however, short deployment durations and uncertainty in metabolic rates make it impossible to judge whether individual right whales were obtaining sufficient energy to meet the metabolic costs of reproduction. Improvements in attachment durations and the development of novel methods to estimate the metabolic rates of large whales in situ are required to determine whether right whale reproduction is limited by insufficient food resources.},

abstract={Hydrophone recordings, made in the presence of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Bay of Fundy during the daytime in July 1999, are used to determine the characteristics of the recorded sounds. A spectrogram-based method was implemented to discriminate whale sounds from background noise and the time-frequency envelope of the primary harmonic in the spectrogram was used as the basis for sound characterization. Sounds were typically (82%, n = 45) in the 300- to 600-Hz range with up- and downsweeping modulations. Lower (&lt;200 Hz) and higher (&gt;900 Hz) frequency sounds were relatively rare. Most sounds were frequency modulated, with 95% of the observed instantaneous relative frequency variation being within ±4.5% of the mean peak frequency. Harmonics were observed in 18% of the sounds. The average sound duration was 0.42 s ±0.26 SD. The sounds occurred at a rate of between 0.3 and 0.7 min-1. The time intervals between adjacent sounds (2-700 s) were not randomly distributed. The number of sounds occurring among different waiting times did not reflect a Poisson distribution and a clustering of sounds (2 to 5 cluster-1) was observed. The sound characteristics are compared to those documented elsewhere and as reported for the southern right whale.},

abstract={Southern Right Whales Eubalaena australis are an endangered species that have been recovering from unsustainable whaling practices and, despite being reported along the east and west coasts of Australia, they have not been duly accounted for in recent risk assessments for marine development. This review of the last decade of sightings highlights northerly movements into temperate and sub-tropical waters, indicates that fatal entanglement has occurred and points toward an increasing likelihood of interactions between migrating whales and inshore marine development. Given that entanglements and vessel strike are preventing the recovery of North Atlantic Right Whales Eubalaena glacialis, we recommend a precautionary approach to risk assessment around Australia and the formation of a national animal entanglement committee with both a pre-emptive role in assessing coastal development applications and a reactive role in the event of entanglement.},

abstract={A free-drifting 14-sonobuoy array was used to localize North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Grand Manan Basin area of the Bay of Fundy. This area is a primary summer/autumn right whale habitat and overlaps an international shipping lane. The three-hour deployment on a single day provided two-dimensional localization of 94 right whale sounds based on arrival time differences determined from spectrogram cross-correlation analysis. The sounds were of two distinct types: tonal and gunshot. Maximum detection distances were about 30 km for both types of sound. The mean RMS location error was 1.8 km for tonal-type sounds and 2.5 km for gunshot-type sounds. The average RMS error was 20% of the average distance from the receiving hydrophones, the primary source of error being uncertainty in the sonobuoy positions.},

abstract={The surface active group (SAG) is the most obvious social interaction of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). SAGs are typically composed of an adult female with two or more males engaged in social behavior near the surface. Distinct calls, believed to be produced by the female, are associated with these groups. Calls recorded from three North Atlantic right whale SAGs and three South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) SAGs were played back to North Atlantic right whales to determine if these sounds are sufficient to attract males to the groups. Playbacks of gunshot sounds produced by North Atlantic right whales were used as a control stimulus. Thirty-six trials were carried out from 1999 to 2001 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Whales approached 27 of 31 SAG playbacks and 0 of 5 gunshot playbacks. Where sex was determined (n = 28), all approaches to North Atlantic SAG recordings were by males. Individuals (n = 22) of all age and sex classes approached South Atlantic SAG playbacks. These trials indicate that SAG calls from both populations are sufficient to attract tight whales to SAGs and that males and females respond differently to stimuli from the North Atlantic. The difference in response to North and South Atlantic SAG stimuli was unexpected. Novelty, species differences in calls, and different seasonal or behavioral context for the recorded stimuli may be responsible for the differences in response.},

abstract={Definitive studies on the response of marine mammals to anthropogenic sound are hampered by the short surface time and deep-diving lifestyle of many species. A novel archival tag, called the DTAG, has been developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment. Several deployments have included sound playbacks to the tagged whale and a transient response to at least one playback is evident in the tag data.},

This tag uses FLASH memory in place of moving magnetic tape or disks to record data and so can be encapsulated in plastic. A low-power digital signal processor combines audio, acquired from a hydrophone, with sensor measurements, and streams the data to the nonvolatile memory array. The sensor suite comprises acceleration, magnetic field, and pressure sensors and is tailored to measuring orientation at sampling rates of up to 50 Hz, much higher than traditional time–depth recorders.},

abstract={Multi-stage mark-recapture (MSMR) statistics provide the best method for estimating the transition probabilities in matrix population models when individual capture history data are available. In this paper, we improve the method in four major ways. We use a Markov chain formulation of the life cycle to express the likelihood functions in matrix form, which makes numerical calculations simpler. We introduce a method to incorporate capture histories with uncertain stage and sex identifications, which allows the use of capture history data with incomplete information. We introduce a simple function that allows multinomial transition probabilities to be written as functions of covariates (time or environmental factors). Finally, we show how to convert transition probabilities estimated by the MSMR method into a matrix population model. These methods are applied to data on the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis).},

abstract={Commercial exploitation reduced the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) population from c. 12 000 in the 11th century to around 300 by the 21st century. We examine the effect of this population decline on levels of genetic variation at 16 microsatellite loci and contrast levels of variability to that in a closely related species (E. australis). Of the 13 loci developed from the E. glacialis genome, 100% were polymorphic in E. australis. In contrast, nine loci were polymorphic in E. glacialis and four were fixed. Both allelic diversity (A) and heterozygosity (H) were significantly lower in E. glacialis than E. australis (A = 3.2 ± 2.6 vs. A = 6.9 ± 3.3, P < 0.001; H = 0.31 ± 0.25 vs. H = 0.72 ± 0.23, P < 0.001, respectively). Bottleneck anlayses indicate that the population is in mutation-drift equilibrium and that a genetic bottleneck did not occur during the most recent decline (18th-20th centuries). Nevertheless, low frequency alleles are relatively uncommon in E. glacialis, suggesting that genetic variability has been reduced in this population.

abstract={The seriously endangered north Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is regularly exposed to the neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) through feeding on contaminated zooplankton acting as a vector of these dinoflagellate toxins. This chronic exposure occurs during several months each summer while the whales are present on their late summer feeding ground in Grand Manan Basin in the lower Bay of Fundy. Based on estimated ingestion rates, we suggest that these toxins could affect respiratory capabilities, feeding behavior, and ultimately the reproductive condition of the whale population. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are vulnerable to injury and mortality caused by vessel strikes. In an effort to prevent vessel strikes in the southeastern U.S. calving ground, a communication network was implemented to relay right whale sighting information, gathered by aerial survey teams, to mariners in the area. The system, which has evolved substantially since inception, now provides real-time sighting information to the marine community, thus assisting with avoidance of northern right whales. The current system utilizes 25 cloned alphanumeric pagers distributed to various state, federal, military, and industry representatives. Right whale sightings are reported and disseminated via the pagers, and ultimately via Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) to all ships 100 tons or larger in southeastern waters. This system has been successful in alerting mariners to the presence of right whales, however to address the critical management problems confronting this highly endangered species, further research into technological advancements that may assist in the detection of right whales should be encouraged.},

abstract={Ship-strike is a major cause of death for large whales. For the northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) ship-strike is the leading cause of documented deaths. Forward-looking sonar provides one possible solution to this problem. A forward-looking sonar could provide information to the ship operator about the presence and location of large whales ahead of a vessel. This paper documents two sea tests in which target strength data was collected for humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae) and for northern right whales. Results are compared to previously published whale target strengths. Blubber thickness and frequency are used in a reflection coefficient model to explain the differences between the previous results and those presented in this paper.},

abstract={Northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were formerly abundant in the northwestern Atlantic, but by 1900 they had been hunted to near extinction. After the end of commercial whaling the population was thought to be recovering slowly; however, evidence indicates that it has been declining since about 1990 (ref. 1). There are now fewer than 300 individuals, and the species may already be functionally extinct owing to demographic stochasticity or the difficulty of females locating mates in the vast Atlantic Ocean (Allee effect4). Using a data set containing over 10,000 sightings of photographically identified individuals we estimated trends in right whale demographic parameters since 1980. Here we construct, using these estimates, matrix population models allowing us to analyse the causes of right whale imperilment. Mortality has increased, especially among mother whales, causing declines in population growth rate, life expectancy and the mean lifetime number of reproductive events between the period 1980-1995. Increased mortality of mother whales can explain the declining population size, suggesting that the population is not doomed to extinction as a result of the Allee effect. An analysis of extinction time shows that demographic stochasticity has only a small effect, but preventing the deaths of only two female right whales per year would increase the population growth rate to replacement level.},

abstract={A variety of marine mammal species have been shown to conserve energy by using negative buoyancy to power prolonged descent glides during dives. A new non-invasive tag attached to North Atlantic right whales recorded swim stroke from changes in pitch angle derived from a three-axis accelerometer. These results show that right whales are positively buoyant near the surface, a finding that has significant implications for both energetics and management. Some of the most powerful fluke strokes observed in tagged right whales occur as they counteract this buoyancy as they start a dive. By contrast, right whales use positive buoyancy to power glides during ascent. Right whales appear to use their positive buoyancy for more efficient swimming and diving. However, this buoyancy may pose added risks of vessel collision. Such collisions are the primary source of anthropogenic mortality for North Atlantic right whales, whose population is critically endangered and declining. Buoyancy may impede diving responses to oncoming vessels and right whales may have a reduced ability to manoeuvre during free ascents. These risk factors can inform efforts to avoid collisions.},

abstract={Although collisions with motorized ships are a recognized source of whale mortality, little has been done to compile information on the frequency of their occurrence or contributing factors. We searched historical records and computerized stranding databases for evidence of ship strikes involving great whales (i.e., baleen whales and the sperm whale). Historical records suggest that ship strikes fatal to whales first occurred late in the 1800s as ships began to reach speeds of 13-15 kn, remained infrequent until about 1950, and then increased during the 1950s-1970s as the number and speed of ships increased. Of 11 species known to be hit by ships, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are struck most frequently; right whales (Eubalaena glacialis and E. australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whales (Physeter catodon), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are hit commonly. In some areas, one-third of all fin whale and right whale strandings appear to involve ship strikes. To assess contributing factors, we compiled descriptions of 58 collisions. They indicate that all sizes and types of vessels can hit whales; most lethal or severe injuries are caused by ships 80 m or longer; whales usually are not seen beforehand or are seen too late to be avoided; and most lethal or severe injuries involve ships travelling 14 kn or faster. Ship strikes can significantly affect small populations of whales, such as northern right whales in the western North Atlantic. In areas where special caution is needed to avoid such events, measures to reduce the vessel speed below 14 kn may be beneficial.},

abstract={We examined six historical specimens of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) using DNA isolated from documented baleen plates from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Sequences from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from these samples were compared with those from a near-exhaustive survey (269 of approximately 320 individuals) of the remaining right whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest that there has been only relatively modest change in maternal lineage diversity over the past century in the North Atlantic right whale population. Any significant reduction in genetic variation in the species most likely occurred prior to the late nineteenth century. One historical specimen was from the last documented female capable of propagating one of the maternal lineages in the population today; no females in the existing population have been found to carry this mtDNA haplotype. Analysis of the only specimens from the eastern North Atlantic right whale population ever to be examined revealed that eastern and western North Atlantic right whales may not have been genetically differentiated populations. Loss of gene diversity experienced by North Atlantic right whales over the last century has been modest, and the six decades of protection have been successful in maintaining much of the maternal lineage diversity that was present in the late nineteenth century.},

abstract={Few studies have examined systematic relationships of right whales (Eubalaena spp.) since the original species descriptions, even though they are one of the most endangered large whales. Little morphological evidence exists to support the current species designations for Eubalaena glacialis in the northern hemisphere and E. australis in the southern hemisphere. Differences in migratory behaviour or antitropical distribution between right whales in each hemisphere are considered a barrier to gene flow and maintain the current species distinctions and geographical populations. However, these distinctions between populations have remained controversial and no study has included an analysis of all right whales from the three major ocean basins. To address issues of genetic differentiation and relationships among right whales, we have compiled a database of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from right whales representing populations in all three ocean basins that consist of: western North Atlantic E. glacialis, multiple geographically distributed populations of E. australis and the first molecular analysis of historical and recent samples of E. glacialis from the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Diagnostic characters, as well as phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, support the possibility that three distinct maternal lineages exist in right whales, with North Pacific E. glacialis being more closely related to E. australis than to North Atlantic E. glacialis. Our genetic results provide unequivocal character support for the two usually recognized species and a third distinct genetic lineage in the North Pacific under the Phylogenetic Species Concept, as well as levels of genetic diversity among right whales world-wide.},

abstract={To elucidate the global distribution and toxicological impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cetaceans, the present study determined the concentrations of individual PCB congeners, including toxic non-ortho (IU-PAC Nos. 77, 126, 169) and mono-ortho (IUPAC Nos. 105, 118, 156) coplanar congeners, in the blubber of 10 species of adult male odontocetes collected from several locations in the North Pacific Ocean and along coastal waters of Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and India during 1985-1997. Total PCB concentrations in cetaceans from temperate and cold waters were higher than those in cetaceans from tropical regions. Residue levels were found to be the highest in Fraser's dolphins collected off Kii Peninsula, Japan, and hump-backed dolphins from Hong Kong, reflecting serious marine pollution by PCBs in industrialized Asian countries. Penta- and hexa-chlorobiphenyls were the predominant PCB congeners, accounting for about 70% of the total PCBs. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs) of non- and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs in the blubber of cetaceans ranged from 36 (in spinner dolphins from the Philippines) to 510 pg/g wet weight (in hump-backed dolphins from Hong Kong). Toxic evaluation of coplanar PCBs using the TEQ concept indicates an greater impact on cetaceans from mid-latitudes. Toxicity contribution of mono-ortho congener IUPAC 118 was prominent in species from high latitude oceans, such as the Bering Sea and the North Pacific, whereas non-ortho congener IUPAC 126 accounted for the highest contribution in cetaceans from lower latitude regions, such as the Philippines and India. The estimated TEQ concentrations in the blubber of some cetacean species, such as northern right whale dolphin and Pacific white-sided dolphin from the northern North Pacific, Dall's porpoise from the Japan Sea, striped dolphin off Sanriku and Fraser's dolphin off Kii Peninsula, Japan, hump-backed dolphin and finless porpoise from Hong Kong, exceeded the levels associated with immunosuppression in harbour seals.},

abstract={Exposure to toxicants is one factor hypothesized to influence population growth of the northern right whale. Organochlorines in right whale skin, feces, and prey were measured and used to identify factors influencing exposure and bioaccumulation. Concentrations of 30 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5.7 ± 8.9 μg/g lipid) and 20 pesticides (11.4 ± 15.4 μg/g lipid) in skin biopsies were consistent with other baleenopterids. Concentrations in feces and prey were two orders of magnitude less than in biopsies. In principal component analysis, organochlorines in biopsies matched those from Bay of Fundy, Canada, zooplankton, whereas feces were like Cape Cod, USA, copepods. Year of biopsy collection was the principal factor associated with differential accumulation of nonmetabolizable PCBs, 4,4'-DDE, and dieldrin. Biopsies collected during winter had lower concentrations of lipid and metabolizable compounds than biopsies collected during summer. Concentrations of metabolizable PCBs increased with age in males. The bioaccumulation patterns implied that blubber burdens change annually because of the ingestion of different prey or prey from distinct locations and the release of some organochlorines stored in blubber during lipid depletion in winter. Because biopsy concentrations were lower than those found in marine mammals affected by PCBs and DDTs, we do not have evidence that the endangered whales bioaccumulate hazardous concentrations of organochlorines.},

abstract={North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are known to spend the majority of the year between the Great South Channel southeast of Cape Cod, and the Nova Scotian shelf. We examined sightings of right whales on and around Jeffreys Ledge, a 54-km-long glacial deposit off the coast of northern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Sightings on Jeffreys Ledge were extracted from three data sets: (1) a systematic survey of the entire northeastern continental shelf between 1979 and 1982, (2) whale-watch and research-cruise sighting data from 1984 to 1997, and (3) a collaborative database of sightings collected by organizations conducting right whale research and all other available sources. Each database supported two seasonal sighting peaks. During summer (especially July and August) sightings were primarily of mother-calf pairs. Several cow-calf pairs were seen over several days to weeks. Several females were resighted in more than one year, but only when calves were present. During October, November, and December, sightings included all age classes, surface-feeding behavior was frequently observed, and some animals were resighted over several weeks. Given the relatively reduced sighting effort during fall, this number of sightings is surprising. During the 20 yr of observations, 52 of 374 photo-identified North Atlantic right whales (13.9%) were seen at least once on Jeffreys Ledge. We suggest that Jeffreys Ledge may be a more important right whale habitat than previously believed, and that it may play an important role in annual movements and distribution of this population.},

abstract={DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of 180 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 16 South Atlantic right whales (E. australis) have been determined using a combination of direct DNA sequencing and single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Five haplotypes were found in E. glacialis, and 10 in E. australis, but none were shared, supporting the reproductive isolation and separate species status of the North and South Atlantic right whales. One haplotype in E. glacialis was found in only three males born before 1982 and this matriline will likely be lost soon. The nucleotide diversity estimates for the five North Atlantic right whale haplotypes was 0.6% and 2.0% for the 10 haplotypes found in the South Atlantic right whales. The average haplotypic diversity was 0.87 in E. glacialis and 0.96 in E. australis, which is consistent with other studies showing a lower level of genetic variation in the North Atlantic right whale. Phylogenetic analysis identified two major assemblages of haplotypes in E. australis from the samples collected from Peninsula Valdes, suggesting a mixing of two historically divergent populations. Using genetic distance measurements with a divergence rate of 0.5%-1.0%/myr, we estimate E. glacialis diverged from E. australis 3-12.5 mya.},
