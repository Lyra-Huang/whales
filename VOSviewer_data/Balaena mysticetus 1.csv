Bowhead whale songs were detected almost continuously in the Chukchi Sea between October 30, 2007 and January 1, 2008 and twice from April 16 to May 5, 2008 during a long-term deployment of five acoustic recorders moored off Point Lay and Wainwright, AK, between October 21, 2007 and August 3, 2008. Two complex and four simple songs were detected. The complex songs consisted of highly stereotyped sequences of four units. The simple songs were primarily made of sequences of two to three moan types whose repetition patterns were constant over short periods but more variable over time. Multiple song types were recorded simultaneously and there is evidence of synchronized song variation over time. The implications of the spatiotemporal distribution of song detection with respect to the migratory and mating behavior of western Arctic bowheads are discussed. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic detection; Chukchi Sea; Mating behavior; Short periods; Spatiotemporal distributions; Acoustics; animal behavior; Arctic; article; autumn; bowhead whale; mating; music; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; sea; sound detection; winter; Acoustics; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bowhead Whale; Electronics; Environment; Ice; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal",,"Ice",,,"Shell Exploration and Production Company","This work was funded by Shell Exploration and Production Co.

Cetaceans include approximately 84 species. They are a diverse group. They range in size from less than 1 m long for a newborn vaquita (. Phocoena sinus), to 33 m in an adult blue whale (. Balaenoptera musculus); they occupy water ranging in temperature from -2°C to over 30°C; they exhibit a diverse array of life history strategies. Consider the sperm whale (. Physeter macrocephalus), which can remain beneath the water for over an hour and dive to depths of several thousand meters; the Ganges river dolphin (. Platanista gangetica), which inhabits fresh water so turbid it is functionally blind; beaked whales of the genus Mesoplodon, which are so pelagic and so elusive that some have never been seen alive in the wild; the gray whale (. Eschrichtius robustus), which annually migrates some 15,000 to 20,000 km between breeding and feeding areas; and the bowhead whale (. Balaena mysticetus), which uses its rostrum to break ice in the Arctic. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The Inuit diet relied upon meat and blubber from whales, seals, and polar bears (. Ursus maritimus). Caribou meat was eaten with seal oil or whale oil. Inland Inuit relied upon traded seal oil for a critical part of their dietary intake. Skins for boats came from seals and walruses. These, along with caribou and birds, also provided skins for clothing. Whale and seal oil provided fuel for lamps, the only source of heat other than body heat in houses. Alaskan coastal kitchens were separate from the houses and typically had two cooking areas, one fueled by oil, and the other by driftwood. Inuit represent one extreme of the hunter-gatherer paradigm, relying almost exclusively on hunting to thrive in one of the Earth's harshest environments, the Arctic. Most Inuit hunting has focused on marine mammals, with the bowhead whale (. Balaena mysticetus) making up a central part of the harvest, particularly in the Western and Eastern Arctic coastal areas. Whaling was important to Inuit from Alaska to Greenland and underwrote the formation and survival of permanent sedentary villages on Alaska's Arctic coast. When whaling was not feasible, Inuit depended upon caribou (. Rangifer tarandus) and other marine mammals. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The advantage of genetic analyses is that data are easier to collect and few constraints are put on the quality of a sample or its origin. DNA is a relatively tough molecule, and adequate samples can be obtained from tiny amounts of a variety of tissues such as skin, blood or bloodstains, hair follicles, placenta, excrement, baleen, modern or ancient bone, or in some circumstances, formalin-preserved tissues. For instance, adequate amounts of mtDNA from ca. 1000-year-old bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) bones have been obtained. More recent historical samples of bone and baleen from St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea have been used for both mtDNA and SNP analysis. Management-oriented genetic studies use primarily (1) genotypes from microsatellite loci within the 3×109 or so base pairs (bp) of the mammalian nuclear genome or (2) DNA sequence data from a portion of the 1.6×104 bp of the mitochondrial genome; the subsequence is also known as a haplotype. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA is a multicopy, circular, cytoplasmic DNA that in marine mammals is inherited intact from the mother. In contrast, microsatellites are part of the nuclear genome and are inherited biparentally. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Bowheads have never occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. Bowheads are readily identifiable by their large size, rotund shape, lack of a dorsal fin, dark color, white chins, triangular head (in profile), and neck (an indentation between the head and back). They are predominantly black, but most have characteristic white patterns on their chins, undersides, around their tail stocks, and on their flukes. These patterns distinguish them from the similar-appearing right whales (. Eubalaena spp.) and are unique to each individual. The white portions of the pattern around the tail and on the flukes increase in extent with age. Most bowheads accumulate distinctive, permanent marks on their backs, perhaps resulting from contact with sea ice or the sea floor when feeding. These huge marine mammals are among the largest animals on earth, weighing up to 75-100 tons. Males grow to 14-17 m in length and females 16-18 m, perhaps as long as 20 m. Their flukes are 2-6 m across. The head constitutes over a third of the bulk of the body, and the baleen may reach lengths of 4 m (no other whale has baleen longer than 2.8 m) with 230-360 plates on each side of the mouth, making the capacious mouth quite possibly the largest of any animal ever. To insulate them from the icy water, bowheads are wrapped in blubber 5.5-28 cm thick covered by an epidermis up to 2.5 cm thick. This combination of blubber and skin is the thickest of any whale species. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To maximize the volume of prey acquired in a dive with limited oxygen supplies, balaenids must either filter feed only occasionally when prey density is particularly high, or they must swim at slow speeds while filtering to reduce drag and oxygen consumption. Using digital tags with three-axis accelerometers, we studied bowhead whales feeding off West Greenland and present here, to our knowledge, the first detailed data on the kinematics and swimming behaviour of a balaenid whale filter feeding at depth. Bowhead whales employ a continuous fluking gait throughout the bottom phase of foraging dives, moving at very slow speeds (less than 1 m s -1), allowing them to filter feed continuously at depth. Despite the slow speeds, the large mouth aperture provides a water filtration rate of approximately 3 m3 s-1, amounting to some 2000 tonnes of water and prey filtered per dive. We conclude that a food niche of dense, slow-moving zooplankton prey has led balaenids to evolve locomotor and filtering systems adapted to work against a high drag at swimming speeds of less than 0.07 body length s-1 using a continuous fluking gait very different from that of nekton-feeding, aquatic predators. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Bowhead whale; Filter feeding; Kinematics","oxygen; surface water; body size; kinematics; locomotion; oxygen consumption; prey selection; swimming; whale; zooplankton; animal experiment; article; Balaena mysticetus; bowhead whale; breath holding; controlled study; diving; filter feeder; foraging behavior; gait; Greenland; kinematics; locomotion; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; prey; priority journal; swimming; velocity; zooplankton; adaptation; animal; biomechanics; physiology; predation; swimming; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biomechanics; Diving; Predatory Behavior; Swimming; Whales",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,,"Acevedo-Gutiérrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J.

Their traditional whaling cycle reveals strong indivisibility of music, emotions, and place based human identity. To illustrate such integrity of the Iupiat and their culturally critical bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), a search was made for specific ways in which climate change influences Iupiaq spiritual and physical ties with the whale in relation to traditional music making. Traditionally, the Iupiat say that it is the whale who brings them music, thus no whale harvest means no music production. However, when the environment is less predictable, the homeland eroded, place based songs gone, and human-whale integrity threatened, how specifically are these changes manifested in the Iupiat-whale relationship? Providing detailed descriptions of 2005-2006 nalukataq (midsummer whale feasts), this article examines how contemporary Iupiat respond to environmental changes in the emotional and cultural dimensions through their music making. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.",,"cultural identity; cultural tradition; festival; global warming; indigenous population; music; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Ahgeak, M., (2006) Interview, , 18 June 2006.

Since the annual bowhead migration reflects the preference of this species for an ice-edge habitat, fossil bowheads have been used to infer that significant variations in summer sea-ice extent occurred throughout the archipelago during the last 10.5 thousand years. Previous studies have demonstrated that climatic amelioration, concomitant with enhanced meltwater flux from the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet, cleared sea ice from the inter-island channels of the central archipelago, enabling early Holocene bowhead whales to extend beyond the range of contemporary populations. A 10.4 ka BP bowhead whale skull was discovered on Ellef Ringnes Island in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago, 700 km north of its previously reported early Holocene range. Consequently, sea ice along the polar margin of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is inferred to have been less extensive than previously recognized. Both biological evidence and glaciological evidence suggest that this reduction in sea-ice extent was the result of climate forcing, amplified by meltwater-driven outflows from the rapidly retreating marine-based sector of the Innuitian Ice Sheet. Following a reduction of these outflows at ∼9 ka BP, sea-ice conditions worsened, despite ongoing climatic amelioration, preventing additional bowhead whale incursions until -4 ka BP. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Bowhead whale;

It has been suggested that this spring singing behavior is a remnant of the singing during the winter breeding season, though no winter recordings are available. In this study, the authors describe recordings made during the winter and spring months of bowhead whales in Disko Bay, Western-Greenland. A total of 7091 bowhead whale sounds were analyzed to describe the vocal repertoire, the singing behavior, and the changes in vocal behavior from February to May. The vocal signals could be divided into simple (frequency-modulated) calls (n=483), complex (amplitude-modulated) calls (n=635), and song notes (n=5973). Recordings from the end of February to middle of March were characterized by higher call rates with a greater diversity of call types than recordings made later in the season. This study is the first description of bowhead song from the stock in Western-Greenland during both the winter and spring months, and provides support for the hypothesis that song during the winter months contains more song notes than song from the spring making the winter song more variable. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Signal processing; Amplitude modulated; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whales; Breeding season; Frequency modulated; Seasonal changes; Vocal behavior; Vocal repertoire; Ice; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; biodiversity; bowhead whale; controlled study; Greenland; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; winter; Acoustics; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bowhead Whale; Seasons; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"21-04-0391, 21-03-0171","This study was funded by DANCEA, the Danish Research Council for Natural Sciences (Grant No. 21-03-0171 to L.A.M. and Grant No. 21-04-0391 to Torkel Gissel Nielsen, National Environmental Research Institute, Roskilde, Denmark) and the Centre for Sound Communication, University of Southern Denmark supported by the Danish National Research Council.

Polar bear distribution and habitat association should both be reliable signals for environmental perturbation, as the bears respond behaviorally to changes in sea ice extent, the timing and duration of ice formation, and ablation. Polar bears and sea ice conditions were monitored as part of the annual fall bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) aerial survey in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea between 1979 and 2005. Habitats associated with polar bear sightings changed during the study, with fewer bears associated with ice (irrespective of ice type and percent) and more bears associated with land and open water. Large-scale differences were documented for both ice type and percent ice cover, particularly in September. In general, the pattern in September (and to a lesser extent in October) included a reduction in old ice and a concomitant increase in open water. In addition, there was an eastward and landward shift in polar bear sightings. From 1979 to 1987, polar bears were observed primarily on ice along the shelf break near Barrow, whereas from 1997 to 2005, polar bears were observed on barrier islands or along the mainland coast near Kaktovik. The changes in polar bear distribution and habitat association appear to reflect a behavioral response by polar bears to changes in ice (type and percent cover) and in the timing of ice formation and ablation. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aerial survey; Alaska; Alimate change; Arctic; Distribution; Habitat association; Polar bear; Sea ice","aerial survey; bear; behavioral response; ecosystem health; environmental change; environmental indicator; habitat use; polar region; sea ice; spatial distribution; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Carmack, E.C., The role of sea ice and other fresh water in the Arctic circulation (1989) Journal of Geophysical Research, 94, pp. 14485-14498; ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment) (2004) Impacts of A Warming Climate: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment., p. 140. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Agresti, A., Categorical data analysis (2002) Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., , 2nd ed; Amstrup, S.C., Polar bear (2000) The Natural History of An Arctic Oil Field: Development and Biota., pp. 133-157. , Truett, J.C., and Johnson, S.R., eds.

Whales were classified by size and status as calves, small subadults (non-calves < 10 m); large subadults (10-13 m); and adults (> 13 m). Adults include mothers with calves, which were also counted separately. During mid-August to early October of 1982, 1984-86, and 1998-2000, calibrated vertical photography was used to obtain known-scale images of 901 different whales in waters up to 200 m deep between Flaxman and Herschel islands (146° to 139° W) in the central Beaufort Sea. Age composition of the whales photographed over all years of our study was calves 6.2%, small subadults 31.4%, large subadults 33.3%, and adults 29.1%. We found proportionally more subadults and fewer adults than are estimated to be in the overall population, and this result was found both before and after making allowance for reduced effort to obtain photographs early and late in the migration period. Thus parts of the central Beaufort Sea up to 200 m deep appear to be more heavily used by subadult bowheads than by adults in most years. Significant interannual variation existed in length-frequency distributions of whales among years, geographic subdivisions of the study area, water depth categories, and time periods. This variation was due to variable use of the study area by each size class in different years, differences in the water depths used by different size classes, and different migration timing by each size class. In all years, small subadult whales were the dominant group in shallow (< 20 m) nearshore habitats, and the size of the whales increased with increasing water depth. Timing of movements into and through the study area were also related to size class: small subadults arrived first in late August and departed in late September, and adults arrived last in late September. Mothers and calves arrived in early September and were common until at least early October. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Annual variation; Autumn migration; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Date; Feeding; Habitat use; Lengths; Photogrammetry; Productivity; Water depth","age structure; annual variation; autumn; feeding; habitat use; juvenile; migration; photogrammetry; population distribution; summer; water depth; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., and Hobbs, R.C. 1995.

The migration route(s) and wintering area(s) used by this population are largely unknown. Gray whales once had a fairly extensive distribution in the Sea of Okhotsk but little detailed information has been published on when and where they occurred. Open-boat, ship-based whalers from the United States and a few other countries conducted an intensive hunt for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1840s to 1870s. According to entries in voyage logbooks, the American whalers regularly encountered (and sometimes hunted) gray whales in the far northeastern corner of the Okhotsk Sea (Shelikhov Bay, Gizhiginskaya Bay and Penzhinskaya Gulf) between early May-late August. They also observed gray whales in summer along the northern coast of the sea (especially Tauskaya Bay), around the Shantar Islands, in Sakhalin Bay, off Cape Elizabeth at the northern tip of Sakhalin Island and along the west coast of the Kamchatka peninsula. No evidence was found in the logbooks studied of gray whales (and indeed of whaling effort) off northeastern Sakhalin Island where most observations of gray whales occur in the present day.","Bowhead whale; Gray whale; North pacific right whale; Northern hemisphere; Sea of okhotsk; Whaling-historical","endangered species; migration; Northern Hemisphere; open water; population distribution; population structure; seafood; summer; whale; whaling; Eurasia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Sea of Okhotsk; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"(1866) Logbook of the Ship Benjamin Cummings of New Bedford, Charles Halsey, Master. 27 September 1866-1929 November 1869, p. 462. , Benjamin Cummings, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log ODHS; (1866) Logbook of the Ship Benjamin Cummings of New Bedford, Charles Halsey, Master. 27 September 1866-1871 May 1871, , Benjamin Cummings, New Bedford Free Public Library, New Bedford, Massachusetts; Williams, B., (1851) Logbook of the Ship Betsy Williams of Stonington, Gilbert Pendleton, Jr., Master 23 April 1851-1920 April 1854, p. 370. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # KWM; Cicero, (1856) Logbook of the Ship Cicero of New Bedford, Charles Courtney, Master 12 August 1856-1916 May 1860, p. 377. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; Europa, (1866) Logbook of the Ship Europa of Edgartown, Thomas Mellen, Master 29 August 1866-1921 August 1870, p. 663. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; Euphrates, (1857) Logbook of the Ship Euphrates of New Bedford, William H Heath, Master. 15 October 1857-1867 April 1861, p. 384. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1851) Logbook of the Ship Good Return of New Bedford, Benjamin Franklin Wing, Master 2 September 1851-1856 April 1855, p. 794. , Good Return, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1853) Logbook of the Ship Governor Troup of New Bedford, Anthony Milton, Master 1 August 1853-1915 April 1856, p. 829. , Governor Troup, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1863) Logbook of the Ship Josephine of New Bedford.

This study has used aerial photography of bowhead whales during their spring migration near Point Barrow, which has resulted in 5,800 images, primarily from 1984 through 1994. These photographs included 40 different whales seen in at least two years, and of these, two were seen in three different years, making for a pair-wise sample size of 42 matches between years. Differences between dates of initial sightings and subsequent sightings (i.e. resightings) ranged from -31 to +23 days comparing month and day only, irrespective of year. These resightings were well dispersed across most of the bowhead spring migration; 98% of the photographs were taken across 45 days from 19 April through 2 June. Models for predicting resighting date from initial sighting date, whale length, presence of a calf, year of initial sighting and year of subsequent sightings were considered, and the best model was chosen using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The best model included most predictors but did not include initial sighting date. Thus, all of the available evidence indicates that individual mature bowheads do not have a consistent migration timing past Barrow; instead, in subsequent years they may appear on almost any date within the normal migratory period. This wide mixing and near-random distribution of resighting dates throughout the spring migration is indicative of a single stock of whales that have a somewhat plastic schedule.","Arctic; Bowhead whale; Distribution; Migration; North America; Photo-Id","breeding season; identification method; migration; photograph; spatial distribution; spring (season); whale; Alaska; Arctic; North America; Point Barrow; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (1995) Balaena Mysticetus.

Song elements were defined by units following the protocol of previous description of bowhead whale song. The two most prominent songs were loud, complex, and repeated in long bouts on multiple recording days while the third song was much simpler and recorded on only one day. Bowhead whale simple calls and faint song elements were also recorded using digital audio tape recorders and a dipping hydrophone deployed from the sea ice approximately 100-150 km southwest of Disko Bay on three separate days suggesting that song is also produced in the central portion of Baffin Bay in winter. Songs recorded in Disko Bay are from an area where approximately 85% of the whales have been determined to be adult females. Although it is not known which sex was singing, we speculate that, as in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), male bowhead whales may sing to mediate sexual competition or mate selection behaviors.

In 2007 DASARs were deployed at 35 locations over a 280 km swath in the Beaufort Sea, during seismic exploration activities (Fig. 1), in order to monitor potential changes in the animals' location and/or acoustic activity during the seismic activities. The large amount of acoustic data generated (about 50 days per DASAR) motivated the development of computer-aided methods to assist in detecting and classifying bowhead whale calls. Bowhead whale calls can be classified in various ways. Here, we divide calls into six categories: (1) upsweeps, (2) downsweeps, (3) constant calls, (4) u-shaped and (5) n-shaped undulated calls, and (6) complex calls, a catch-all category that covers both frequency-modulated calls with multiple inOections, and amplitude-modulated calls such as warbles, growls, and other such sounds. In addition, walrus and bearded seal calls can produce similar call features in a spectrogram, yielding a total of eight classification categories. The frequency range, duration, and fine structure of individual calls vary considerably even within each category, creating difficulties when using simple matchedfiltering or spectrogram correlation methods. A manually reviewed test dataset was assembled, containing examples from each call category, arranged by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 5 dB bins, ranging from 5 to 40 dB. The dataset was then used to test several methods for extracting relevant parameters from the signal for subsequent classification. Contour tracing methods that estimate frequency bandwidth, inOection points, and duration were examined, as well as other boundary descriptors that utilize standard image segmentation techniques.An optimization procedure was then used to determine appropriate decision boundaries for optimum statistical classifiers.",,"Acoustic activities; Acoustic datum; Amplitude-modulated; Beaufort seas; Contour tracing methods; Data sets; Decision boundaries; Descriptors; Fine structures; Frequency bandwidths; Frequency ranges; Optimization procedures; Potential changes; Seismic activities; Seismic explorations; Signal-to-noise ratios; Spectrogram; Statistical classifiers; U-shaped; Whale calls; Acoustic intensity; Acoustics; Animals; Earthquakes; Environmental engineering; Image processing; Location; Seismic prospecting; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrographs; Spectrum analysis; Statistical tests; Correlation methods",,,,,,,"Greene Jr., C.R., McLennan, M.W., Norman, R.G., McDonald, T.L., Jakubczak, R.S., Richardson, W.J., Directional frequency and recording (DIFAR) sensors in seafloor recorders to locate calling bowhead whales during their fall migration (2004) J.

In this paper a method for estimating the percentage of calves in the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (B-C-B) bowhead whale population in any given year by obtaining information on the percentage of calves passing Point Barrow, Alaska, during the last three weeks of the spring migration is presented. The method incorporates information on the timing of the migration with the percentage of calves detected during calf index surveys conducted during weekly periods from 14 May to early June. Historic data provide the different proportions of the migration during the weekly periods during low, medium and high calf years. The index is adjusted to allow for calves passing before 14 May and calves that are born after their mothers pass Point Barrow. The calf index was calculated for eight years using data from aerial photographic surveys near Point Barrow from 1985 to 2004 and the mean percentage of calves in the sampled years was 6.1 %. Power analyses indicate that nine years of calf index data are required following a decline to detect a 60% reduction in the calf index. Additional calf index surveys prior to a decline would increase the power to detect a decline. This method can provide a robust estimate of the percentage of calves in the population each year with a modest aerial survey or photographic effort at Point Barrow. The data would be valuable in evaluating whether calving rates are within the range tested for the purpose of reviewing the B-C-B bowhead whale Strike Limit Algorithm.","Arctic; Beaufort sea; Birth rate; Bowhead whale; Calves; Chukchi sea; Northern hemisphere; Photogrammetry; Population parameters; Reproduction; Survey-Aerial","demographic survey; juvenile; monitoring; population growth; population modeling; reproductive success; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; Point Barrow; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Rep. int.

The present work combines satellite observations with physical (CTD, currents, tides) and biological (zooplankton sampling) measurements. Data obtained aboard the RV Lugovoe in August-September 2003 and July-August 2004 show dense populations of zooplankton (such as copepods Calanus glacialis, Pseudocalanus sp., pteropods Limacina helicina, and chaetognaths Sagitta sp.) that are concentrated by physical mechanisms within this critically important ecosystem. We show that near-bottom, cold water intrusions from the northern Sea of Okhotsk associated with the estuarine circulation advect arctic herbivorous calanoids (Calanus glacialis) and mollusks Limacina helicina into the region. Satellite and in situ observations that include conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data and measurements of tidal currents are used to study the nature of the estuarine circulation. Results show an anticyclonic circulation, associated with the effect of earth's rotation. An analytical model shows horizontally convergent flows in the lower layer toward the western coast of the bay that push water upward along the steep slope. This together with zooplankton vertical migration leads to aggregation. Thus the combination of the residual eddy formation and swimming behavior act to concentrate zooplankton near the cape and to provide the necessary densities of planktonic food supply for Bowhead whales. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This species occupies subarctic and arctic regions presently undergoing significant ecological change and hydrocarbon development. Thus, understanding the health status of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea (BCBS) stock of bowhead whales is of importance. In this study, we evaluated the concentrations of six essential and non-essential elements (Zn, tHg, Ag, Se, Cu and Cd) in liver and kidney of bowhead whales (n = 64). These tissues were collected from the Inuit subsistence hunt in Barrow, Wainwright and Kaktovik, Alaska between 1983 and 2001. Reference ranges of these elements (including previously reported data from 1983-1997) were developed for this species as part of a health assessment effort, and interpreted using improved aging techniques (aspartic acid racemization and baleen isotopic 13C methods) to evaluate trends over time with increased statistical power. Interactions between element concentrations and age, sex and harvest season were assessed. Age was found to be of highest significance. Sex and harvest season did not effect the concentrations of these elements, with the exception of renal Se levels, which were significantly higher in fall seasons. In addition, histological evaluation of tissues from whales collected between 1998-2001 was performed. Associations between concentrations of Cd in kidney and liver and scored histopathological changes were evaluated. Liver Cd concentration was strongly associated with the degree of lung fibromuscular hyperplasia (P = 0.001) and moderately associated with the degree of renal fibrosis (P = 0.03). Renal Cd concentration influenced the degree of lung fibromuscular hyperplasia and renal fibrosis (P = 0.01). A significant age effect was found for both pulmonary fibromuscular hyperplasia and renal fibrosis, indicating age may be a causative factor. Improvements in aging techniques and the addition of histological indices help clarify the relationships between elements and the influence of life history parameters on concentrations of these elements and potential impacts on health. These data provide essential baseline input useful for monitoring the effects of arctic ecosystem change as it relates to global climate change and industrial development, as well as help inform epidemiological studies examining the public health implications of heavy metals in subsistence foods. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, spatial distribution also appeared to be related to the availability of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) carcasses and the density of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in offshore waters. Our results suggest that long-term reductions in sea-ice could result in an increasing proportion of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear population coming on land during the fall open-water period and an increase in the amount of time individual bears spend on land. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Bear density; Distribution; Polar bears; Sea ice","aerial survey; barrier island; bear; coastal zone; food availability; open water; pinniped; population density; sea ice; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS

We used previous whale age estimates based on aspartic acid racemization (AAR) and corpora counts to extend the use of δ13C data for age determination from cycle counting to a modified exponential model using annual baleen growth increments. Our approach used the growth increment data from individual whales in a nonlinear mixed effects model to assess both population-level and whale-specific growth parameters. Although age estimates from baleen-based models become less precise as the whales age, and baleen growth and length near steady state, the growth increment model shows promise in estimating ages of bowhead whales 10-13.5 m long with baleen lengths &lt;250 cm, where other techniques are less precise or the data are scarce.

To explain euphausiid presence near Barrow, their transport from the northern Bering Sea was investigated through particle tracking experiments using velocity fields from an ocean general circulation model in 4 contrasted circulation scenarios (1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003). Euphausiids were released during their spawning season (April-June) in the bottom and surface layers in the northern Bering Sea, their endemic region, and tracked through the Chukchi-Beaufort Sea. Results show that both Anadyr Gulf and Shpanberg Strait are potential regions of origin for euphausiids. Topographically steered bottom particles have 4 to 5 times higher probability of reaching Barrow than surface particles (ca. 95% versus 20% of particles). As euphausiids are often found near the bottom on the northern Bering shelf, this suggests a very high probability of euphausiids reaching Barrow, making this location a privileged area for whale feeding. The main pathways to Barrow across the Chukchi Sea shelf are Central Valley (CV) and Herald Valley (HV). The transit to Barrow takes 4 to 20 mo. Arrivals at Barrow have 2 peaks at ca. 200 d (fall, CV particles) and 395 d after release (spring, mixed CV and HV) on average, because of the seasonal cycle of the Chukchi Sea currents. Elevated euphausiid abundance in the fall at Barrow is favored by a high Bering Strait northward transport and by southerly winds, driving organisms through CV rather than through the HV pathway. © Inter-Research 2008.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Euphausiid; Lagrangian drifter; Thysanoessa spp.; Western Arctic Ocean; Zooplankton advection model","abundance; advection; crustacean; feeding; feeding behavior; oceanic circulation; seasonal variation; spawning; topography; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Euphausiidae; Thysanoessa",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Roach, A.T., Schumacher, J.D., On the wind-driven variability of the flow through Bering Strait (1985) J Geophys Res, 90, pp. 7213-7221; Astthorsson, O.S., Gislason, A., Biology of euphausiids in the subarctic waters north of Iceland (1997) Mar Biol, 129, pp. 319-330; Berkes F (1976) Ecology of euphausiids in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Before using FA to estimate diets, it is necessary to evaluate variation in FA signatures within and among individuals of a given species. To begin assessing diets and foraging of western Arctic bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), we examined the FA in blubber of 64 bowheads taken in the spring and fall subsistence hunts in 1997-2002 at Barrow and Kaktovik, Alaska. We found no significant differences in FA characteristics of inner blubber layers taken from either duplicate samples on the dorsal surface, or between dorsal and ventral sites. Significant differences were found in the FA composition between inner and outer layers of blubber at the same body site. We also found age, season and year to have significant effects on FA composition; however, gender was not found to be significant. While the importance of the Beaufort Sea as a feeding ground of bowhead whales remains uncertain, our results indicate that adults and sub-adults foraged to some extent on different prey and that both age classes consumed copepods there in summer at sufficient levels to significantly alter their blubber FA profiles. Both of these findings correspond with dietary conclusions reached from the analysis of stomach contents. Furthermore, we found compelling evidence that yearly variation in bowhead FA reflect changes in FA compositions of phytoplankton at the base of the food web, probably in response to climate variation. Variability in phytoplankton-derived FA in blubber was correlated significantly with yearly mean values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. FA in bowhead whale blubber, therefore, might be used to monitor effects of climate change on lower trophic levels and production processes in the western Arctic. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The range in concentrations has not been explained fully by bear age, sex, condition, location, or reproductive status. Dietary pathways expose polar bears to a variety of contaminant profiles and concentrations. Prey range from lower trophic level bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus L., 1758), one of the least contaminated marine mammals, to highly contaminated upper trophic level ringed seals (Phoca hispida (Schreber, 1775)). We used δ15N and δ13C signatures to estimate the trophic status of 42 polar bears sampled along Alaska's Beaufort Sea coast to determine the relationship between organochlorine concentration and trophic level. The δ 15N values in the cellular portions of blood ranged from 18.2% to 20.7%. We found strong positive relationships between concentrations of the most recalcitrant polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and δ15N values in models incorporating age, lipid content, and δ13C value. Specifically these models accounted for 67% and 76% of the variation in PCB153 and oxychlordane concentration in male polar bears and 85% and 93% in females, respectively. These results are strong indicators of variation in diet and biomagnification of organochlorines among polar bears related to their sex, age, and trophic position. © 2008 NRC.",,"bear; diet; organic pollutant; organochlorine; PCB; pinniped; reproductive status; trophic level; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Mammalia; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Abend, A.G., Smith, T.D., Differences in ratios of stable isotopes of nitrogen in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in the western and eastern North Atlantic (1995) ICES J.

Sections on the evolutionary background of pinnipeds and whales help to provide a better perspective on these core species. Polar bears stemmed from brown bears about the Early to Middle Pleistocene. Fossils are rare; the earliest records are from approximately Early Weichselian deposits of Kew Bridge, London, and Svalbard. Existing Pacific and Atlantic walruses probably arose from splitting of a former Holarctic range during a Pleistocene glacial phase of extensive sea ice in the Canadian Arctic. The earliest known bearded seal remains are from Early to Middle Pleistocene deposits of Norfolk, England, and Cape Deceit, Alaska. Other Pleistocene fossils of this species are recorded from the North Sea, southwestern Sweden, and the Champlain Sea that existed in eastern North America approximately 12 000-10 000 BP. The harp seal is the commonest pinniped in the Weichselian deposits of the southern North Sea. The earliest recorded fossil is from about 2 million years ago (2 Ma), from Ocean Point, Alaska. The earliest known Pleistocene ringed seal fossils are from last interglacial deposits near Teshekpuk Lake, Alaska, and Thule, Greenland, although an earlier (3 Ma?) specimen from Malaspina, Alaska, has been reported. This species seems to have been relatively abundant along the coasts of Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, during the Last Glacial Maximum. The bowhead whale probably originated in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The earliest (mid-Wisconsinan) Canadian remains are from Ellesmere and Devon islands. More than 400 radiocarbon-dated bowhead remains have been used to reconstruct Holocene sea ice history in the Canadian Arctic. White whales are common in the late warming stage (approximately 10 500 BP) of the Champlain Sea and are one of the commonest marine mammal fossils in Late Pleistocene North Sea deposits. Fourteen narwhal specimens of Late Glacial or Early Holocene age are known from Atlantic Canada, as well as Ellesmere, Baffin, and Prince of Wales islands in Arctic Canada. Arctic marine mammals have tended to shift to more southerly ranges during glacial phases of the Pleistocene. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Arctic; Holocene; Marine mammal; Pleistocene; Polar bear; Quaternary; Seal; Tertiary; Walrus; Whale","arctic environment; bear; evolution; fossil; Holocene; interglacial; Last Glacial Maximum; late glacial; pinniped; Pleistocene; Weichselian; whale; animal; Arctic; biology; classification; evolution; genetics; mammal; review; Animals; Arctic Regions; Evolution; Mammals; Marine Biology; Alaska; Alexander Archipelago; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Baffin Island; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Cape Deceit; Champlain Sea; Devon Island; Ellesmere Island; England; Eurasia; Europe; Greenland; Lake Teshekpuk; London [England]; Norfolk [England]; North America; North Sea; Nunavut; Prince of Wales Island [Alexander Archipelago]; Queen Elizabeth Islands; Seward Peninsula; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Thule; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Mammalia; Monodon; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus; Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus; Phoca; Phoca groenlandica; Phoca hispida; Pinnipedia; Ursus arctos; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Aaris-Sørensen, K., Petersen, K.S., A Late Weichselian find of polar bear (Ursus maritimus Phipps) from Denmark and reflections on the paleoenvironment (1984) Boreas, 13, pp. 29-33; Árnason, U., Bodin, K., Gullberg, A., Ledje, C., Mouchaty, S., A molecular view of pinniped relationships with particular emphasis on the true seals (1995) Journal of Molecular Evolution, 40, pp. 78-85; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Cytochrome b nucleotide sequences and the identification of five primary lineages of extinct cetaceans (1996) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 13, pp. 407-417; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Kullberg, M., Lehman, N., Petrov, E.A., Väinölä, R., Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal (2006) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 41, pp. 345-354; Bahn, P.G., Vertut, J., (1988) Images of the ice age, , Windward, London, UK; Barnes, L.G., Outline of eastern North Pacific cetacean assemblages (1976) Systematic Zoology, 25, pp. 321-343; Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine mammals: Evolutionary biology, , Academic Press, San Diego, California, USA; Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., Kovacs, K.M., (2006) Marine mammals: Evolutionary biology, , Second edition.

The margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet in Melville Bugt was situated behind its AD 1950-2000 position in the early Holocene, at a similar position to that being reached following rapid retreat in recent years. Such an early deglaciation of areas close to the Greenland Ice Sheet is unusual. This probably reflects the unique glaciological setting resulting from the narrow fringe of ice-free islands and peninsulas and offshore waters with deep areas that characterize this part of Greenland.

Romero and S. Kannada (2006. Can. J. Zool. 84: 1059-1065) provide a brief summary of North Atlantic whaling history as a critique of T. Rastogi et al. (2004. Can. J. Zool. 82: 1647-1654). However, they fall far short of providing an accurate review of whaling history in this region. The authors present a number of factual errors, misuse several key sources, and make significant omissions, ultimately defeating the purpose of providing information to biologists, managers, and historians. In this comment I highlight the mistakes in their representation of the history of North Atlantic whaling for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus L., 1758). There are unacceptable errors for most nations covered, and for American whaling in particular. The authors assert that over 30 000 bowhead whales were landed by Yankee whalers in the North Atlantic when the vast majority were in fact taken on the Pacific grounds. Although a summary of whaling history is an admirable goal and of potential value, it is unfortunate that the authors missed such an opportunity by failing to adequately research this topic, failing to include important citations, and by including sources that do not provide the information indicated. Providing a whaling summary with such errors and omissions only adds further confusion to an already confusing theme. © 2008 NRC.",,"Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A. 1986.

The hunting that occurred during this period is of primary significance for the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), because it has been interpreted as the largest human-induced reduction of the western North Atlantic population, with ∼12250-21000 whales killed. It has been frequently reported that the Basques targeted two species in this region: the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. To evaluate this hypothesis and the relative impact of this period of whaling on both species, we collected samples from 364 whale bones during a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Bones were found and sampled at 10 of the 20 sites investigated. DNA was extracted from a subset (n = 218) of these samples. Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b region identified five whale species. The identification of only a single right whale bone and 203 bowhead whale bones from at least 72 individuals indicates that the bowhead whale was likely the principal target of the hunt. These results imply that this whaling had a much greater impact (in terms of numbers of whales removed) on the bowhead whale population than on the western North Atlantic right whale population. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Balaena mysticetus; Basque; Bone; Cytochrome b; DNA; Eubalaena glacialis; Historical population size; Little ice age; Whaling","bone; cytochrome; DNA; ecological impact; human activity; Little Ice Age; mitochondrial DNA; population size; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Canada; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Strait of Belle Isle; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"McLeod, B.

The significance of killer whale Orcinus orca predation on baleen whales (Mysticeti) has been a topic of considerable discussion and debate in recent years. Discourse has been constrained by poor understanding of predator-prey dynamics, including the relative vulnerability of different mysticete species and age classes to killer whales and how these prey animals avoid predation. Here we provide an overview and analysis of predatory interactions between killer whales and mysticetes, with an emphasis on patterns of antipredator responses. 2. Responses of baleen whales to predatory advances and attacks by killer whales appear to fall into two distinct categories, which we term the fight and flight strategies. The fight strategy consists of active physical defence, including self-defence by single individuals, defence of calves by their mothers and coordinated defence by groups of whales. It is documented for five mysticetes: southern right whale Eubalaena australis, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. The flight strategy consists of rapid (20-40 km/ h) directional swimming away from killer whales and, if overtaken and attacked, individuals do little to defend themselves. This strategy is documented for six species in the genus Balaenoptera. 3. Many aspects of the life history, behaviour and morphology of mysticetes are consistent with their antipredator strategy, and we propose that evolution of these traits has been shaped by selection for reduced predation. Fight species tend to have robust body shapes and are slow but relatively manoeuvrable swimmers. They often calve or migrate in coastal areas where proximity to shallow water provides refuge and an advantage in defence. Most fight species have either callosities (rough and hardened patches of skin) or encrustations of barnacles on their bodies, which may serve (either primarily or secondarily) as weapons or armour for defence. Flight species have streamlined body shapes for high-speed swimming and they can sustain speeds necessary to outrun pursuing killer whales (>15-20 km/h). These species tend to favour pelagic habitats and calving grounds where prolonged escape sprints from killer whales are possible. 4. The rarity of observed successful attacks by killer whales on baleen whales, especially adults, may be an indication of the effectiveness of these antipredator strategies. Baleen whales likely offer low profitability to killer whales, relative to some other marine mammal prey. High-speed pursuit of flight species has a high energetic cost and a low probability of success while attacks on fight species can involve prolonged handling times and a risk of serious injury. © Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.","Cetacean; Defence; Killer whale; Orcinus orca; Predation; Predator avoidance","antipredator defense; marine mammal; morphology; pelagic environment; predation; predator-prey interaction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Orcinus orca; Thoracica",,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea I.

This effort included a double platform aerial survey design, satellite tracking of the movements of nine whales, and estimation of high-resolution surface time from 14 whales instrumented with time-depth recorders. Bowhead whales were estimated to spend an average of 24% (cv=0.03) of the time at or above 2 m depth, the maximum depth at which they can be seen on the trackline. This resulted in a fully corrected abundance estimate of 1229 (95% CI: 495-2939) bowhead whales when the availability factor was applied and sightings missed by observers were corrected. This surprisingly large population estimate is puzzling given that the change in abundance cannot be explained by a recent or rapid growth in population size. One possible explanation is that the population, which demonstrates high age and sex segregation, has recently attained a certain threshold size elsewhere, and a higher abundance of mature females appears on the winter and spring feeding ground in West Greenland. This in combination with the latest severe reduction in sea ice facilitating access to coastal areas might explain the surprising increase in bowhead whale abundance in West Greenland. © 2007 The Royal Society.",,"animal; article; bowhead whale; Greenland; population growth; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Greenland; Population Growth",,,,,,,"Borchers, D.L., Laake, J.L., Southwell, C., Paxton, C.G.M., Accommodating unmodelled heterogeneity in double-observer distance sampling surveys (2006) Biometrics, 62, pp. 372-378. , doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005. 00493.x; Born, E.W., Heide-Jørgensen, M.-P., Observations of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in central west Greenland in March-May 1982 (1983) Rep.

Estimates of bowhead whale abundance were used in a bioenergetic model to calculate the potential consumption of zooplankton during their 4 mo stay in Disko Bay. Between 2001 and 2006, 30 whales were fitted with satellite transmitters that provided information on daily movements, and 14 whales were tracked with archival time-depth or time-depth-fluorescence recorders that provided detailed dive data. Simultaneous data were collected on water column structure, phytoplankton and zooplankton density, taxa and biomass at 25 stations south of Disko Island in 2003, 2005 and 2006. After the retreat of annual winter sea ice, bowhead whales explored a limited area along the south coast of Disko Island and had high interannual site fidelity. Mean dive depths varied between 53 (SD = 35) and 109 (SD = 41) m but maximum dive depths were >400 m. Most dives targeted the bottom and dive durations >40 min were observed for several whales. Available prey for bowhead whales was dominated by calanoid copepods, with Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus occurring at 90 to 100 % of all stations between 0 and 50 m and contributing 78 ± 25% of the total biomass. Bottom sampling for epizooplankton in 2006 resulted in unprecedented densities of C. finmarchicus, several orders of magnitude higher than at any other depth. Bioenergetic modeling indicated the population consumes ∼220 US t of zooplankton per day or >21 000 t during the 4 mo stay in Disko Bay. Although the total biomass of zooplankton in the upper 50 m of the water column theoretically could support this predation level, benthic zooplankton densities and behavioral data suggest whales target preascension stage epibenthic copepods in high density patches. © Inter-Research 2007.","Bowhead whale; Calanus; Foraging; Greenland; Zooplankton","abundance; bioenergetics; crustacean; diving behavior; food consumption; foraging behavior; movement; predation; prey availability; primary production; radiotelemetry; satellite data; whale; zooplankton; Arctic; Disko Bay; Disko Island; Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Calanoida; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Calanus hyperboreus; Cetacea; Copepoda",,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Berggreen, U., Hansen, B., Kiørboe, T., Food size spectra, ingestion and growth of the copepod Acartia tonsa during development: Implications for determination of copepod production (1988) Mar Biol, 99, pp. 341-352; Brody, P.F., (1945) Bioenergetic growth, with special reference to the efficiency complex in domestic animals, , Hafner Publishing Company, New York; Costa, A.D., Durbin, E.G., Mayo, C.A., Variability in the nutritional value of the major copepods in Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts, USA) with implications for right whales (2006) PSZN I: Mar Ecol, 27, pp. 109-116; Croll, D.A., Acevedo-Gutiérrez, A., Tershy, B.R., Urbán-Ramirez, J., The diving behavior of blue and fin whales: Is dive duration shorter than expected based on oxygen stores?

An array of Directional Autonomous Seafloor Acoustic Recorders (DASARs) was deployed northeast of the Northstar oil production island near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Underwater sounds were recorded continuously for 24-35 days per year, mainly in September. More than 130000 bowhead calls were detected, and the directional capability of DASARs allowed triangulation of whale position for ∼93 500 calls. The migration pathway was closer to shore in 2003-04 than in 2001-02. Calls were clumped in space and time, and there was significantly more calling at night than by day. From 65% to 82% of calls were simple frequency-modulated calls, and the percentage of complex calls was positively related to the daily number of calls. No songs were detected, but in 2004 there were numerous call sequences consisting of repeated identical calls in series and generally lasting up to a few minutes. The DASAR methodology provides detailed information on the temporal and spatial distribution of calling whales and on their acoustic repertoire. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Autumn; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Calls; Diel pattern; Migration","acoustic method; autumn; calling behavior; environmental monitoring; island; migration; spatial distribution; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; North America; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"BLACKWELL, S.B., NORMAN, R.G., GREENE, C.R., Jr., McLENNAN, M.W., McDONALD, T.L., and RICHARDSON, W.J. 2004.

However, owing to the functional relationships among parameters in deterministic age-structured population dynamics models, placing explicit priors on each life history parameter in addition to the population growth rate parameter results in an incoherent joint prior distribution (i.e. two different priors on the estimated parameters). One solution to constructing a coherent joint prior is to solve for juvenile survival analytically, using values generated from the prior distributions for the remaining parameters. However, certain combinations of model parameter values result in values for juvenile survival that are larger than adult survival, which is biologically implausible. Therefore, to respect biological realism, certain parameter values must be rejected for some or all the remaining parameters. This study investigates several alternative resampling schemes for obtaining a realistic joint prior distribution, given the constraint on survival rates. The sensitivity of assessment results is investigated for data-rich (bowhead) and data-poor (walrus) scenarios. The results based on limited data are especially sensitive to the choice of alternative resampling scheme. © 2007 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","Age-structured population dynamics model; Bayesian statistics; Biological realism; Bowhead whale; Coherent joint prior; Marine mammal; Modelling; Sensitivity analyses; Stock assessment; Walrus","Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Mammalia; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus",,,,,,"Support for JRB was provided during the course of this research by MMS, NOAA/NMFS, and an NMFS–Sea Grant Fellowship in population dynamics.

The proposed methodology is based on Cormack-Jolly-Seber model [Cormack, R.M., 1964. Estimates of survival from the sighting of marked animals. Biometrika 51, 429-438; Jolly, G.M., 1965. Explicit estimates from capture-recapture data with both death and immigration-stochastic model. Biometrika 52, 225-247; Seber, G.A.F., 1965. A note on the multiple recapture census. Biometrika 52, 249-259]. Besides time effects in capture probabilities, the proposed models allow taking into account heterogeneity in capture probability caused by the existence of different groups of individuals in the population. For that purpose, the capture probabilities are fitted using a logistic model. Additionally, it is also possible to estimate group-specific survival rates. Goodness of fit is evaluated using Bayes factor methodology. The models are applied to an 11-year photoidentification capture-recapture experiment for bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus. The best model provides an estimate close to the one obtained by Zeh et al. [2002. Survival of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, estimated from 1981-1998 photoidentification data. Biometrics 58, 832-840] using the Jolly-Seber model, but accounting for heterogeneity in capture probabilities improves precision. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common bottle-nosed dolphin neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalu) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales.

However, the whale bone industry, and its relationship to Mackenzie Inuit economic and social systems, is poorly understood. A recently excavated archaeological assemblage from McKinley Bay, Northwest Territories, provides a record of intensive Nuvugarmiut whale bone tool manufacture, which can be used to reconstruct a reduction sequence. Bowhead bone reduction at McKinley Bay focused on ribs, which were transversely worked into large sections. Cortical blanks were isolated from central rib sections, but proximal and distal rib sections were treated directly as blanks and preforms for the production of large durable tools, such as harpoon heads, adze sockets, mattock blades, and picks. The intensive whale bone reduction at McKinley Bay was part of a broader gearing-up strategy focused on the manufacture and repair of sleds and harpoons needed for the late winter migration and spring seal hunt. More generally, because the whale bone industry was intimately related to the bowhead hunt and its proceeds, it may provide fundamental insights about key aspects of coastal whaling societies, such as social organization, redistribution, and inter-territorial trade. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Bone tools; Bowhead whale; Inuvialuit; Mackenzie delta region; Mackenzie Inuit; Reduction sequence; Scheduling; Tool production; Trade; Whaling","bone; manufacturing; whale; Canada; McKinley Bay; North America; Northwest Territories; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"ARNOLD, C., Archaeological investigations at Saunaktuk.

All stocks have been heavily depleted due to centuries of exploitation. In the present study, nucleotide sequence variation of the mitochondrial control region was determined from bone remains of 99 bowhead whales. The bones, 14C dated from recent to more than 50 000 bp, were collected on Svalbard (Spitsbergen) and are expected to relate to ancestors of the today nearly extinct Spitsbergen stock. Fifty-eight haplotypes were found, a few being frequent but many only found in one individual. The most abundant haplotypes of the Spitsbergen stock are the same as those most abundant in the extant Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) Seas stock of bowhead whales. Although FST indicates a slight but statistically significant genetic differentiation between the Spitsbergen and the BCB stocks this was not considered informative due to the very high levels of genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in both bowhead whale stocks. Other measures such as KST also indicated very low genetic differentiation between the two populations. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity showed only minor differences between the Spitsbergen and BCB stocks. The data suggest that the historic Spitsbergen stock - before the severe bottleneck caused by whaling - did not have substantially more genetic variation than the extant BCB stock. The similar haplotypes of the Holocene Svalbard samples and the current BCB stock indicate significant migration between these two stocks and question the current designation of five distinct stocks of bowhead whales in the Arctic. © 2007 The Authors.","Ancient DNA; Bottleneck; Conservation biology; Genetic diversity; Historical biogeography; Mitochondrial DNA","mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; bowhead whale; DNA sequence; genetic variability; genetics; haplotype; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Animals; Bowhead Whale; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Haplotypes; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Svalbard; Variation (Genetics); Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae","GENBANK: AJ554056, AP006472, DQ371698, DQ371699, DQ371700, DQ371701, DQ371702, DQ371703, DQ371704, DQ371705, DQ371706, DQ371707, DQ371708, DQ371709, DQ371710, DQ371711, DQ371712, DQ371713, DQ371714, DQ371715, DQ371716, DQ371717, DQ371718, DQ371719, DQ371720, DQ371721, DQ371722, DQ371723, DQ371725, DQ371726, DQ371727, DQ371728, DQ371729, DQ371730, DQ371731, DQ371732, DQ371733, DQ371734, DQ371735, DQ371736, DQ371737, DQ371739, DQ371740, DQ371741, DQ371742, DQ371743, DQ371744, DQ371745, DQ371746, DQ371747, DQ371748, DQ371749, DQ371750, DQ371751, DQ371752, DQ371753, DQ371754, DQ371755, DQ371756, DQ371757, DQ371758, DQ371759, DQ371760, DQ371761, DQ371762, DQ371763, DQ371764, DQ371765, DQ371766, DQ371767, DQ371768, DQ371769, DQ371770, DQ371771, DQ371772, DQ371773, DQ371774, DQ371775, DQ371776, DQ371777, DQ371778, DQ371779, DQ371780, DQ371781, DQ371782, DQ371783, DQ371784, DQ371785, DQ371786, DQ371787, DQ371788, DQ371789, DQ371790, DQ371791, DQ371792, DQ371793, DQ371794, DQ371795, DQ371796, DQ371797, DQ371798, NC_001321","DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,,"Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the Eastern Arctic, 1611-1911: Population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environment and History, 12, pp. 89-113; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology, 215, pp. 403-410; Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species (1993) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 10, pp. 960-970; Belikov, S.E., Boltunov, A.N., Distribution and migrations of cetaceans in the Russian Arctic according to observations from aerial ice reconnaissance (2002) Belugas in the North Atlantic and the Russian Arctic, pp. 69-86. , In: (eds.

It is hypothesized that cetacean (whale) integument will show unique anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment, particularly regarding differences in temperature, density, and pressure. In this study, the gross and histological structure of the southern right whale integument is described and compared with terrestrial mammals and previous descriptions of mysticete (baleen whale) and odontocete (toothed whale) species. Samples were taken of the integument of 98 free-swimming southern right whales, Eubalaena australis, and examined by both light and electron microscopy. Results show that three epidermal layers are present, with the stratum corneum being parakeratotic in nature. As in bowhead whales, southern right whales possess an acanthotic epidermis and a notably thick hypodermis, with epidermal rods and extensive papillomatosis. However, unlike bowhead whales, southern right whales possess an uninterrupted hypodermal layer. Surprisingly, the integument of balaenids (right and bowhead mysticetes) in general is more like that of odontocetes than that of the more closely related balaenopterids (rorqual mysticetes). Similarities to odontocetes were found specifically in the collagen fibers in a fat-free zone of the reticular dermal layer and the elastic fibers in the dermal and hypodermal layers. Callosities, a distinctive feature of this genus, have a slightly thicker stratum corneum and are usually associated with hairs that have innervated and vascularized follicles. These hairs may function as vibrissae, thus aiding in aquatic foraging by allowing rapid detection of changes in prey density. Although the thick insulatory integument makes right whales bulky and slow-moving, it is an adaptation for living in cold water. Epidermal thickness, presence of epidermal rods, and callosities may act as barriers against mechanical injury from bodily contact with conspecifics or hard surfaces in the environment (e.g., rocks, ice). © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Balaenid; Callosities; Epidermis; Integument; Moult; Papillomatosis; Southern right whales","collagen fiber; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquatic environment; article; dermis; elastic fiber; electron microscopy; epidermis; Eubalaena australis; female; foraging; hair; histology; integument; male; mammal; nonhuman; papillomatosis; priority journal; stratum corneum; subcutaneous tissue; swimming; vibrissa; whale; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Female; Integumentary System; Male; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Skin Physiology; Species Specificity; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Mammalia; Mysticeti; Odontoceti",,,,,,,"Ackman, R.G., Hingley, J.H., Eaton, C.A., Sipos, J.C., Mitchell, E.D., Blubber fat disposition in Mysticeti whales (1975) Can J Zool, 53, pp. 1322-1339; Albert, T.F., Migaki, G., Casey, H.W., Philo, L.M., Healed penetrating injury of a bowhead whale (1980) Mar Fish Rev, 42, pp. 92-96; Angell CM. 2005.

Histological sections from thyroid glands of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus L., 1758) were examined in conjunction with serological TH analyses. Serum was assayed for total and free triiodothyronine and total and free thyroxine via radioimmunoassay. Histomorphology of thyroid tissue was assessed by light microscopy and the utilization of an epithelial-follicular index (EFI). Age, sex, or season did not significantly affect serum TH levels. However, TH concentrations in pregnant or lactating females were found to be significantly lower than in the other sex and reproductive groups investigated. The EFI and epithelial height (EH) were greater in spring subadult and adult whales compared with those that were landed in the fall. No correlation was found between serum TH concentrations and serum, blubber, or liver levels of select polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites and organochlorine congeners examined. Low variability in concentrations of the serum THs across age, season, and sex and reproductive groups supports the existence of strong homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining TH concentrations in these presumably healthy animals. Departures from these ranges may indicate a disturbance in these regulatory mechanisms and may be a useful indication of toxicity or other health disorders. © 2007 NRC.",,"Bioassay; Biomarkers; Blood; Concentration (process); Health care; Immunology; Mammals; Optical microscopy; Epithelial follicular index (EFI); Radioimmunoassay; Serum; Thyroid histomorphology; Hormones; biomarker; disturbance; histology; hormone; immunoassay; metabolite; organochlorine; PCB; serum; toxicity; whale; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Ackman, R.G., Hingley, J.H., Eaton, C.A., Logan, V.H., Odense, P.H., Layering and tissue composition in the blubber of the northwest Atlantic sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) (1975) Can.

We demonstrate this method using microsatellite DNA data from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), sampled via Inuit hunting during the spring and autumn migration off Barrow, Alaska. This study includes a number of covariates such as whale ages and the time separation between captures. Applying the method to a sample of 117 bowhead whales, we use permutation methods to test for temporal trends in genetic differences that can be ascribed to age-related effects or to timing of catches during the seasons. The results reveal a pattern with elevated genetic differences among whales caught about a week apart, and are statistically significant for the autumn migration. In contrast, we find no effects of time of birth or age-difference on genetic differences. We discuss possible explanations for the results, including population substructuring, demographic consequences of historical overexploitation, and social structuring during migration. © 2007 The Authors.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Genetic structure; Microsatellites; Statistical modelling; Temporal pattern","microsatellite DNA; age; animal; article; biological model; bowhead whale; cluster analysis; comparative study; genetic variability; genetics; population genetics; population migration; sea; season; United States; Age Factors; Alaska; Animal Migration; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Cluster Analysis; Genetics, Population; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Variation (Genetics); Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Hobbs, R.C., Demaster, D.P., Determination of the sample size necessary to detect changes in length frequency distributions from a recovering population of bowhead whales (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 331-334; Avise, J.C., Helfman, G.S., Saunders, N.C., Hales, L.S., Mitochondrial-DNA differentiation in North Atlantic eels - Population genetic consequences of an unusual life-history pattern (1986) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 83, pp. 4350-4354; Beran, R., Balanced simultaneous confidence sets (1988) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 83, pp. 679-686; Bickham, J.W., Hunter, D.D., Matson, C.W., Huebinger, R.L., Patton, J.C., George, J.C., (2004) Genetic Variability of Nuclear Microsatellite Loci in Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas Bowhead Whales (Balaena Mysticetus): A Test of the Genetic Bottleneck Hypothesis, , Paper SC/56/BRG18 Presented to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission, June 2004; Bockstoce, J., (1986) Whales, Ice, and Men: The History of Whaling in the Western Arctic., , University of Washington Press, Seattle; Bockstoce, J.R., Burns, J.J., Commercial whaling in the North Pacific sector (1993) The Bowhead Whale, pp. 563-577. , In: (eds.

However, remains of lower trophic level bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus L., 1758) are available in the southern Beaufort Sea and their dietary contribution to polar bears has been unknown. We used stable isotope (13C/12C, δ13C, 15N/14N, and δ15N) analysis to determine the diet composition of polar bears sampled along Alaska's Beaufort Sea coast in March and April 2003 and 2004. The mean δ15N values of polar bear blood cells were 19.5%o (SD = 0.7%) in 2003 and 19.9% (SD = 0.7‰) in 2004. Mixing models indicated bowhead whales composed 11%-26% (95% CI) of the diets of sampled polar bears in 2003, and 0%-14% (95% CI) in 2004. This suggests significant variability in the proportion of lower trophic level prey in polar bear diets among individuals and between years. Polar bears depend on sea ice for hunting seals, and the temporal and spatial availabilities of sea ice are projected to decline. Consumption of low trophic level foods documented here suggests bears may increasingly scavenge such foods in the future. © 2007 NRC.",,"Biodiversity; Blood; Cells; Food products; Nutrition; Blood cells; Isotope analysis; Trophic levels; Mammals; bear; diet; isotopic analysis; pinniped; sea ice; stable isotope; trophic level; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; North America; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Abend, A.G., Smith, T.D., Differences in ratios of stable isotopes of nitrogen in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in the western and eastern North Atlantic (1995) ICES J.

This is the second bowhead found stranded dead in Newfoundland in seven years. The first, also an immature female, was discovered in a fjord in northeastern Newfoundland near Rattling Brook (49°40′ N, 56°10′ W) in October 1998. These animals represent the only bowhead whales known to have been sighted, alive or stranded dead, in waters around the island of Newfoundland. Some possible causes of the death of this most recent animal are discussed, including chronic inflammation of the vertebrae and the associated locomotive difficulties. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Bowhead whale; Labrador; Newfoundland; Spondylitis; Stranding; Vertebral injury","cause of death; historical record; injury; stranding; whale; Avalon Peninsula; Canada; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Rattling Brook; Witless Bay; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae",,,,,,,"AGUILAR, A. 1986.

Results include descriptions of the seasonal movements, distribution, and abundance of bowheads near St. Lawrence Island. The bowhead population appears to be increasing, as is the number of young whales seen. Changing environmental conditions are influencing distribution, leading to a somewhat earlier spring migration and a greater presence of whales near the island in winter. Hunters describe two bowhead migration paths near the island. It is unknown whether these two paths are used by two genetically different groups of whales, or whether the animals are simply responding differently to oceanographic conditions or geography. Our findings are consistent with studies of this bowhead population conducted elsewhere and suggest that additional research is needed to determine possible migratory (or genetic) differences between the two migrations of whales seen at St. Lawrence Island. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Balaena mysticetus; Bering Sea; Bowhead whale; St. Lawrence Island; Traditional knowledge; Yupik","abundance; documentary source; genetic variation; hunter-gatherer; migration route; migratory behavior; population distribution; population dynamics; seasonal variation; traditional knowledge; whale; Alaska; Bering Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; Saint Lawrence Island; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"ALBERT, T.F., The role of the North Slope Borough in Arctic environmental research (1988) Arctic Research of the United States, 2, pp. 17-23; BERKES, F., (1999) Sacred ecology: Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management, , Philadelphia: Taylor & Francis; BOCKSTOCE, J.R., (1986) Whales, ice, and men, , Seattle: University of Washington; BOCKSTOCE, J.R., and BOTKIN, D.B. 1983.

Retinol and alpha-tocopherol were the major forms of vitamins A and E detected, respectively. Liver contained the highest mean concentrations of vitamin A, followed by epidermis, blubber, and serum. Liver also contained the highest mean concentration of vitamin E, followed by serum, epidermis, and blubber. Stratification of retinol and tocopherol was examined throughout the blubber cores collected. Retinol concentrations were significantly higher in the epidermis than in the deeper blubber layers. Tocopherol concentrations were similar for epidermis and the intermediate layer of blubber. Both the epidermis and the intermediate layer of blubber had significantly higher tocopherol concentrations than the innermost and outermost blubber layers. Vitamin A and E concentrations were investigated with respect to gender and reproductive status of females (males, non-pregnant females, pregnant females), age groups and season of harvest. Certain persistent organic contaminants are known to have a negative effect on retinol concentration in serum of pinnipeds and cetaceans. Bowhead whales have relatively low concentrations of organochlorines (OCs) in comparison to other mysticete species. The relationships between serum, liver and blubber retinol and serum and blubber OC concentrations were examined with no significant correlations noted. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It is widely anticipated that impacts on marine mammals will be mediated primarily via changes in prey distribution and abundance and that the more mobile (or otherwise adaptable) species may be able to respond to this to some extent. However, the extent of this adaptability is largely unknown. Meanwhile, within the last few years direct observations have been made of several marine mammal populations that illustrate reactions to climate change. These observations indicate that certain species and populations may be especially vulnerable, including those with a limited habitat range, such as the vaquita Phocoena sinus, or those for which sea ice provides an important part of their habitat, such as narwhals Monodon monoceros, bowhead Balaena mysticetus and beluga Delphinapterus leucas whales and polar bears Ursus maritimus. Similarly, there are concerns about those species that migrate to feeding grounds in polar regions because of rapidly changing conditions there, and this includes many baleen whale populations. This review highlights the need to take projected impacts into account in future conservation and management plans, including species assessments. How this should be done in an adequately precautionary manner offers a significant challenge to those involved in such processes, although it is possible to identify at this time at least some species and populations that may be regarded as especially vulnerable. Marine ecosystems modellers and marine mammal experts will need to work together to make such assessments and conservation plans as robust as possible. © 2007 FFI.","Climate change; Conservation management; Dolphins; Marine mammals; Polar bears; Porpoises; Seals; Whales","climate change; climate effect; conservation management; ecosystem modeling; home range; marine mammal; prey availability; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Mysticeti; Phocoena sinus; Phocoenidae; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Atkinson, A., Siegel, V., Pakhomov, E., Rothery, P., Long-term decline in krill stock and increase in salps within the Southern Ocean (2004) Nature, 432, pp. 100-103; Brierly, A.S., Fernandez, P., Brandon, M., Armstrong, F., Millard, N., Antarctic krill under sea ice: Elevated abundance in a narrow band just south of Ice Edge (2002) Science, 295, pp. 1890-1892; Burns, W.C.G., Climate change and the International Whaling Commission in the 21st century (2002) The Future of Cetaceans in a Changing World, pp. 339-379. , eds W.G.C.

The model can be used for analysis of population substructure, and is particularly focused on relating genetic correlation to measurable covariates. The approach is intended for cases when the existence of subpopulations is uncertain and a priori assignment of samples to hypothesized subpopulations is difficult. Such a situation arises, for example, with western Arctic bowhead whales, where genetic samples are available only from a possibly mixed migratory assemblage. We estimate genetic structure associated with spatial, temporal, or other variables that may confound the detection of population structure. In the bowhead case, the model permits detection of genetic patterns associated with a temporally pulsed multi-population assemblage in the annual migration. Hypothesis tests for population substructure and for covariate effects can be carried out using permutation methods. Simulated and real examples illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the approach and enable comparisons with other familiar approaches. Analysis of the bowhead data finds no evidence for two temporally pulsed subpopulations using the best available data, although a significant pattern found by other researchers using preliminary data is also confirmed here.

Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), inhabitants of the Bering and Beaufort seas along Alaska's western and northern coasts, are 2 of the most important subsistence species, serving as major food sources to the native population. Objective: To describe an Inupiaq boy with symptoms consistent with an IgE-mediated food allergy after ingestion of bowhead whale and bearded seal meat. Methods: Extracts of cooked bowhead whale and bearded seal were prepared, lyophilized, and evaluated for protein content. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed for each extract, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and IgE immunoblots. Skin prick testing was conducted using reconstituted extracts of 1:10 wt/vol dilution. Results: Immunoblots revealed serum specific IgE binding with the extracts of bowhead whale and bearded seal meat. Protein bands of approximately 25, 40, 50, and 90 kDa were found in the seal meat. Protein bands of 55 and 90 kDa were found in the whale meat. Skin prick test results were positive to whale and seal extracts with appropriate positive and negative controls. Ten control subjects had negative reactions to both extracts.

Variation in open water with year was significant in all months except March, but interactions between region and year were not. Open water increased in both large and small regions, but trends were weak with least-squares regression accounting for ≤34% of the total variation. In large regions, positive trends in open water were strongest in September. Linear fits were poor, however, even in the East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, where basin-scale analyses have emphasized dramatic sea ice loss. Small regions also showed weak positive trends in open water and strong interannual variability. Open water increased consistently in five small regions where bowhead whales have been observed feeding or where oceanographic models predict prey entrainment, including: (1) June, along the northern Chukotka coast, near Wrangel Island, and along the Beaufort slope; (2) September, near Wrangel Island, the Barrow Arc, and the Chukchi Borderland; and (3) November, along the Barrow Arc. Conversely, there was very little consistent change in sea ice cover in four small regions considered winter refugia for bowhead whales in the northern Bering Sea, nor in two small regions that include the primary springtime migration corridor in the Chukchi Sea. The effects of sea ice cover on bowhead whale prey availability are unknown but can be modeled via production and advection pathways. Our conceptual model suggests that reductions in sea ice cover will increase prey availability along both pathways for this population. This analysis elucidates the variability inherent in the western Arctic marine ecosystem at scales relevant to bowhead whales and contrasts basin-scale depictions of extreme sea ice retreats, thinning, and wind-driven movements. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Climate change; Ecological scale; Sea ice","ice; sea water; ice cover; open water; prey availability; sea ice; whale; animal; Arctic; article; bowhead whale; environment; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bowhead Whale; Environment; Ice; Seawater; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Eurasia; Magadan [Russian Federation]; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Wrangel Island; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"(2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA [Arctic Climate Impact Assessment].

Based on the results from a very small sample, these authors concluded that whaling populations were already depleted before the onset of whaling. This is in direct contradiction to historical data. They also implied that the Basques were the only Europeans whaling in the North Atlantic before the onset of Yankee whaling and that there was a belief that Basque whalers historically killed equal numbers of right and bowhead whales. Here we present data based on historical and archaeological records generated by several authors using different methodologies, which clearly show that (i) Basques were not the only whalers that impacted cetacean populations in the North Atlantic; (ii) the number of whales killed by different peoples for approximately two centuries indicates that both right and bowhead whale population levels were much higher than typically assumed; and (iii) for many years there have been records published indicating that the Basques and others killed more bowhead whales than right whales, at least in the western North Atlantic. © 2006 NRC.",,"Whale; Whale bones; Whaling populations; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Genetic engineering; genetic analysis; skeletal remains; whale; whaling; Canada; Labrador; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Red Bay; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Persea borbonia",,,,,,,"De Acosta, J., (1590) Historia Natural Y Moral de Las Indias, , Fondo de Cultura Económica, México; Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

An apparent increase in diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other disease conditions among Alaska Natives has accompanied their change from a traditional diet to a more ""Western"" diet. In northern Alaska, the meat, maktak (epidermis and blubber), and other products of bowhead whales provide important components of Native diets. This study assessed the fatty acid constituents of bowhead whale blubber to evaluate their possible health benefits. Working with hunters in Barrow, Alaska, we acquired samples for chemical analysis from five blubber depths at each of six body locations. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of fatty-acid picolinyl esters to confirm the fatty-acid composition of samples. Analyses indicated that bowhead blubber contains relatively high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and that, on average, blubber samples from sites at the umbilical girth contain more omega-3 fatty acids than do samples from a girth 1 m caudal to the blowhole (roughly at the axillary girth). Omega-6 fatty acids were rare or undetectable in all samples. Omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested or shown to be important in the treatment or prevention of many diseases, including elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and some cancers. Beyond the cultural benefits associated with subsistence hunting of bowhead whales, consumption of bowhead whale blubber provides some important health and nutritional benefits. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Blubber; Bowhead whale; Diet; Fatty acids; Health; Omega-3; Omega-6","cardiovascular disease; chemical analysis; community response; diabetes; diet; fatty acid; gas chromatography; health impact; hunting; meat; nutritional status; obesity; whale; Alaska; North America; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Arnold, S.M., Middaugh, J.P., Use of traditional foods in a healthy diet in Alaska: Risks in perspective (2004) State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin, 8 (11), pp. 1-48. , 2nd ed.

Amplification of the DQB exon 2 provided sequences showing high within-species and between-species nucleotide diversity and uninterrupted reading frames consistent with functional class II loci found in related mammals (e.g., ruminants). Cloning of amplified products indicated gene duplication in the humpback whale and triplication in the southern right whale, with average nucleotide diversity of 5.9 and 6.3%, respectively, for alleles of each species. Significantly higher nonsynonymous divergence at sites coding for peptide binding (32% for humpback and 40% for southern right) suggested that these loci were subject to positive (overdominant) selection. A population survey of humpback whales detected 23 alleles, differing by up to 21% of their inferred amino acid sequences. Amplification of the DRB exon 2 resulted in two groups of sequences. One was most similar to the DRB3 of the cow and present in all whales screened to date, including toothed whales. The second was most similar to the DRB2 of the cow and was found only in the bowhead and right whales. Both loci showed low diversity among species and apparent loss of function or altered function including interruption of reading frames. Finally, comparison of inferred protein sequence of the DRB3-like locus suggested convergence with the DQB, perhaps resulting from intergenic conversion or recombination. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Cetaceans; Diversity; Dolphins; Overdominant selection","HLA antigen class 2; HLA DQ antigen; HLA DR antigen; allele; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; baleen whale; bowhead whale; cattle; convergent evolution; DQB like gene; DRB like gene; gene; gene amplification; gene conversion; gene disruption; gene duplication; gene function; gene loss; genetic recombination; genetic selection; genetic similarity; genetic variability; humpback whale; major histocompatibility complex; molecular cloning; Mysticeti; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; protein binding; southern right whale; species comparison; suborder; taxonomic rank; toothed whale; whale; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Evolution; Gene Duplication; Genes, MHC Class II; HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DR Antigens; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Variation (Genetics); Whales; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Bos taurus; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha","GENBANK: DQ354623, DQ354624, DQ354625, DQ354626, DQ354627, DQ354628, DQ354629, DQ354630, DQ354631, DQ354632, DQ354633, DQ354634, DQ354635, DQ354636, DQ354637, DQ354638, DQ354639, DQ354640, DQ354641, DQ354642, DQ354643, DQ354644, DQ354645, DQ354646, DQ354647, DQ354648, DQ354649, DQ354650, DQ354651, DQ354652, DQ354653, DQ354654, DQ354655, DQ354656, DQ354657, DQ354658, DQ354659, DQ354660, DQ354661, DQ354662, DQ354663, DQ354664, DQ354665, DQ354666, DQ354667, DQ354668, DQ354669, DQ354670, DQ354671, DQ354672, DQ354673, DQ354674, DQ354675, DQ354676, DQ354677, DQ354678, DQ354679, DQ354680, DQ354681, DQ354682, DQ354683, DQ354684, DQ354685, DQ354686, DQ354687, DQ354688, DQ354689","HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DR Antigens",,,,"Acknowledgements This study was supported by a grant to CSB, GML, and SJO from the Marsden Fund of New Zealand.

Transect sighting rate (transect sightings/km) indicated (ANOVA; F2, 980 = 143.84, p &lt; 0.0001) that bowhead whales occurred farther offshore in years of heavy ice conditions (73.4 km, 95% CL: 67.2-79.6 km) than in years of moderate (49.3 km, 95% CL: 44.8-53.84 km), or light (31.2 km, 95% CL: 30.0-32.4 km) ice conditions. The most plausible explanation for the observed pattern in bowhead whale distribution is that in years of heavy ice conditions (annual pack ice; 1983, 1988, 1991), the developing landfast ice limits availability of shallow nearshore habitat, thus necessitating use of leads and ice openings in deeper water. We acknowledge that factors such as bathymetry, ocean currents, transport, and food availability may also interact to influence autumn distribution of bowhead whales. In heavy ice years, however, these factors likely exert less influence on bowhead whale distribution than in years with light to moderate ice conditions. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whales; Distribution; Ice cover; Migration","aerial survey; bathymetry; migration; migratory behavior; migratory species; sea ice; whale; Alaska; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; North America; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Lodge, K.L., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus): Western Arctic stock (2002) NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-AFSC-133, pp. 171-176. , Angliss, R.P., and Lodge, K.L., eds.

With the exception of parapoxviruses, no molecular data of marine mammal poxviruses were available to infer genetic and evolutionary relatedness to terrestrial vertebrate poxviruses. Viruses were assigned to a cetacean poxvirus 1 (CPV-1) group based on nucleotide and amino acid identities of gene fragments amplified from skin lesions of Asian bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus), Atlantic bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus), rough-toothed (Steno bredanensis), and striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) dolphins. A different poxvirus was detected in skin lesions of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and provisionally assigned to a CPV-2 group. These viruses showed highest identity to terrestrial poxviruses of the genera Orthopoxvirus and Suipoxvirus. A novel species-specific poxvirus was also identified in skin lesions of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). None of these poxviruses were found to have amplifiable hemagglutinin gene sequences. Novel parapoxviruses were also identified in skin lesions of Steller sea lions and spotted seals (Phoca largha). A significant degree of divergence was observed in sequences of Steller sea lion parapoxviruses, while those of spotted seals and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) were highly conserved. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"DNA directed DNA polymerase; DNA topoisomerase; virus DNA; virus hemagglutinin; animal; article; biology; Cetacea; Chordopoxvirinae; classification; envelope gene; genetics; isolation and purification; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Poxvirus; seal; United States; virology; virus gene; Alaska; Animals; Base Sequence; Cetacea; Chordopoxvirinae; DNA Topoisomerases, Type I; DNA, Viral; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Genes, env; Genes, Viral; Hemagglutinins, Viral; Marine Biology; Phylogeny; Pinnipedia; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Poxviridae; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Chordopoxvirinae; dolphin (cetacean); Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Orthopoxvirus; Phoca; Phoca largha; Phoca vitulina; Pinnipedia; Poxviridae; Stenella coeruleoalba; Steno bredanensis; Suipoxvirus; Tursiops aduncus; Tursiops truncatus; Vertebrata",,"DNA directed DNA polymerase, 9012-90-2; DNA topoisomerase, 80449-01-0; DNA Topoisomerases, Type I, EC 5.99.1.2; DNA, Viral; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.7; Hemagglutinins, Viral",,,,,"Afonso, C.L., Tulman, E.R., Lu, Z., Zsak, L., Sandybaev, N.T., Kerembekova, U.Z., Zaitsev, V.L., Rock, D.L., The genome of camelpox virus.

Trace element concentrations in tissues were significantly different among whale species. Hepatic Ag was higher in belugas than bowheads and gray whales. Gray whales had lower Cd concentrations in liver and kidney than bowhead and belugas and a sigmoid correlation of Cd with length was noted for all whales. Renal and hepatic Se and THg were higher in belugas than in baleen whales. The hepatic molar ratio of Se:THg exceeded 1:1 in all species and was negatively correlated to body length. Hepatic and renal Zn in subsistence-harvested gray whales was lower than concentrations for stranded whales. Se:THg molar ratios and tissue concentrations of Zn may show promise as potential indicators of immune status and animal health. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

R3T 2N6, Canada","Nine bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) were instrumented with satellite transmitters in West Greenland in May 2002 and 2003. Transmitters were either encased in steel cans or imbedded in floats attached to wires. Transmitters mounted in steel cans had a high initial failure rate, yet those that were successful provided tracking durations up to seven months. Float tags had a low initial failure rate and initially provided large numbers of positions; however, they had deployment durations of only 2-33 d. All tracked whales departed from West Greenland and headed northwest towards Lancaster Sound in the end of May. Three tags with long tracking durations (197-217 d) recorded movements of whales (1♂, 2♀) into December in 2002 and 2003. All of these individuals remained within the Canadian High Arctic or along the east coast of Baffin Island in summer and early fall. By the end of October, all three whales moved rapidly south along the east coast of Baffin Island and entered Hudson Strait, an apparent wintering ground for the population. One of the whales did not visit Isabella Bay on east Baffin Island, the locality used for abundance estimation from photographic reidentification of individuals. The movements of whales tagged in this study raise critical questions about the assumed stock discreteness of bowhead whales in Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, and Davis Strait and indicate current estimates of abundance are negatively biased. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Canadian High Arctic; Satellite tracking; Stock identification; West Greenland","biotelemetry; movement; population estimation; stock identification; whale; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Bérubé, M., Palsbøll, P., Identification of sex in cetaceans by multiplexing with three ZFX and ZFY specific primers (1996) Molecular Ecology, 5, pp. 283-287; Brown, R., Notes on the history and geographical relations of the Cetacea frequenting Davis Strait and Baffin's Bay (1868) Proceedings Zoological Society of London, 1868, pp. 533-556; Clark, H., The whale fishery (1887) The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States.

To date, autonomous recorders have been successfully deployed in the Gulf of Alaska (1999-2001), the southeastern Bering Sea (2000-present), and the western Beaufort Sea (2003-2004). Seasonal occurrences of six endangered species (blue, fin, humpback, North Pacific right, bowhead, and sperm whales) have been documented on the basis of call receptions in these remote ocean regions. In addition, eastern North Pacific gray whale calls were detected in the western Beaufort Sea from October 2003 through May 2004. Here we provide an overview of this suite of research projects and suggest the next steps for applying acoustic data from long-term recorders to the assessment of large whale populations. © 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Acoustics; Alaska; Recorders; Remote sensing; Whales","Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeteridae",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

K7L 3N6, Canada","As early as 1611 Bowhead whales resident between the east coast of Greenland and the island of Spitzbergen were the subject of intensive commercial hunting effort by Dutch, German and British whalers. By 1911 there was no significant, permanent population of Bowhead whales living in these waters. To understand the relationship between the commercial exploitation of the Bowhead and their eventual extinction we must determine the chronology of their decline, starting with an estimate of the initial, pristine stock size. In this paper we compare and contrast four methodological approaches that can be used to estimate the Greenland-Spitzbergen Bowhead stock size prior to, and during, commercial exploitation. Using species-specific biological parameters, a delayed-difference recruitment model, and historical whaling records, we reconstruct the Greenland-Spitzbergen Bowhead population throughout the period of human predation. We estimate that there were approximately 52,500 adult Bowhead whales resident in the waters between the east coast of Greenland and the island of Spitzbergen in 1611. © 2006 The White Horse Press.","Bowhead whales; Historicalwhaling records; Marine mammal population estimation","catch statistics; historical ecology; population estimation; whaling; Arctic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Amundsen, E.S., Bjorndal, T., Conrad, J., 'Open Access Harvesting of the Northeast Atlantic Minke Whale' (1995) Environmental and Resource Economics, 6, pp. 167-185; Bockstoce, J., (1986) Whales, Ice and Men: The History of Whaling in the Western Arctic, , Seattle: University of Washington Press; Braham, H.W., 'The Bowhead Whale, Balaena Mysticetus' (1984) Marine Fisheries Review, 46, pp. 545-553; Carlos, A.M., Lewis, F.D., 'Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of the Hudson's Bay Company, 1700-1763' (1993) Journal of Economic History, 53, pp. 465-494; Chapman, D., 'Evaluation of Marine Mammal Population Models' (1981) Dynamics of Large Mammal Populations, , ed.

This paper presents observations of this species in Northeast Greenland and in the Greenland Sea between 1940 and 2004. The number of observations has increased in Northeast Greenland since the mid-1980s. Only three observations are known for the period 1940-1979 but during the 1980s, the 1990s and between 2000 and 2004, six, six and eight observations of bowhead whales were made, involving an absolute minimum of three, five and eight to ten different individuals, respectively. It remains uncertain whether this represents an increase in survey effort, an immigration from other areas, a recent recovery of an eastern Greenland relict ""tribe"" belonging to the Spitsbergen stock, or a combination of these factors. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"immigration; population growth; species occurrence; survey; whale; Arctic Ocean; Greenland Sea; Norwegian Sea; oceanic regions; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"Academy of Finland

Although these parasites have been extensively studied in terrestrial ecosystems, little is known about either parasite in the marine environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of both Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. in 5 marine mammal species. Fecal samples were collected from 39 bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), 49 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), 31 ringed seals (Phoca hispida), 22 bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), and 18 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) between 1998 and 2003. Using an immunofluorescent assay, parasites were detected in the feces of bowhead whales, right whales, and ringed seals, while neither parasite was detected in samples from bearded seals or beluga whales. Overall, prevalences were highest in ringed seals (Cryptosporidium spp., 22.6%; Giardia spp., 64.5%) and right whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 24.5%; Giardia spp., 71.4%) and lowest in bowhead whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 5.1%; Giardia spp., 33.3%).

L7R4A6, Canada","Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus; n=5) blubber, liver, muscle, kidney, heart, diaphragm, tongue, and uncooked maktak (bowhead whale epidermis and blubber) were collected during subsistence hunts at Barrow, AK, USA (1997-1999) to measure concentrations of persistent organochlorine contaminants (OCs). The exposure of humans to OCs via bowhead whales and other biota [fish, ringed (Phoca hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas)] as part of a subsistence diet was evaluated. Concentrations of OCs in bowhead whale tissues were correlated with lipid content (P<0.001) and were less than levels in other marine mammals reported herein, reflecting the lower trophic status of this cetacean. The relative proportions of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and sum (Σ) concentrations of chlordane components (ΣCHL), DDT-related compounds (ΣDDT), and polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCB) were not statistically different among the tissues analyzed (P<0.05). However, relatively higher proportions of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (ΣHCH), particularly β-HCH, were observed in bowhead whale heart and diaphragm (P<0.03). Based on Canadian and World Health Organization daily intake guidelines, ""safe"" human consumption rates of bowhead whale tissue and other marine biota were calculated. The most restrictive limits (mean value) for daily consumption for bowhead and beluga whale were 302 and 78 g for maktak and maktaaq (beluga whale epidermis and blubber), respectively. The tolerable daily intake limits of dioxin-like compounds from the consumption of bowhead whale blubber and liver were calculated to be 199 g (approximately 600 g for maktak) and 2222 g, respectively. A detailed profile of traditional/country foods consumed by subsistence communities of northern Alaska is required to address chronic exposure in more detail. Overall, bowhead whale tissues and other biota from northern Alaska are safe to consume at, or below, the levels calculated. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The specimen represents a new genus and species and is named Balaenella brachyrhynus. It was discovered in the Lower Pliocene of Kallo (northwest Antwerp, Belgium) and adds new information on the diversity and evolution of Balaenidae. Based on both comparative morphology and phylogenetic analysis, Balaenella brachyrhynus is morphologically closer to the genus Balaena, including the living Greenland Bowhead whale (B. mysticetus), and two Pliocene species (B. montalionis and B. ricei) from central Italy and the eastern USA. Balaenella brachyrhynus has very short nasals, a short rostrum relative to the total skull length and a horizontal supraoccipital. A cladistic treatment of 81 morphological character states scored for 10 balaenids and nine non-balaenid cetaceans revealed that the other small balaenids generally included in the genus Balaenula (including Balaenula astensis, B. balaenopsis and a Pliocene Balaenula sp. from Japan) are closer to the living genus Eubalaena (the Right whale). As the new skull is so different from the nominal Balaenula species, and as it is more closely related to Balaena than to Eubalaena, it is concluded that a small body size was a common condition in different Balaenidae clades. © The Palaeontological Association.","Balaenidae; Balaenula; Belgium; Cetacea; Mysticeti; Phylogeny; Pliocene","new species; phylogeny; Pliocene; whale; Belgium; Benelux; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe; World; Balaena; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenella brachyrhynus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Mysticeti; Zanclea",,,,,,,"Abel, O., Vorläufige mitteilungen uber die Revision der fossilen mystacoceten aus dem tertiär belgiens (1941) Bulletin Du Musée Royal D'Histoire Naturelle Belgique, 17, pp. 1-29; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationship of baleen whales established by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Árnason, U., Ledje, C., The use of highly repetitive DNA for resolving cetacean and pinniped phylogenies (1992) Mammal Phylogeny.

Anatomical observations confirmed the occurrence of a large, well-muscled tongue. Temporomandibular articulations were synovial. The mandibular symphysis was unfused. Standard measurement of baleen plates and close-range photogrammetry of a baleen rack confirmed that the anterior portion of the baleen rack is strongly convex, in contrast to its shape in balaenopterids. Moderate force applied to the lower lip in a lateral direction caused a pronounced abduction of the lower jaw. These observations support a conclusion that during feeding, the tongue may deflect the incoming flow of prey-laden water from side to side in the mouth, to convey prey slurries into the postlingual recess. Abduction of the lower lip likely would establish a channel for acceleration of flow around the outside of the baleen racks, reducing external pressures and drawing water out through the baleen. Thus, the shape of the baleen rack in the bowhead appears to be an adaptation to reduce the amplitude of the bow wave projected during feeding, the simultaneous advantage being concentration of prey slurries inside the mouth. It may also impart a configuration to the bow wave that stimulates countereffective evasive effort by actively mobile prey. Final compaction of a concentrated prey slurry in the postlingual recess probably involves retraction of the tongue against the oropharyngeal wall. These insights notably enable consideration of certain threats to bowheads and right whales (Balaenidae) associated with oil spills and oral entanglement. Previous research on the ""physiologic"" effects of fouling of baleen with oil is judged to be inadequate with respect to this taxonomic family. Oral entanglement with non biodegradable marine debris is predicted to be lethal because of interference with a critical hydrostatic oral seal. © 2005 American Society of Mammalogists.","Cetacea; Conservation biology; Entanglement; Feeding; Marine debris; Oil pollution","feeding; functional morphology; whale; Alaska; Barrow; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Phocidae",,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, 8, pp. 105-322; Andrews, R.C., Monograph of the Pacific Cetacea.

L7B 1A6, Canada","The feeding habitats of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus during summer and fall migration are generally known, but the relative amounts of food they consume in various parts of the seasonal range are poorly understood. We used natural geographic gradients in stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen within zooplankton (bowhead prey) to measure the relative importance of the eastern Beaufort Sea versus Bering and Chukchi Seas (combined) as feeding habitat for bowheads. The δ13C content of their prey differs by 3.9‰, on a weighted average basis, between the 2 regions. δ13C in bowhead muscle changed by only 0.5‰ while bowheads were in the Beaufort Sea, indicating that only ca. 10% of the muscle carbon in the average whale turns over during summer feeding, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 0 to 23%. Considering subadult whales only, estimated turnover averaged 14% with 95% CI of 4 to 23%. For adults, the estimated turnover was 5% (95% CI = 0 to 30%). Overall δ13C values in muscle are not significantly different in adult and subadult bowheads, suggesting no major age-related shift in the relative importance of different feeding habitats, and very closely matching Bering-Chukchi-derived food. δ15N values for muscles were near 1‰ higher in whales taken in the 1980s, consistent with the observed long-term declining trends in environmental δ15N values as indicated by chronological sampling of baleen plates. In contrast to muscle data, δ13C values in baleen, each representing feeding during a shorter time increment, do show seasonal and age-related differences. Subadult whales apparently feed more in the eastern Beaufort Sea than do adults, but nonetheless acquire insufficient food there to significantly alter their bulk carbon isotope ratios.","δ13C; δ15N; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bowhead whales; Chukchi Sea; Diet; Feeding habitats; Migration; Stable isotopes; Trophics; Zooplankton","carbon isotope; diet; feeding behavior; migration; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., The Beaufort undercurrent (1984) The Alaskan Beaufort Sea: Ecosystems and Environments, pp. 47-71. , Barnes PW, Schell DM, Reimnitz E (eds).

K9J 7B8, Canada","The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), is one of the world's most endangered large cetaceans. It is widely believed that Basque whalers caused the most dramatic decline of this species in the western North Atlantic during the early-16th and 17th centuries. Previous osteological analysis of 17 historic bones suggested that 50% of the Basque harvest consisted of right whales and 50% of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. This 50:50 ratio has been used to estimate pre-exploitation population size, which has subsequently formed the basis of recovery goals and plans for the North Atlantic right whale. Genetic analysis of 21 bones, 13 identified as right whales and 8 as bowhead whales through osteological examination, indicates that in fact only 1 bone was a right whale and 20 were bowhead whales. Additionally, preliminary microsatellite analyses of this specimen are not consistent with the hypothesis that whaling resulted in the low genetic variation found in this species today. These results differ from what would be expected based on any previous view of Basque whaling, and raise questions regarding the impact of Basque whaling on this species. © 2004 NRC Canada.",,"Bone; Fisheries; Genes; Genetic engineering; Population statistics; Satellite communication systems; Cetaceans; Population size; Whalers; Whaling; Marine biology; genetic analysis; genetic variation; historical ecology; identification method; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); oceanic regions; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

Complementary models were devised to investigate biomechanical aspects of water flow in the buccal cavity of the bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus during continuous filter feeding. A mathematical model was created to test and quantify water flow predictions with steady state hydromechanical equations; a physical model of the bowhead mouth (approximately 1/15 scale) was constructed to visualize flow processes. Both models rely on morphometric data obtained from whales harvested by Inupiat Eskimos for subsistence purposes along with information on foraging ecology (locomotor velocity, gape, etc.). Results indicate that unique features of balaenid oral construction and function (e.g. subrostral gap, orolabial sulcus, curvature of baleen, extensive mandibular rotation and lingual mobility) not only permit steady, unidirectional flow of water through the mouth, but also establish Bernoulli and Venturi effects during feeding. These hydrodynamic conditions allow balaenids to improve filtering efficiency and avoid creation of an anterior compressive wave (by increasing flow velocity and thereby reducing pressure) so that they may capture elusive prey even at slow swimming speeds.","Balaena mysticetus; Baleen; Bowhead whale; Buccal cavity; Feeding mechanism; Filtration; Flow; Hydrodynamics; Morphology; Tongue; Water flow","animal; article; audiovisual equipment; biological model; biomechanics; comparative study; feeding behavior; histology; morphometrics; mouth; physiology; pressure; water flow; whale; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Weights and Measures; Feeding Behavior; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Mouth; Pressure; Water Movements; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Albert, T.F., Project management, coordination of research efforts, and collection of tissue specimens from the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, and the gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus (1981) Tissue Structural Studies and Other Investigations on the Biology of Endangered Whales in the Beaufort Sea, pp. 19-42. , ed.

L7B 1A6, Canada","Bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, migrate west during fall ∼10-75 km off the north coast of Alaska, passing the petroleum developments around Prudhoe Bay. Oil production operations on an artificial island 5 km offshore create sounds heard by some whales. As part of an effort to assess whether migrating whales deflect farther offshore at times with high industrial noise, an acoustical approach was selected for localizing calling whales. The technique incorporated DIFAR (directional frequency and recording) sonobuoy techniques. An array of 11 DASARs (directional autonomous seafloor acoustic recorders) was built and installed with unit-to-unit separation of 5 km. When two or more DASARs detected the same call, the whale location was determined from the bearing intersections. This article describes the acoustic methods used to determine the locations of the calling bowhead whales and shows the types and precision of the data acquired. Calibration transmissions at GPS-measured times and locations provided measures of the individual DASAR clock drift and directional orientation. The standard error of the bearing measurements at distances of 3-4 km was ∼1.35° after corrections for gain imbalance in the two directional sensors. During 23 days in 2002, 10 587 bowhead calls were detected and 8383 were localized. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic devices; Biodiversity; Clocks; Coastal zones; Crude petroleum; Data acquisition; Global positioning system; Manganese nodules; Oil field development; Artificial islands; Bowhead whales; Directional frequency and recording (DIFAR) sensors; Seafloor recording; Sensors; accuracy; acoustics; analytical error; autumn; calibration; conference paper; directional autonomous seafloor acoustic recorder; directional frequency and recording sensor; directional hearing; global positioning system; hearing; industrial noise; measurement; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; recorder; sea; sensor; sound transmission; time; ultrasound; whale; Acoustics; Animal Migration; Animals; Calibration; Chemical Industry; Noise; Seasons; Sound Localization; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,"Bailey, T.C., Gatrell, A.C., (1995) Interactive Spatial Data Analysis, , Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex, UK; Blackwell, S.B., Greene Jr., C.R., Sounds from an oil production island in the Beaufort Sea in summer: Characteristics and contribution of vessels (2004) J.

It involves creation and analysis of nitrogen (picolinyl) ester derivatives of the fatty acids followed by combined gas chromatography - mass spectrometry for verification of structures. Use of this approach allowed the structural confirmation of 45 different fatty acids in the blubber sample. The traditional method of methyl ester derivatization of fatty acids followed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analyses provides more component characterization than analyses by gas chromatography - flame ionization detection, but not enough to effectively differentiate double bond isomers or branched compounds. Although the novel approach is time intensive, we recommend that it be employed for studies where the precise identification and confirmation of fatty acids is important.",,"fatty acid; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Ando, Y., Kawabata, Y., Narukawa, K., Ota, T., Desmospongic acids of the marine sponge Halichondria panacea from the coast of Hokkaido, Japan (1998) Fish.

Our archeological and paleolimnological data show that this was not always the case. Thule Inuit whalers, whose winter settlements consisted of houses constructed from the bones of bowhead whales on Somerset Island between about anno Domini 1200 and 1600, markedly changed pond water quality and ecology. The arrival of whalers 8 centuries ago caused marked changes in water chemistry and the expansion of moss substrates. Although whalers abandoned the area >4 centuries ago, the legacy of these human disturbances is still evident in the pond's present-day limnology and is characterized by elevated nutrient concentrations and atypical biota. This is the earliest reported paleolimnological record of changes in aquatic ecology associated with local human activities in Canada or the United States, or for any circumpolar ecosystem.",,"archeology; Arctic; article; bone; building material; freshwater environment; human; lake ecosystem; limnology; paleoanthropology; pond; population density; priority journal; whale; Animals; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Humans; Inuits; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Bryophyta; cellular organisms; Cetacea",,,,,,,"McCartney, A.P., (1979) Archaeological Whale Bone: A Northern Resource, , Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville; Derry, A.M., Kevan, P.G., Rowley, D.M., (1999) Arctic, 52, pp. 204-221; McGhee, R., (2000) Identities and Cultural Contacts in the Arctic, pp. 181-191. , eds.

Blood vessels serving this function consist of countercurrent heat exchangers (network of veins surrounding a central artery) favoring heat conservation and an alternate routing via arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) providing for heat dissipation. We tested the vasomotor responses of isolated segments of countercurrent arteries and AVAs from the bowhead tail flukes to norepinephrine (NOR), the sympathetic adrenergic neurotransmitter. Isometric tension developed during exposure to a micromolar concentration of NOR was consistently higher in AVAs than in arteries. Accordingly, the AVAs are subject to sympathetic vasoconstriction, and this activation directs blood flow to countercurrent heat exchangers and results in heat conservation.

Of these bears, 784 were observed offshore at 400 sightings. The surveys were conducted by the Naval Ocean Systems Center and Minerals Management Service; they were designed to monitor the fall Bowhead Whale (Balaena mysticetus) migration. Over the 20-year period, 1 096 620 kilometers of surveys were flown. The majority of the offshore Polar Bears, 595 bears at 290 sightings, and most of the kill sites and polar bear tracks were recorded in 80-100% ice cover. The number of bears per kilometer increased substantially in >24% ice cover, with the highest number observed in 80-100% ice cover. This habitat use probably is related to the availability of seals, their primary prey. There were 328 bears (83 sightings) recorded on land, and most of them were associated with whale carcasses and bowhead whale subsistence harvest sites along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast.","Alaska; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Habitat; Northern Bering Sea; Polar Bear; Ursus maritimus","aerial photograph; bear; habitat use; ice cover; prey availability; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; North America; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Amstrup, S.C., (1995) Movements, Distribution, and Population Dynamics of Polar Bears in the Beaufort Sea, 299p. , Ph.D. thesis.

These counts confirmed that at least a small proportion of the Bering-Chukchi- Beaufort Seas stock migrates along the western Bering Strait in late spring. The results of the counts in the Bering Strait were somewhat consistent between years. Taking into account that the whales passed by rapidly at great distances, we believe the number of whales seen during these counts is an underestimate of the actual number of whales migrating through the area. Our results indicate that the beginning of the spring migration of bowhead whales out of the Gulf of Anadyr varies by up to 30 days between cold and mild years, but in both cases, the area migration continues at least until 20 June. During the spring migration in the western Bering Strait, at the exit from the Gulf of Anadyr, whales moved over a broad front from near shore out to sea. When the directed migration began in May, the whales were not (or were seldom) observed to rest, feed, or engage in social behavior. Instead, we saw whales traversing long distances under water, swimming at speeds considerably faster than those of bowhead whales noted previously at Point Barrow.","Bering Strait; Bowhead whale; Gulf of Anadyr; Shore-based count","behavioral ecology; migration route; population estimation; swimming behavior; whale; Bering Sea; Chukchi; Chukchi Peninsula; Eurasia; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Bogoslovskaya, L.S., Votrogov, L.M., Semenova, T.N., Feeding habits of the gray whale off Chukotka (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 507-510; Braham, H.W., Krogman, B.D., Leatherwood, S., Marquette, W., Rugh, D., Tilman, M., Jonson, J., Carroll, G., Preliminary report of the 1978 spring bowhead whale research program results (1979) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 29, pp. 291-306; George, J.C., Carroll, G.M., Observation on spring migrating cow-calf pairs near Pt.

Zooplankton (n = 5) sampled near Kaktovik, Alaska, contained no measurable vitamin D2 or D 3, but did contain provitamin D (7-dehydrocholesterol), the cutaneous precursor for previtamin D3 in mammals. Fillets and livers from five fish species were sampled near Barrow, Alaska, and evaluated for vitamin D 3 content (no vitamin D2 was detected). Differences in vitamin D3 content appeared significant (P ≤ 0.10) among fish livers (Kruskal-Wallis [H test] = 8.25, df = 4, P = 0.08) and among fish fillets (H = 7.80, df = 4, P = 0.01). We also found significant differences in several pairwise comparisons (Mann-Whitney U-test) of vitamin D3 levels in fillets and livers. Blubber from six species of marine mammals had no detectable vitamin D2. The H test results for blubber vitamin D3 concentration were highly significant: 28.12, df = 5, P &lt; 0.001. There were also significant differences in vitamin D3 content from blubber in pairwise comparisons of primarily invertebrate feeders (bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) [mean = 4.20 SD ± 1.10 ng/g], and Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) [5.43 ± 2.82 ng/g]) vs. primarily piscivorous feeders (ringed seal (Phoca hispida) [746.57 ± 493.00 ng/g] and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) [426.00 ± 174.92 ng/g]) and a semiaquatic terrestrial carnivore (polar bear (Ursus maritimus) [406.17 ± 311.70 ng/g]). The bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) had intermediate blubber vitamin D3 concentration (156.83 ± 139.25 ng/g), which may reflect an intermediate-type feeding strategy or an artifact of the small sample size. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Arctic; Fishes; Marine mammals; Vitamin D; Zooplankton","Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus barbatus; Invertebrata; Leucas; Mammalia; Odobenus; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Phocidae; Pisces; Ursus; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Aurbach, G.D., Marx, S.J., Spiegel, A.M., (1992) Calciferols in Textbook of Endocrinology. 8th Ed., pp. 1420-1427. , Wilson JD, Foster DW, editors.

Classic Thule occupation of the Eastern Arctic (ca. AD 1000-1350) coincided with the Medieval Warm Period and was thought to have been facilitated by dog traction and open-sea hunting of bowhead whale. Despite the potential economic importance of whaling, dietary reconstructions for this period are based on the relative frequency of common prey types in midden faunal assemblages and rarely include bowhead whale skeletal elements, which often comprise the superstructure of Classic Thule residential dwellings. Although our findings are constrained by the paucity of Classic Thule burials at sites under study, they provide an empirically derived estimate of reliance on whaling for the Modified Thule, those who post-date AD 1350, indicating whaling accounted for approximately 12% of dietary intake. We also examine the relationship between Thule whaling and indicators of status and identify a Dorset-aged burial and three individuals with European diets among the proto-historic collection from Southampton Island. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 1483, Homer, AK 99603, United States","By March each year, coast-influenced sea ice in Alaska's northern Chukchi Sea consists of the shorefast ice itself plus ice floes moving in a zone that extends from immediately beyond the shorefast ice to coherent pack ice, some 100 km farther offshore. Because westward-drifting polar pack ice encounters fewer landmasses (and less resistance from them) once it passes Point Barrow, a semipermanent polynya or flaw zone dominates coastal ice in this region. Iñupiat residents use open water in flaw leads to hunt migrating bowhead whales from mid-April to early June. Although Iñupiat hunters grasp the nature and importance of ice in motion beyond their horizon, the flaw zone has received less scientific attention than either shorefast ice or polar pack ice farther offshore. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery is a form of remote sensing recently made available that allows us to address ice movement at a spatial scale familiar to traditional hunters. SAR-tracked ice movements differed between 2000 and 2001, illustrating contrasts between adverse and optimal conditions for spring whaling at Barrow. Case studies of ice-floe accelerations in the two contrasting seasons suggest that many variables influence ice motion. These include weather, seafloor topography, currents, sea-level changes, and events that occurred earlier during an annual accretion of ice. Adequate prediction of threats to ice integrity in the northern Chukchi Sea will require adjustments of our current concepts, including 1) recognizing the pervasive influence of the flaw zone; 2) replacing a focus on vessel safety in ice-dominated waters with an emphasis on ice integrity in high-energy environments; and 3) chronicling ice motions through coordinated ground observation and remote sensing of March-June events in future field studies.","Chukchi Sea; Flaw zone; Ice motion; Nearshore sea ice; Spring whaling","hazard management; ice movement; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; whaling; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; North America; oceanic regions; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Akasofu, S.-I., Aurora research during the early space age (2001) Fifty More Years below Zero: Tributes and Meditations for the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory's First Half Century at Barrow, Alaska, pp. 171-176. , Norton, D.W., ed.

Visual observers recorded a total of 3,295 ""new"" (not seen before) and 532 ""conditional"" (possibly seen before) whales in 1,130 h of watch effort, including 121 new calves (3.7% of the new whales). Concurrent with the visual survey, passive acoustic surveillance was conducted almost continuously from 16 April to 31 May, resulting in 27,023 locations of vocalizing bowhead whales. The estimated number of whales within 4 km of the perch (N4) was 9,025 (SE = 1,068). The estimated proportion of the whales within 4 km of the perch (P4) was 0.862 (SE = 0.044, computed by a moving blocks bootstrap). Combining these, the abundance estimate (N4/P 4) for 2001 is 10,470 (SE = 1,351) with a 95% confidence interval of 8,100-13,500. The estimated annual rate of increase (ROI) of the population from 1978 to 2001 is 3.4% (95% CI 1.7%-5%). Reports from hunters and results of an aerial survey in June 2001 indicate whales continued to pass Barrow after the survey had ended. In 2001 51% (572 h) of the watch was scored as occurring during ""fair-excellent"" visibility conditions, somewhat lower than the average for all surveys since 1978. Sea ice in the leads and fog were the principle environmental factors affecting visibility for all years. The estimated rate of increase and the fact that the number of calves counted in 2001 is the highest ever recorded suggest a steady recovery of this population. Other populations of large balaenids, notably the North Atlantic right whale, have failed to recover despite 70 yr of protection. The recovery of the bowhead whale is likely attributable to low anthropogenic mortality, a relatively pristine habitat, and a well-managed subsistence hunt. Nonetheless, offshore oil development, increasing shipping traffic, changes in the Bering Sea ecosystem, sea ice retreat, and possibly killer whale predation within its range could impact this bowhead population and should be carefully monitored.","Alaska; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Barrow; Bowhead whale; Migration; Passive acoustics; Population abundance; Sea ice; Trend","bioacoustics; population dynamics; population estimation; vocalization; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Hobbs, R.C., DeMaster, D.P., Determination of the sample size necessary to detect changes in length frequency distributions from a recovering population of bowhead whales (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 331-334; Best, P.B., Natural markings and their use in determining calving intervals in right whales off South Africa (1990) South African Journal of Zoology, 25, pp. 114-123; Best, P.B., Brandão, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, (2 SPEC.

The distribution of MeSO2-PCBs in blubber was dominated by 4-MeSO2-substituted congeners, the most abundant being 4-MeSO2-CB-70, 3′-MeSO2-CB-132, and 4-MeSO2-CB-64. Mean (± 1 standard error) sum (∑) MeSO 2-PCBs concentrations in blubber were low (6.23 ± 0.81 ng g-1 lipid normalized) compared to concentrations previously reported in other marine mammals. However, similar ratios of MeSO2-PCB metabolites to parent PCB congeners among marine mammals suggest that cytochrome P450 2B-like biotransformation and other necessary enzyme-mediated processes and mechanisms that influence the formation and clearance of MeSO 2-PCBs exist in the bowhead whale. Pentachlorophenol was the most abundant halogenated phenolic compound quantified in bowhead plasma (1.55 ± 0.19 ng g-1 wet wt). Despite indirect evidence for arene epoxidation of the biphenyl moiety inferred from MeSO2-PCB formation, ∑OH-PCB concentrations in bowhead plasma were low (1.52 ± 0.31 ng g-1 wet wt) compared to humans and marine mammals and were comprised of only two detectable OH-PCB congeners (4±-OH-CB-130 and 4-OH-CB-187). Further research is required to elucidate the toxicokinetics and distribution of OH-PCBs in this cetacean.","Arctic; Biotransformation; Cetacean; Pentachlorophenol; Polychlorinated biphenyl","Concentration (process); Enzymes; Hydroxylation; Metabolites; Oxidation; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Bowhead plasmas; Environmental engineering; biphenyl derivative; cytochrome P450 2B; dimethyl sulfone; halophenol; mesylic acid derivative; pentachlorophenol; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; biotransformation; metabolite; PCB; plasma; whale; article; Balaena mysticetus; biotransformation; blood sampling; epoxidation; female; human; hydroxylation; male; marine environment; metabolite; nonhuman; priority journal; whale; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biotransformation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Tissue Distribution; Whales; United States; Animalia; Arene; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Staphylococcus phage 187; Vertebrata",,"cytochrome P450 2B, 334677-51-9; dimethyl sulfone, 67-71-0; pentachlorophenol, 87-86-5; Environmental Pollutants; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,,,,"De Wit, C.A., Fisk, A.T., Hobbs, K.E., Muir, D.C.G., Kallenborn, R., Krahn, M.M., Norstrom, R.J., Skaare, J., Persistent organochlorine pollutants (2003) Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) II, , de Wit CA, Fisk AT, Hobbs KE, Muir DCG, eds.

The biota included zooplankton (Calanus spp.; n = 5), fish species such as arctic cod (Boreogadus saida; n = 10), arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus; n = 3), and marine mammals including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; liver: n = 23; blubber: n = 40), beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas; blubber: n = 20), ringed seals (Phoca hispida; blubber: n = 20), and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus; blubber: n = 7). The food web magnification factors (FWMFs) for HCHs and chlordane compounds ranged from 0.5 (γ-HCH) to 6.5 (HEPX) and were expected based on known recalcitrance and biotransformation of OCs. The enantiomer fractions (EFs) of all chiral OCs were near racemic (EF = 0.50) in seawater, zooplankton, and all fish analyzed. In contrast, the EFs for most OCs analyzed were nonracemic (EF ≠ 0.50) in the marine mammals blubber (range: 0.09-0.79) because of enantiomer-specific biotransformation and (or) accumulation. However, EF values were not significantly correlated with isotopically determined trophic level. The EFs for all chiral OCs (except α-HCH) in bowhead whale liver closely approximated the values in zooplankton, suggesting that the accumulation of chiral OCs from prey into this cetacean is not enantiomer specific. However, the modification of EFs from bowhead liver to blubber suggests that this species has the ability to enantioselectively biotransform and accumulate several chiral OC compounds.","Bioaccumulation; Cetaceans; Enantiomer fractions; Organochlorines; Pinnipeds","Impurities; Isomers; Metabolites; Seawater; Biomagnification; Toxicity; alpha hexachlorocyclohexane; chlordane; Arctic; article; Balaena mysticetus; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; Boreogadus saida; Calanus; Cetacea; chirality; Delphinapterus leucas; enantiomer; Erignathus barbatus; fish; food web; nonhuman; phoca hispida; priority journal; quantitative analysis; salvelinus alpinus; seal; United States; whale; zooplankton; Animals; Biological Availability; Biotransformation; Carcinogens; Chlordan; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Food Chain; Insecticides; Lindane; Liver; Molecular Conformation; Seals, Earless; Seawater; Tissue Distribution; Whales; Zooplankton; Animalia; Arctogadus glacialis; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Boreogadus saida; Calanus; cellular organisms; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus barbatus; Gadus morhua; Leucas; Mammalia; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Phocidae; Pinnipedia; Salvelinus; Salvelinus alpinus; Salvelinus alpinus salvelinus",,"alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, 319-84-6; chlordane, 12789-03-6, 57-74-9; alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, 319-84-6; Carcinogens; Chlordan, 12789-03-6; Insecticides; Lindane, 58-89-9",,,,,"De Wit, C.A., Fisk, A.T., Hobbs, K.E., Muir, D.C.G., Kallenborn, R., Krahn, M.M., Norstrom, R.J., Skaare, J., Persistent organochlorine pollutants (2003) Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) II, , de Wit CA, Fisk AT, Hobbs KE, Muir DCG, eds.

R3T 2N6, Canada","Historical records of commercial whalers operating in northwestern Hudson Bay during the 19th century were examined for information on size, age, sex, and location of bowhead whales that were either sighted or killed. Correlations between body size and either oil yield or baleen length were used to estimate the relative age classes (calf, subadult, adult) of whales for which no explicit age-class information was reported in the whaling logbooks. Cow-calf pairs and subadults, as well as adult whales, were sighted or killed throughout the whaling season in the area extending from Wager Bay south to Marble Island. This finding indicates that whales of many different age classes were present south of Wager Bay, even during the open-water period when whaling activity shifted northward to include Repulse Bay and Lyon Inlet. Recent observations suggest that few bowhead whales occur south of Wager Bay during the open-water season and that the population in this area has not recovered from the effects of commercial whaling. It is not clear whether this group of bowheads was a separate stock or, alternatively, waters south from Wager Bay constituted a second calf-rearing area for a single Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin stock.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Foxe basin; Hudson bay; Stock structure","historical record; population structure; stock assessment; whale; whaling; Canada; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"(1878) Logbook of the Schooner Abbie Bradford of New Bedford, , E.B.Fisher, Master. 8 May 1878-30 August 1879.

L7R 4A6, Canada","Stable isotope values (δ13C, δ15N) and concentrations of persistent organochlorine contaminants (OCs) were determined to evaluate the near-shore marine trophic status of biota and biomagnification of OCs from the southern Beaufort-Chukchi Seas (1999-2000) near Barrow, AK. The biota examined included zooplankton (Calanus spp.), fish species such as arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis), along with marine mammals, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus). The isotopically derived trophic position of biota from the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas marine food web, avian fauna excluded, is similar to other coastal food webs in the Arctic. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals were significantly greater than in fish and corresponded with determined trophic level. In general, OCs with the greatest food web magnification factors (FWMFs) were those either formed due to biotransformation (e.g. p,p′-DDE, oxychlordane) or considered recalcitrant (e.g. β-HCH, 2,4,5-Cl substituted PCBs) in most biota, whereas concentrations of OCs that are considered to be readily eliminated (e.g. γ-HCH) did not correlate with trophic level. Differences in physical-chemical properties of OCs, feeding strategy and possible biotransformation were reflected in the variable biomagnification between fish and marine mammals. The FWMFs in the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas region were consistent with reported values in the Canadian Arctic and temperate food webs, but were statistically different than FWMFs from the Barents and White Seas, indicating that the spatial variability of OC contamination in top-level marine Arctic predators is attributed to differences in regional sources of contamination rather than trophic position.

Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d","The Co-operative Institute for Arctic Research, located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF, Fairbanks, AK), provided financial support for this project. Data generation from the North Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, and White Sea was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Counsel, the Norwegian Research Council, and Pew Fellow Program in Marine Conservation, respectively. The analyses of OCs in biota from the Barents Seas were performed by the Environmental Toxicology Laboratory (Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, Oslo, Norway). The authors are very grateful for the provision of samples by the Inuit hunters at Barrow and Pt. Lay, AK. Benny Akootckok, C.D.N. Brower, H. Brower, Jr., L.A. Dehn, J.C. George, C. Rosa, R. Suydam, V. Woshner, G. Sheffield and many others provided additional samples. Beluga and seal age estimates were provided by R. Suydam (DWM) and L.A. Dehn (UAF). Age determination of arctic cod otoliths was performed by J. Casselman (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Picton, ON, Canada).

Best results were obtained when tags were deployed with a pole rather than a pneumatic gun. At least three of the tagged whales remained in the northwestern part of the bay for one to two weeks after tagging. A male and a female whale moved from Disko Bay to northern Canada. They left Disko Bay 11 days apart and took different routes across Baffin Bay to the southern part of the North Water polynya, just east of the entrance to Lancaster Sound. The whales crossed the central part of Baffin Bay relatively rapidly (travel time of 9-10 days, 3.1 and 4.5 km/h). Dive behaviour of one whale was monitored and showed changes in dive depths, dive rates, and surfacing times in different localities, indicating behavioural changes probably related to feeding. The whales were presumably feeding in both Disko Bay in May and in the southern part of the North Water (southeast of Bylot Island) in June. This study confirms whalers' observations that bowhead whales move between West Greenland and the east coast of Baffin Island.","Baffin Bay; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Canada; Dive behavior; Greenland; Satellite telemetry; Sea ice","diving behavior; feeding behavior; movement; tagging; telemetry; whale; Canada; Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Bérubé, M., Palsbøll, P., Identification of sex in cetaceans by multiplexing with three ZFX and ZFY specific primers (1996) Molecular Ecology, 5, pp. 283-287; Born, E.W., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Observations of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in central West Greenland in March-May 1982 (1983) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 33, pp. 545-547; Brown, R., Notes on the history and geographical relations of the Cetacea frequenting Davis Strait and Baffin's Bay (1868) Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1868, pp. 533-556; Buchanan, R.A., Sekerak, A.D., Vertical distribution of zooplankton in eastern Lancaster Sound and western Baffin Bay, July-October 1978 (1982) Arctic, 35, pp. 41-55; Croll, D.A., Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Tershy, B.R., Urban-Ramirez, J., The diving behavior of blue and fin whales: Is dive duration shorter than expected based on oxygen stores?

The region is beyond the bowhead's current range because of persistent summer sea ice. We argue that the region has been beyond the bowhead's range for most of postglacial time for the same reason. With one exception, the 16 known subfossil bowheads from the region date to the last 4000 14C years. Within the region, whale bones are most common adjacent to polynyas, which connect to more southerly channels extending from Baffin Bay. This distribution suggests that the polynyas, which here occupy areas of strong currents, developed as a result of shallowing of interisland channels due to postglacial uplift. The whale remains beyond the polynyas are seen as those of doomed strays that reached the polynyas from Baffin Bay and foraged farther along coastal leads before being trapped by freeze-up. This interpretation of Holocene sea-ice history agrees with the limited development of Holocene raised beaches in the region.

Ecol. and Fisheries Management, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, United States","Accurate age determination is fundamental to the study of population structure and individual growth rates of mysticete whales. Here the disequilibrium between 210Pb and 226Ra in the tympanic bullae of two mysticete whale species was investigated for use as a chronometer. Radiometric ageing depends upon accumulation of the naturally occurring radionuclide 226Ra (exclusive of other 238U decay-chain members) in the bullae and subsequent retention of its progeny 210Pb. Ages are determined from the 210Pb/226Ra activity ratio. Samples were obtained from five gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) with lengths of 4.5 (a neonate), 7.8, 8.7, 10, and 11.5 m, and two bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) with lengths of 12.9 and 17.4 m. In gray whales, radiometric ages were estimated in the three largest whales. In the neonate, the 210Pb/226Ra ratio was above one and was not usable. The 7.8-m gray whale was used to determine the initial 210Pb/226Ra ratio required for age determination. We propose a theory of gray whale bullae growth starting at the fetal stage with an open system (with a 210Pb/226Ra &gt; 1 and a fast growth rate), which transitions by 1 year old to a closed system (with a 210Pb/226Ra &lt;&lt; 1 and a slow growth rate). In both bowhead whales, radiometric age could not be estimated because the 210Pb/226Ra ratio was above one. The excess 210Pb in these bullae samples was likely accumulated from the whales' environment via prey, or in the case of the neonate gray whale, across the placental boundary. Our results indicate that the underlying assumptions of the 210Pb/226Ra radiometric ageing method may not hold true in bowhead whales. Successful application of this method to bowhead whales is therefore doubtful.",,"Growth kinetics; Population statistics; Radioisotopes; Radiometry; Age determination; Marine biology; age determination; lead isotope; radiometric method; radium isotope; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Pastor, T., Biological factors affecting variability of persistent pollutant levels in cetaceans (1999) J.

Calves and juveniles made up 89.3%, 96.6%, and 79.3% of the total number of measured whales in 1996 (n = 28), 1997 (n = 30) and 1998 (n = 29) respectively. The number of bowheads >13.5 m, the approximate size at which females reach sexual maturity, that were photographed was directly proportional to the number of calves photographed. Our results indicate that northern Foxe Basin bowheads are part of a more widely distributed stock. Adult males and resting adult females apparently summer in another part of the range, probably northwestern Hudson Bay. Northern Foxe Basin appears to be used as a summer feeding area by cows with young-of-the-year calves and by juveniles.","Age-class segregation; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Distribution; Northern Foxe Basin","age structure; photogrammetry; size structure; whale; Canada; Foxe Basin; Hudson Bay; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 313-324; Cosens, S.E., Innes, S., Distribution and numbers of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in northwestern Hudson Bay in August 1995 (2000) Arctic, 53, pp. 36-41; Cosens, S.E., Qamukaq, T., Parker, B., Anardjuak, B., The distribution and numbers of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, in northern Foxe Basin in 1994 (1997) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 111, pp. 381-388; Cubbage, J.C., Calambokidis, J., Size-class segregation of bowhead whales discerned through aerial stereophotogrammetry (1987) Marine Mammal Science, 3, pp. 179-185; Finley, K.J., Isabella Bay, Baffin Island: An important historical and present-day concentration area for the endangered bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) of the Eastern Canadian arctic (1990) Arctic, 43, pp. 137-152; Koski, W.R., Davis, R.A., Miller, G.W., Withrow, D.E., Reproduction (1993) The Bowhead Whale, pp. 239-274. , J.

Marine mammals have played a prominent part in our knowledge of the Quaternary vertebrates of Québec since Per Kalm was informed of a whale skeleton found inland from the St. Lawrence River about 1749. Five species of whales particularly adapted to inshore conditions have been reported from Late-glacial deposits of Champlain Sea age. The bones represent mainly white whales, but also narwhals, harbour porpoise, humpback, common finback and bowhead whales. Seals (ringed, harp, bearded and harbour) have also been discovered, and walrus remains are known from Sainte-Julienne-de-Montcalm and Saint-Nicolas. Sandpits at Saint-Nicolas (bottom-dwelling fishes, seabirds, ringed seal and white whale) and Saint-Césaire (fish, eider duck, ringed seal and white whale) have yielded important Champlain Sea vertebrate fossils, as well as paleoenvironmental information. Many well-preserved vertebrate remains have been found in calcareous nodules from Eardley and Breckenridge in the Gatineau area. Perhaps cave faunas will become increasingly important in sorting out the Quaternary vertebrate faunal sequence in Québec. The finds from caves near Saint-Elzéar and La Rédemption in Gaspésie, as well as Mine and Laflèche caves in the Gatineau region have already yielded fascinating insights.

HDBPs were found in samples from all locations studied. Concentrations of total HDBPs (ΣHDBPs) ranged from 0.4 ng/g lipid weight in ringed seals (Phoca hispida) from the White Sea to 2,540 ng/g lipid weight in Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) from the northwestern North Pacific Ocean. At their highest levels, ΣHDBPs made up 11% of the total quantitated organohalogen body burden of adult male Dall's porpoises. In two beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) data subsets, it was found that males contained significantly higher concentrations of ΣHDBPs than females. No significant effects of age or sex on ΣHDBPs were observed in harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) data subsets. The geographical distribution of concentrations did not resemble that of the ubiquitous anthropogenic organohalogen, polychlorinated biphenyl congener CB-153. Higher concentrations of HDBPs and different patterns of congeners were observed in samples from Pacific as opposed to non-Pacific Ocean influenced environments. Concentrations of HDBPs in beluga from the Arctic and St. Lawrence River were similar. Their high abundance in north Pacific Ocean biota and widespread occurrence suggest that HDBPs undergo extensive transport from a source located primarily in the Pacific Ocean.

Eleven such past bowhead assessments are compared. We note that the type of dynamics model used in all of these assessments has a strong influence on the features of the likelihood surface. We examine how the likelihood surface created by such models exhibits a narrow, cusp-shaped, flat-topped, steep-edged ridge of strong nonlinear dependency between key model parameters. We discuss how such features are generally troublesome for statistical inference and interpretation. Through examples we examine some of the implications for maximum likelihood estimation and the parametric bootstrap. Although such a dynamics model is very useful for producing realistic population trajectories, it is a poor model from which to generate likelihood functions in this case because it and the data together establish a nearly chaotic dynamical nonlinear system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The rank order of OC group concentrations (geometric mean, wet weight) in bowhead blubber samples were toxaphene (TOX; 455 ng/g) > polychlorinated biphenyls (∑PCBs; 410 ng/g) > dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane-related compounds (∑DDT; 331 ng/g) ≥ hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (∑HCHs; 203 ng/g) ≥ chlordanes and related isomers (∑CHLOR; 183 ng/g) > chlorobenzenes (∑CIBz; 106 ng/g). In liver, ∑HCH (9.5 ng/g; wet weight) was the most abundant ∑OC group, followed by ∑PCBs (9.1 ng/g) ≥ TOX (8.8 ng/g) > ∑CHLOR (5.5 ng/g) > ∑CIBz (4.2 ng/g) ≥ ∑DDT (3.7 ng/g). The dominant analyte in blubber and liver was p,p′-DDE and α-HCH, respectively. Total TOX, ∑PCBs, ∑DDT, and ∑CHLOR concentrations in blubber generally increased with age of male whales (as interpreted by body length), but this relationship was not significant for adult female whales. Biomagnification factor (BMF) values (0.1-45.5) for OCs from zooplankton (Calanus sp.) to bowhead whale were consistent with findings for other mysticetes. Tissue-specific differences in OC patterns in blubber and liver may be attributed to variation of tissue composition and the relatively low capacity of this species to biotransform various OCs.

In previous investigations, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in baleen from this population have been used to elucidate age, migratory behaviour, and feeding ecology. However, information on δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S isotope patterns in bowhead whale muscle tissue and variability within the Bering Sea population is limited. Stable sulfur isotope values did not vary with δ13C enrichment for three consecutive seasons (n = 53) and this suggests that habitat selection by bowhead whales was consistent over the sampling period. We found that in contrast to other studies, seasonal differences (spring versus fall) in δ13C values were not associated with seasonal changes in δ15N values, suggesting either that bowhead whales maintain a consistently lower trophic position relative to other marine mammals or that stable carbon and nitrogen isotope fractionation is tissue-dependent and (or) isotope-dependent within this species. Seasonal fluctuation in δ13C values was consistent for all age classes of bowhead whales and suggests that the Bering and Beaufort seas are both important regions for feeding.",,"Carbon; Ecology; Fractionation; Isotopes; Muscle; Sulfur; Seasonal fluctuations; Marine biology; feeding ecology; habitat selection; isotopic analysis; whale; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; cellular organisms; Cetacea; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Bradstreet, M.S.W., Cross, W.E., Trophic relationships at high Arctic ice edges (1982) Arctic, 35, pp. 1-12; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Finley, K.J., Sekerak, A.D., Griffith, W.B., Evans, C.R., Fabijan, M., Stallard, H.E., Aspects of the biology of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and its importance in Arctic marine food chains (1986) Can.

Bowhead tissues and zooplankton were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations and the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of eight chiral PCB congeners (PCB-91, 95, 135, 136, 149, 174, 176, and 183) to quantify the enantiomer-specific accumulation of PCBs in this cetacean. PCB concentrations in bowhead blubber were low (mean ± 1 SE: 610 ± 54 ng g-1 lipid) relative to other cetaceans. The accumulation of several chiral PCBs (PCB-91, 135, 149, 174, 176, and 183) in bowhead blubber was enantiomer-specific relative to bowhead liver and zooplankton, suggesting that biotransformation processes within the bowhead whale are enantioselective. The EFs for PCB-95 and 149 were significantly correlated with body length in male and female whales, while EFs for PCB-91 correlated with length in males only. Despite evidence for enantioselective biotransformation, all three congeners bioaccumulated in the bowhead relative to PCB-153. Results suggest that enantioselective accumulation of PCB-91, 95, and 149 is influenced by PCB concentrations, age, and/or the modification of an uncharacterized stereoselective process (or processes) during sexual maturity.",,"Biotransformation processes; Enantiomeric fractions (EFs); Harvesting; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Tissue; Bromine compounds; polychlorinated biphenyl; bioaccumulation; cetacean; PCB; animal tissue; article; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; body height; chirality; enantiomer; female; liver; male; nonhuman; sexual maturity; stereochemistry; whale; zooplankton; Adipose Tissue; Age Factors; Animals; Body Constitution; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Isomerism; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Sex Factors; Tissue Distribution; Whales; Zooplankton; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,"Environmental Pollutants; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,,,,"Hoekstra, P.F., Burnison, B.K., Neheli, T., Muir, D.C.G., (2001) Toxicol.

The samples were analyzed for a variety of persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordane and metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and DDTs and metabolites. The geometric mean, on a wet mass basis, of ΣPCBs (sum of 29 congeners and congener groups) were 732±282 ng/g (1 S.D.) in seals and 3395±1442 ng/g in polar bears. The geometric mean of ΣDDTs, ΣHCHs (α-, β- and γ- HCH) and HCB concentrations (wet mass basis) in seals and bears were 562±261 ng/g vs. 74.8±39 ng/g, 380±213 ng/g vs. 515 ng/g, and 17.4±10.1 ng/g vs. 183±153 ng/g, respectively. The geometric mean sum of chlordane (Σchlordane, sum of cis- and trans-chlordane, cis- and trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide) and dieldrin concentrations in ringed seals and polar bears were 753±617 ng/g vs. 720±315 ng/g and 38.6±22.8 ng/g vs. 130±65 ng/g, respectively. Apparent bioaccumulation factors (polar bear/ringed seal POP concentrations) were lower in the animals sampled near Barrow, Alaska than in those from locations in the Canadian Arctic. This suggests that polar bears are also preying on marine mammals from lower trophic levels than the ringed seals with correspondingly lower organochlorine levels, such as bowhead whale carcasses. PCB congener patterns in the samples demonstrated the metabolism of certain PCB congeners in the polar bear relative to the ringed seal in agreement with previous studies. Regional comparisons of animals collected in Alaska and Arctic Canada are presented.

Aerial photographs of naturally marked bowheads collected between 1981 and 1998 provided the data. The marked whales first photographed in a particular year provided the initial 'capture' and 'release' of those marked whales and photographs in subsequent years the 'recaptures'. The Cormack model, often called the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model, and the program MARK were used to identify the model with a single survival and time-varying capture probabilities as the most appropriate for these data. When survival was constrained to be one or less, the maximum likelihood estimate computed by MARK was one, invalidating confidence interval computations based on the asymptotic standard error or profile likelihood. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation of the model was used to produce a posterior distribution for annual survival. The corresponding reduced-parameter JS model was also fit via MCMC because it is the more appropriate of the two models for these photoidentification data. Because the CJS model ignores much of the information on capture probabilities provided by the data, its results are less precise and more sensitive to the prior distributions used than results from the JS model. With priors for annual survival and capture probabilities uniform from 0 to 1, the posterior mean for bowhead survival rate from the JS model is 0.984, and 95% of the posterior probability lies between 0.948 and 1. This high estimated survival rate is consistent with other bowhead life history data.","Bowhead whale; Capture-recapture estimation; Cormack-Jolly-Seber models; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Maximum likelihood; Open-population models; Photoidentification data; Survival rate","Bayesian analysis; mark-recapture method; maximum likelihood analysis; population modeling; survival; whale; article; assay; Bayes theorem; biometry; data analysis; maximum likelihood method; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; photography; probability; survival rate; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , B.

Since skeletal riders with minimal architectural or artifactual utility are associated with carcass portions that were socially and ritually prized ethnographically in North Alaska, this surface record may also preserve spatial structure relating to loci of high status settlement and/or ceremonial activity within sites. Close to 3400 bowhead bones were mapped at the major Thule winter village of Qariaraqyuk, southeast Somerset Island. The results of a principal components analysis of the element distributions are consistent with expectations for special treatment of bowhead flippers, tails, and tongues. These results are supported by excavation data which reveal that flipper and tongue bones were preferentially discarded in the vicinity of wealthy whaling households and a major ceremonial structure. Contrary to the longstanding belief that Thule whale bone assemblages are hopelessly compromised by prehistoric and historic bone transport, these assemblages hold great promise for investigating Thule social and ritual practices.

To ensure conservation of the whale populations, a forthright exposition of the origins, development and character of these hunts is needed in addition to stock assessment, a risk-averse catch limit algorithm and appropriate mechanisms within the whaling communities to ensure compliance. The hunts for Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) and Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Arctic and North Pacific, respectively, and Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Indonesia have long histories and local origins. Those for Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Lesser Antilles and at Tonga in the South Pacific were introduced by foreign commercial whalers. Whale hunting in the Philippines appears to have originated both locally and as a result of foreign influence. The relatively recent initiation of whaling for Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland required introduced technology but can be viewed as a modern adaptation of an ancient tradition. Consensus in deciding how to classify and manage non-industrial whaling has been, and will remain, elusive. Even with common definitions of key terms such as 'subsistence', 'commercial' and 'aboriginal', interpretations will depend on whether one's priorities are whale-centred or human-centred.","Bowhead Whale; Bryde's Whale; Conservation; Fin Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Minke Whale; Sperm Whale; Whales; Whaling","commercial activity; conservation management; subsistence; whale; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribbean Studies, 11, pp. 55-74; Adams, J.E., Shore whaling in St Vincent Island, West Indies (1973) Caribbean Quarterly, 19, pp. 42-50; Adams, J.E., Primitive whaling in the West Indies (1975) Sea Frontiers, 21, pp. 303-313; Adams, J.E., Last of the Caribbean whalemen (1994) Natural History, 103 (11), pp. 64-71; Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Akimichi, T., Asquith, P.J., Befu, H., Bestor, T.C., Braund, S.R., Freeman, M.M.R., Hardacre, H., Takahashi, J., (1988) Small-Type Coastal Whaling in Japan.

X0E 0T0, Canada","The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) and the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) are seasonal migrants to Canada's Western Arctic, occupying summer range in the southeastern Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR). These whales also travel through United States (Alaskan) and Russian offshore waters, which include migration routes and overwintering areas for both species. The beluga has for centuries been an important food resource of the aboriginal people of the Mackenzie Delta. From 1990 to 1999, the annual subsistence harvest of beluga in the ISR averaged 111, while only two bowheads were landed during this same period. The minimum size of the Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga stock has been estimated at 32 453 whales. The total annual removal of beluga by subsistence hunters from the ISR and Alaska is estimated at 189 whales, which is less than 0.6% of the minimum estimate of stock size. This level of harvest is sustainable. Between 1848 and 1921, commercial whalers decimated the Bering Sea population of bowhead whales. The size of the population, based on 1993 data, is estimated at 8200 (95% estimation interval of 7200-9400), constituting more than 90% of the world's remaining bowheads. This population increased at a rate of 3.2% from 1978 to 1993, while sustaining a harvest of about 0.6% per year. To ensure the continued well-being of these whales and their habitats, it is recommended that existing monitoring programs, commitments, and co-management partnerships be nurtured and maintained.","Beaufort Sea; Beluga; Bowhead; Migration; Stock status; Subsistence hunting","hunting; migration; monitoring; sustainability; whale; Amundsen Sea; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinapterus leucas; Leucas; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Adams, M., Frost, K.J., Harwood, L.A., Alaska and Inuvialuit Beluga Whale Committee (AIBWC) - An initiative in ""at home management"" (1993) Arctic, 46 (2), pp. 134-137; Andrews, R.D., Remotely releasable instruments for monitoring the foraging behaviour in pinnipeds (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 175, pp. 289-294; Belikov, S., (1999) The status of the white whale population (Delphinapterus leucas) inhabiting the Russian Arctic, , International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee Report SC/51/SM21; Bockstoce, J.R., (1986) Whales, ice and men: The history of whaling in the western Arctic, , Seattle: University of Washington Press; Born, E.W., Knutsen, L.O., Satellite-linked radio tracking of Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) in northeastern Greenland, 1989-1991 (1992) Saugetierkunde, 57, pp. 275-287; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Fissel, D.B., Zooplankton of a bowhead whale feeding area off the Yukon coast in August 1985.

AMG granules were not evident in bowhead tissues, confirming nominal mercury (Hg) concentrations (range = 0.011 to 0.038 ug/g ww for total Hg). In belugas, total Hg ranged from 0.30 to 17.11 and from 0.33 to 82.47 ug/g ww in liver and kidney, respectively. AMG granules were restricted to cortical tubular epithelial cytoplasm in belugas with lower tissue burdens; whales with higher tissue burdens had granules throughout the uriniferous tubular epithelium. In liver, AMG granular densities differed between lobular zones, concentrating in stellate macrophages and bile cannalicular domains of hepatocytes. AMG granules aggregated in periportal regions in belugas with lower hepatic Hg concentrations, yet among whales with higher Hg, AMG granule deposition extended to pericentral and midzonal regions of liver lobules. Mean areas occupied by AMG granules correlated well with hepatic Hg concentrations and age. In beluga livers, AMG staining density was not associated with lipofuscin quantity (an index of oxidative damage). Occasionally, AMG granules and lipofuscin were colocalized, but more often were not, implying that Hg was not a prominent factor in hepatic lipofuscin deposition in belugas. © 2002 by the Society of Toxicologic Pathology.","Autometallography;

Behaviors classified as reactions consisted of short surfacings, immediate dives or turns, changes in behavior state, vigorous swimming, and breaching. The helicopter elicited fewer detectable responses by bowheads (14% of 63 groups) than by belugas (38% of 40). Most observed reactions by bowheads (63%) and belugas (86%) occurred when the helicopter was at altitudes ≤150 m and lateral distances ≤250 m. Belugas reacted significantly more frequently during overflights at lateral distances ≤250 m than at longer lateral distances (P = 0.004). When the helicopter was on the ice with engines running, 7 of 14 groups of belugas reacted, up to 320 m away, sometimes with small-scale (≤100 m) diversion; only 1 of 8 groups of bowheads reacted. For the fixed-wing aircraft, few bowheads (2.2%) or belugas (3.2%) were observed to react to overflights at altitudes 60-460 m. Most observed reactions by bowheads (73%) and belugas (70%) occurred when the fixed-wing aircraft was at altitudes ≤182 m and lateral distances ≤250 m. However, the proportions reacting, especially to low-altitude flights (e.g., ≤182 m), were underestimated for both species because observation opportunities were brief. Even so, reactions were more common when the aircraft was low (≤182 m): P = 0.009 for belugas, P = 0.06 for bowheads. There was little if any reaction by bowheads when the aircraft circled at altitude 460 m and radius 1 km. Aircraft sounds measured underwater at depths 3 m and 18 m showed that a Bell 212 helicopter was 7-17.5 dB noisier than a Twin Otter (10-500 Hz band). Bell 212 sound consisted mainly of main rotor tones ahead of the helicopter and tail rotor tones behind it. Twin Otter sound contained fewer prominent tones. Peak sound level as received underwater was inversely related to aircraft altitude, and received levels at 3 m depth averaged 2.5 dB higher than at 18 m depth. The dominant low-frequency components of aircraft sound are presumed to be readily audible to bowheads. For belugas, these components may be inaudible, or at most only weakly audible. Mid-frequency sound components, visual cues, or both, are probably important in eliciting beluga reactions to aircraft.","Aircraft disturbance; Aircraft sound; Alaska; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Behavior; Beluga whale; Bowhead whale; Delphinapterus leucas; Helicopter; Underwater noise","aircraft; behavioral response; noise pollution; whale; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Delphinapterus leucas",,,,,,,"Awbrey, F.T., Thomas, J.A., Kastelein, R.A., Low-frequency underwater hearing sensitivity in belugas, Delphinapterus leucas (1988) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 84, pp. 2273-2275; Bel'kovich, V.M., Some biological observations on the white whale from the aircraft (1960) Zoologichesky Zhurnal, 39, pp. 1414-1422. , Translation NOO-T-403, U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, Washington, D.C. 17 pp. NTIS Ad-693583; Berzin, A.A., Doroshenko, N.V., Right whales of the Okhotsk Sea (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 451-455; Chapman, D.M.F., Ward, P.D., The normal-mode theory of air-to-water sound transmission in the ocean (1990) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 87, pp. 601-618; Dahlheim, M.E., Comments on bowhead acoustics (1981) San Diego workshop on the interaction between man-made noise and vibration and arctic marine wildlife, p. 64. , Feb. 1980.

A key criticism of the act is that it makes no reference to quantitative or even qualitative parameters of what constitutes ""danger of extinction."" Without objective standards to guide decisionmakers, classification decisions fall prey to political and social influences. We recommend the development of species-specific, status-determining criteria as a means to rationalize and expedite the listing process and reclassification decisions, independent of the requirement for delisting criteria in recovery plans. Such criteria should (1) clearly define levels of vulnerability, (2) identify gaps in information on life-history parameters, and (3) address uncertainty in existing data. As a case study, we developed preliminary criteria for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). Thresholds for endangered and threatened status were based on World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List criteria and population viability analyses. Our analysis indicates that particular attention must be focused on population structure within the species to appropriately classify the degree to which one or more components of a species are vulnerable to extinction. A similar approach could be used in the classification of other species. According to our application of the IUCN criteria and those developed for similar species by Gerber and DeMaster (1999), the Bering Sea population of bowhead whales should be delisted, whereas the other four populations of bowheads should continue to be considered endangered.",,"conservation status; Endangered Species Act; extinction risk; terminology; United States",,,,,,,"Akçakaya, H.R., Ferson, S., Burgman, M.A., Keith, D.A., Mace, G.M., Todd, C.R., Making consistent IUCN classifications under uncertainty (2000) Conservation Biology, 14, pp. 1001-1013; Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 313-324; Baillie, J., Callahan, D., Gärdenfors, U., A closer look at the IUCN Red List categories (1995) Species, 25, pp. 30-36; Brownell R.L., Jr., Burdin, A.M., Blokhin, S.A., Berzin, A.A., Observations on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Shantar Archipelago, western Okhotsk Sea (1997) International Marine Biological Research Institute Reports, 7, pp. 1-7; Burns, J.J., Montague, J.J., Cowles, C.J., (1993) The bowhead whale, , Special publication 2.

Data reported here include palpebral, eyeball, corneal, scleral, pupillary, and lens dimensions. These quantitative data have allowed us to compare structures relative to one another and sometimes to compare them with similar structures in other species. We found, for example, that the cornea is almost three times as thick at its periphery as at its center; that when the ratio of scleral thickness and eyeball size are compared, the ratio, in the bowhead whale, is twice that of any other cetacean for which data were available; and that the corneal and pupillary width to height ratios indicate a less elongated cornea and pupil than has been reported in other cetaceans. We also found a strong correlation between body length and eyeball size indicating that within the species, unlike what is seen between species, larger animals have larger eyes. Novel observations include the presence of three periorbital fatty layers, 112 ciliary processes, the presence of scleral canals, the absence of an obvious fovea or macular region in the retina, a holangiotic pattern of fundic vessels, the presence of zonular fibers and a lens sheath, and the absence of an obvious pupillary operculum. Anatomical features like the wide angle of divergence and the palpebral dimensions suggest the absence of binocular vision while features like the size of the palpebral sac, abundant conjuctival fat, and the prominence of the retractor bulbi muscle suggest mechanisms for the protrusion and retraction of the eyeball.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Cetacean; Cetacean eye; Eye anatomy; Eye morphology; Eyeball; Mysticete","eye; morphology; whale; Balaena mysticetus",,,,,,,"Burne, R.H., (1952) Handbook of R.

The elevations and radiocarbon ages of the remains demonstrate that the bowhead ranged commonly into the region following the submergence of Bering Strait at ca. 10, 000 14C yr B.P. until ca. 8500 14C yr B.P. During the same interval, bowheads ranged widely from the Beaufort Sea to Baffin Bay. Subsequently, no whales reached Wollaston Peninsula until ca. 1500 14C yr B.P. Late Holocene populations evidently were small, or occupations were brief, in comparison to those of the early Holocene. Although the late Holocene recurrence may relate to the expansion of pioneering Thule whalers eastward from Alaska, there are few Thule sites and limited evidence of Thule whaling in the area surveyed to support this suggestion. © 2001 University of Washington.","Artic sea-ice history; Beaufort sea; Bowhead whale fossils; Holocene climate change; Sea-level change; Thule culture","Holocene; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; radiocarbon dating; sea ice; sea level change; whale; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Northwest Territories; Nunavet; Victoria Island; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Victoria",,,,,"McGill University, McGill","Logistical support for field work in 1998 was provided equally by the Polar Continental Shelf Project, Natural Resources Canada, and the Hazards and Environmental Geology Subdivision, Geological Survey of Canada.

Brought to near extinction by commercial whaling, the North Atlantic 'meta-population' remains at less than 5% of its former abundance, and none of its three constituent stocks has shown demonstrable recovery during the last century. Two of these stocks, the Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay populations, occur in coastal waters of the Eastern Canadian Arctic during summer. Each of these two stocks numbers in the low hundreds and exists in isolated groups segregated by age and sex, showing strong fidelity to essential habitats. A skewed age distribution, predation by killer whales (Orcinus orca), hunting, net entanglement, tourism, climate change, habitat loss, and inbreeding suppression are some of the factors that may affect the bowhead's recovery. We need local and historical knowledge to understand the bowhead's natural history. Together with scientific data, such knowledge is also useful in evaluating the status of the species and prescribing a management plan. A recovery plan must employ the precautionary principle, both within the international 'meta-population' context and at the sub-population level; it must take a historical view and seek to protect abandoned habitats. Canada has conducted whaling activities that violate international agreements and diminish the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission.","Balaena mysticetus; Biology; Bowhead whale; Conservation; Greenland whale; Management; Traditional knowledge","historical ecology; species conservation; whale; whaling; (Northwest); Atlantic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Calanus; Calanus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Crustacea; Delphinidae; Mammalia; Orcinus orca; Orcinus orca; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Anders, G., Haller, A., Foote, D., Cove, P., The east coast of Baffin Island: An area economic survey (1967) Area Economic Survey Report, 66 (4). , Ottawa: Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 196 p; Anderson, R.M., Mammals of the eastern Arctic and Hudson Bay (1934) Canada's Eastern Arctic: Its History, Resources, Population and Administration, pp. 67-108. , Bethune, W.C., ed.

Tissue samples were collected between 1983 and 1997, mostly in 1995-97. The essential elements are reported to develop reference ranges for health status determination, and to help assess known or suspected interactions affecting toxicoses of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). In some tissues, Cd, Hg, and selenium (Se) were present at concentrations that have been associated with toxicoses in some domestic animals. Nevertheless, tissue levels of all elements were within ranges that have been reported previously in marine mammals. While mean Ag concentrations in beluga whale liver were relatively high (15.91 μg/g ww), Ag was not associated with hepatic Se levels or age, contrary to previous findings. Significant associations included: Cd with age, Zn, or Cu; Cu with age, Zn or Ag; and Hg with age, Se, Zn, or Cu. This study found hepatic Hg:Se molar ratios to be consistently lower than unity and different between species. Possible explanations for observed elemental correlations (i.e., interactions) and ancillary mechanisms of Cd and Hg detoxification are discussed.","Balaena mysticetus; Beluga whale; Bowhead whale; Cadmium; Cetaceans; Delphinapterus leucas; Elements; Marine mammals; Mercury; Molar ratio; Selenium; Silver","Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Leucas; Mammalia; metal; age; animal; Arctic; article; Canada; chemistry; female; kidney; liver; male; metabolism; muscle; reference value; species difference; tissue distribution; United States; whale; Age Factors; Alaska; Animal; Arctic Regions; Canada; Female; Kidney; Liver; Male; Metals; Muscles; Reference Values; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Tissue Distribution; Whales",,"Metals",,,,,"Aaseth, J., Olsen, A., Halse, J., Hovig, T., Argyria - Tissue deposition of silver as selenide (1981) Scandinavian Journal of Clinical Laboratory Investigation, 41, pp. 247-251; Arima, S., Gakura, N.A., Mercury and selenium content of Odondoceti (1979) Bulletin of the Japanese Society of Scientific Fisheries, 45, pp. 623-626; Becker, P.R., Mackey, E.A., Demiralp, R., Schantz, M.M., Koster, B.J., Wise, S.A., Concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons and trace elements in marine mammal tissues archived in the U.S. National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (1997) Chemosphere, 34, pp. 2067-2098; Suydam, R., Early, G., Koster, B., Wise, S.A., Relationship of silver with selenium and mercury in the liver of two species of toothed whales (Odonotocetes) (1995) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 30, pp. 262-271; Björkman, L., Mottet, K., Nylander, M., Vahter, M., Lind, B., Friberg, L., Selenium concentrations in brain after exposure to methylmercury: Relations between the inorganic mercury fraction and selenium (1995) Archives of Toxicology, 69, pp. 228-234; Bloom, N., Fitzgerald, W.F., Determination of volatile mercury species at the picogram level by low-temperature gas chromatography with cold-vapor atomic fluorescence detection (1988) Analytics Chemica Acta, 208, pp. 151-161; On the chemical form of mercury in edible fish and marine invertebrate tissue (1992) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 49, pp. 1010-1017; Crecelius, E.A., Determination of mercury in seawater at sub-nanogram per liter levels (1983) Marine Chemistry, 14, pp. 49-59; Bratton, G.R., Flory, W., Spainhour, C.B., Haubold, E.M., (1997) Assessment of Selected Heavy Metals in Liver, Kidney, Muscle, Blubber, and Visceral Fat of Eskimo Harvested Bowhead Whales Balacna Mysticetus from Alaska's North Coast, , Final report submitted to the North Slope Borough Dept. of Wildlife Management, Barrow, Alaska, 233 pp; Spainhour, C.B., Flory, W., Reed, M., Jayko, K., Presence and potential effects of contaminants (1993) The Bowhead Whale, pp. 701-704. , Special Publication Number 2 of The Society for Marine Mammalogy, J.

R0E 0K0, Canada","A serologic survey of influenza A antibodies was undertaken on 1,611 blood samples from five species of marine mammals collected from Arctic Canada from 1984-98. Sampling was done in 24 locations throughout the Canadian Arctic encompassing Sachs Harbor (72°N, 125°W). Northwest Territories in the west to Loks Land (63°N, 64°W), Nunavut in the east, to Eureka (80°N, 86°W), Nunavut in the north to Sanikiluaq (56°N, 79°W), Nunavut in the south. A competitive ELISA using a monoclonal antibody (Mab) against influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) was used. Five of 418 (1.2%) belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and 23 of 903 (2.5%) ringed seals (Phoca hispida) were serologically positive. None of the 210 walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus), 76 narwhals (Monodon monoceros) and four bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) had detectable antibodies to influenza A. Positive belugas were identified from communities on southeast Baffin Island while positive ringed seals came from communities in the eastern, western and high Arctic. Virus isolation attempts on lung tissue from a seropositive beluga were unsuccessful. We believe that influenza A infection in marine mammals is sporadic, the infection is probably self-limiting, and it may not be able to be maintained in these animals. Although the predominant hemagglutinin (H) type was not determined and therefore the pathogenicity of the strains to humans is unknown, the hunting and consumption of marine mammals by the Inuit may put them at risk for influenza A infection.","Competitive ELISA; Influenza A; Marine mammals; Serologic survey; Zoonotic infection","virus antibody; animal; animal disease; Arctic; article; blood; Canada; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemiology; immunology; influenza; Influenza virus A; seal; whale; Animal; Antibodies, Viral; Arctic Regions; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Influenza; Influenza A virus; Northwest Territories; Nunavut; Seals; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Walrus; Whales",,"Antibodies, Viral",,,,,"Callan, R.J., Early, G., Kida, H., Hinshaw, V.S., The appearance of h3 influenza viruses in seals (1995) Journal of General Virology, 76, pp. 199-203; Danner, G.R., McGregor, M., Serologic evidence of influenza virus infection in a ringed seal (Phoca hispida) from Alaska (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14, pp. 380-384; De Boer, G.F., Back, W., Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., An ELISA for the detection of antibodies against influenza A nucleoprotein in humans and various animal species (1990) Archives of Virology, 115, pp. 47-61; (1997) Annual Summary of Fish and Marine Mammal Harvest Data for the Northwest Territories, 1995-96, 8, pp. xii. , Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, 24 + 80 pp; Geraci, J.R., St. Aubin, D.J., Barker, I.K., Webster, R.G., Hinshaw, V.S., Bean, W.J., Ruhnke, H.L., Schooley, R.T., Mass mortality of harbor seals: Pneumonia associated with influenza A virus (1982) Science, 215, pp. 1129-1131; Hinshaw, V.S., Webster, R.G., Turner, B., The perpetuation of orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses in canadian waterfowl (1980) Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 26, pp. 622-629; Bean, W.J., Webster, R.G., Rehg, J.E., Fiorelli, P., Early, G., Geraci, J.R., St. Aubin, D.J., Are seals frequently infected with avian influenza viruses?

Specifically, on the basis of emergence curves determined for 10 localities surveyed in the CAA, stranded whale remains tend to be relatively common in beaches dating to approximately 2500-5500 B.P. and those older than 8000 B.P., but relatively rare in beaches dating to 0-2500 B.P. and 5500-8000 B.P. The former beaches apparently developed primarily during periods of relatively ice-free summer conditions, while the latter developed during periods of relatively pervasive summer sea ice that prevented bowheads from entering the region. Length-based mortality profiles of the stranded whale assemblages suggest that random processes, such as ice entrapment, were responsible for the death of most whales found on these beaches.","Bowhead whale; Climate change; Holocene; Mortality profiles; Sea ice","elevation; mortality; whale; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus",,,,,,,"Cosens, S.E., Blouw, A., (1999) Age classes of bowhead whales summering in northern Foxe Basin, , Canadian Stock Assessment Secretariat Research Document 99/135.

Our objective is to provide such a description for the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus. This study has examined the gross anatomy of the region in six specimens (five adults, one fetus) of the bowhead whale. Results show that the muscles associated with the eye are well developed and possess several distinctive features. For example, precise limits of each extraocular muscle are difficult to determine along their entire length because these muscles intermingle with one another near their insertion. Furthermore, some fibers from these muscles (except the retractor bulbi) also insert into the eyelids. Pulling on these muscles to simulate contraction results in movement of the eyelids and suggests a role for these muscles in palpebral retraction. Insertion of a large levator palpebrae superioris muscle into the upper eyelid further enhances opening of the palpebral fissure. Another unusual feature is the presence of tunnel-like structures that redirect the dorsal and ventral oblique muscles. The dorsal oblique muscle is redirected caudally about 90 degrees, then directed medially by another 90 degrees. These directional changes are accomplished via a connective tissue tunnel derived in part from the fibrous connective tissue of the dorsal rectus and the levator palpebrae superioris muscles. In most terrestrial mammals, a similar change in direction is accomplished by a cartilaginous trochlea. The ventral oblique muscle originates via a slender tendon from the frontal bone and undergoes a similar radical change in direction. Its tendon of insertion undergoes about a 90-degree change in direction that is accomplished through a tunnel-like structure derived from fibrous connective tissue of the ventral rectus muscle. Based on the morphology of the musculature presented, it is likely that the eyeballs and eyelids of the bowhead whale are quite mobile and appear capable of complex movement. The possibility of retraction and protrusion of the eyeball is discussed.

Passive acoustic location was based on arrival-time differences of transient bowhead sounds detected on sparse arrays of three to five hydrophones distributed over distances of 1.5-4.5 km along the ice edge. Arrival-time differences were calculated from either digital cross correlation of spectrograms (old method), or digital cross correlation of time waveforms (new method). Acoustic calibration was conducted in situ in 1985 at five sites with visual site position determined by triangulation using two theodolites. The discrepancy between visual and acoustic locations was <1%-5% of visual range and less than 0.7°of visual bearing for either method. Comparison of calibration results indicates that the new method yielded slightly more precise and accurate positions than the old method. Comparison of 217 bowhead whale call locations from both acoustic methods showed that the new method was more precise, with location errors 3-4 times smaller than the old method. Overall, low-frequency bowhead transients were reliably located out to ranges of 3-4 times array size. At these ranges in shallow water, signal propagation appears to be dominated by the fundamental mode and is not corrupted by multipath.

Automatic recognition can be used in wild animal research, including studies of behavior, population, and impact of anthropogenic noise. The method described here, spectrogram correlation, is well-suited to recognition of animal sounds consisting of tones and frequency sweeps. For a sound type of interest, a two-dimensional synthetic kernel is constructed and cross- correlated with a spectrogram of a recording, producing a recognition function - the likelihood at each point in time that the sound type was present. A threshold is applied to this function to obtain discrete detection events, instants at which the sound type of interest was likely to be present. An extension of this method handles the temporal variation commonly present in animal sounds. Spectrogram correlation was compared to three other methods that have been used for automatic call recognition: matched filters, neural networks, and hidden Markov models. The test data set consisted of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) end notes from songs recorded in Alaska in 1986 and 1988. The method had a success rate of about 97.5% on this problem, and the comparison indicated that it could be especially useful for detecting a call type when relatively few (5-200) instances of the call type are known.

Managing a limited harvest while allowing for stock recovery from commercial whaling requires some estimate of stock numbers. The large geographic range of bowhead whales in the eastern Canadian Arctic precludes cost-effective estimation of total stock size; however, estimates of summer aggregation sizes can be derived from sampling of summering areas. Although these numbers do not represent total stock size, they do provide indicators of the minimum number of bowheads known to be present and may be useful as indices for monitoring stock recovery. A visual aerial survey conducted in northwestern Hudson Bay resulted in an estimate of 75 ± 27.5 (95% Confidence Interval = 17-133) bowhead whales. This estimate is conservative because it was not corrected for submerged whales or for whales that were at the surface but not seen by observers.

While previous research into the effect of industrial noise on whale behavior and distribution has noted significant responses, this research has often proceeded from a parametric statistical framework. To account for the presence of spatially autocorrelated and intercorrelated data, we propose a suite of spatial analysis techniques to assess the distribution of bowhead whales relative to oil exploration activities. Using random resampling techniques and Mantel tests, we analyzed the distribution of bowhead whales around active drilling rigs in 1993. Results from the resampling tests indicated that whales were distributed farther from the drilling rig than they would be under a random scenario. Results from the Mantel tests indicated that in 1993, the spatial pattern of bowhead whale distribution was highly correlated with distance from the drilling rig, indicating that the presence of the drilling rig resulted in a significant temporary loss in available habitat. These techniques offer a new perspective on spatial analysis in the marine realm.",,"drilling rig; population distribution; spatial distribution; whale; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus",,,,,,,"Aagard, K., The Beaufort undercurrent (1984), The Alaskan Beaufort Sea.

Of 42 306 dives made by the eight whales during 1695 h, 9573 were sounding dives (>1 min duration). The mean duration of sounding dives for individuals varied from 6.9 to 14.1 min (mean = 10.4 ± 2.4 min, n = 8). Five whales made dives ≥61 min; the longest dives for the other three lasted 56, 45, and 32 min. Five tags measured maximum depths of 29 499 dives during 1220 h and time at depth during 1228 h. All five whales dived >100 m; the deepest dive was 352 m. Whales spent most of their time at depths ≤16 m, but three whales spent most of their time at depths >48 m during some sampling periods. Mean surfacing rates ranged from 18.2 to 47.0/h (mean = 26.2 ± 9.0/h, n = 8). Tags were exposed to air for 4.0-7.3% of the time (mean = 5.5 ± 0.95%, n = 8), and whales were potentially visible from aircraft for 8.5-16.4% of the time (mean = 11.1 ± 2.4%, n = 8). Three whales made longer sounding dives and had lower surfacing rates when in ≥90% ice cover.

Distinct habitats were described for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), white whales (Delphinapterus leucas), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) on the basis of habitat selection ratios calculated for bathymetric and ice cover regimes. In summer, bowheads selected continental slope waters and moderate ice conditions; white whales selected slope and basin waters and moderate to heavy ice conditions; and gray whales selected coastal/shoal waters and open water. In autumn, bowheads selected inner shelf waters and light ice conditions; white whales selected outer shelf and slope waters and moderate to heavy ice; and gray whales selected coastal and shoal/trough habitats in light ice and open water. Habitat differences among species were significant in both seasons (ANOVA F > 28, p < 0.00001). Interseasonal depth and ice cover habitats were significantly different for bowhead whales (p < 0.00002), but not for gray whales (p > 0.35).

These were the pelagic-feeding Greenland whale (Balaena mysticetus) and the benthic-feeding walrus (Odobaenus rosmarus rosmarus), the initial stocks of which prior to exploitation are estimated to have numbered approximately 46 000 and 25 000 animals respectively. Their annual food consumption at that time is estimated to have been some 4 million tons of plankton and 0.4 million tons of benthic organisms. Assuming that the primary and secondary production of the shelf/coastal ecosystem in the 16th century (before the peak of the Little Ice Age) was similar to that of the present day, the authors have concluded that a major shift in the food web must have occurred after the Greenland whales and walruses were eliminated. Planktonivorous seabirds and polar cod (Boreogadus saida) very probably took advantage of the extirpation of the Greenland whales, while eiders (Somateria mollissima) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) benefited from the walrus's extinction. In turn, the increased amount of pelagic fish provided food for piscivorous alcids and gulls, and may have given rise to the huge present-day seabird colonies on Svalbard.","Arctic; Food web; Human impact; Sea mammals","anthropogenic effect; exploitation; food web; historical ecology; marine ecosystem; marine mammal; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Odobenus rosmarus",,,,,,,"Banse, K., Antarctic marine top predators revisited (1995) Polar Biol., 15, pp. 93-104; Born, E.W., Gjertz, I., Reeves, R.R., Population assessment of the Atlantic walrus (1995) Meddelelser Norsk Polarinst., 138, pp. 1-100; Breiwick, J.M., Mitchell, E.D., Estimated initial population size of the Bering Sea stock of Greenland whales (Balaena mysticetus) from logbook and other catch data (1983) Report International Whaling Commission, 5 (SPEC.

Eight tags documented ≥9820 km of movements between 392 locations during 111 whale-tracking days. The whales did not move in unison. Individual movements and average speeds (1.1-5.8 km/h) varied widely. One whale stayed in Mackenzie Bay for 23.5 d, while the rest stayed an average of only 2.4 d. The majority of locations for all whales were in shallow water: 65% at <50 m depth and 87% at <100 m depth. Seven whales went into water >100 m deep and four were in water >500 m deep. The whale with the longest record traveled ≥3886 km to Siberia in 32.5 d, averaging 5.0 km/h. Its westerly route through the Beaufort and Chukchi seas was between 70° and 72°N and primarily in heavy ice (≥90% coverage), which was continuous west of 151°W. This whale's speed was faster, though not significantly, in heavy ice than in more open water. This is the first detailed documentation of the route and speed of a bowhead whale during its fall migration from Canadian to Russian waters.",,"feeding behavior; monitoring; movement; remote sensing; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Argos, (1990), User's manual.

Microgravity research, modulations in mechanical culture conditions (modeled microgravity), and shear stress have spawned innovative approaches to understanding the dynamics of cellular interactions, gene expression, and differentiation in several cellular systems. These investigations have led to the creation of ex vivo tissue models capable of serving as physiological research analogs for three-dimensional cellular interactions. These models are enabling studies in immune function, tissue modeling for basic research, and neoplasia. Three-dimensional cellular models emulate aspects of in vivo cellular architecture and physiology and may facilitate environmental toxicological studies aimed at elucidating biological functions and responses at the cellular level. Marine mammals occupy a significant ecological niche (72% of the Earth's surface is water) in terms of the potential for information on bioaccumulation and transport of terrestrial and marine environmental toxins in high-order vertebrates. Few ex vivo models of marine mammal physiology exist in vitro to accomplish the aforementioned studies. Techniques developed in this investigation, based on previous tissue modeling successes, may serve to facilitate similar research in other marine mammals.","Bowhead whale; Environmental toxicology; Modeled microgravity; Physiology; Rotating-wall vessel","metallothionein; animal cell; article; binding site; cell differentiation; cell interaction; controlled study; gene expression; kidney parenchyma; kidney proximal tubule; mechanical stress; microgravity; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding","GENBANK: AF022117",,,,,,"Anderson, A., Julshamn, K., Rindal, O., Morkore, J., Trace elements intake in the Faroe Islands.

R., University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775, United States","The Bering Sea is a rich marine ecosystem with 1995 U.S. landings of finfish and shellfish in excess of 2 x 106 tons. Recently, major declines of marine mammal and bird populations have occurred, with the question arising as to whether the causes were top down, i.e., from fishing pressure, or bottom-up, i.e., driven by climate-change effects. We assessed the latter scenario by using the inverse relationship between phytoplankton cell-growth rates and carbon isotope fractionation to compare seasonal rates of primary productivity. The isotope ratios in the long baleen plates from bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) laid down while the whales fed in the Bering and Chukchi seas were used as a proxy for the average annual isotope ratios in their zooplankton prey and, by extension, phytoplankton. Plates from 37 whales produced a continuous isotopic record from 1947-1997 and indicate that seasonal productivity was higher in 1947-1976, peaking in 1966. Since that time, average δ13C values have declined by over 2.7‰ until 1997, inferring a drop in seasonal carbon fixation of ~30-40%. Alternatively, lowered isotope ratios could arise if phytoplankton stocks significantly increased over time while cell-growth rates declined. However, long-term literature estimates for phytoplankton in the Western and Eastern Pacific Ocean and Eastern Bering Sea show either no trend or a decrease over time. Archaeological samples of baleen from ca. 100 and 2,200 yr. B.P. showed average δ13C values higher than any in the last five decades, implying still higher productivity in the past. The lowered carrying capacity is a likely contributor to the decline of top consumers in the region.",,"bottom-up control; carrying capacity; ecosystem; isotopic analysis; top-down control; trophic interaction; Bering Sea; Aves; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Is it food? addressing marine mammal and seabird declines workshop summary (1993) Alaska Sea Grant Report 93-01, , Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks; Anderson, P.J., Blackburn, J.E., Johnson, B.A., Declines of forage species in the Gulf of Alaska, 1992-1995, as an indicator of regime shift (1997) Forage Fishes in Marine Ecosystems.

Although still somewhat limited in scope, the largest amount of data exists for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT, mercury, and cadmium in walrus, beluga whale, bowhead whale, and ringed seal. Because of their relatively large contribution to the total chlorinated hydrocarbon levels in Arctic species, chlordane and toxaphene are two pesticides that are also gaining attention. Comparison of the Alaska database with the results of studies conducted in Canada and Greenland, indicates that patterns of many accumulative substances are quite similar in species that occur across the North American Arctic.

While several examples illustrate the utility of applying TEK in these contexts, wider application of TEK-derived information remains elusive. In part, this is due to continued inertia in favor of established scientific practices and the need to describe TEK in Western scientific terms. In part, it is also due to the difficulty of accessing TEK, which is rarely written down and must in most cases be documented as a project on its own prior to its incorporation into another scientific undertaking. This formidable practical obstacle is exacerbated by the need to use social science methods to gather biological data, so that TEK research and application becomes a multidisciplinary undertaking. By examining case studies involving bowhead whales, beluga whales, and herring, this paper describes some of the benefits of using TEK in scientific and management contexts. It also reviews some of the methods that are available to do so, including semi-directive interviews, questionnaires, facilitated workshops, and collaborative field projects.","Beluga whales; Bowhead whales; Collaborative field work; Herring; Impact assessment; Semi-directive interview; Social science; Traditional Ecological Knowledge","ecology; environmental management; traditional knowledge; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Delphinapterus leucas",,,,,,,"Adams, M., Frost, K., Harwood, L., Alaska and Inuvialuit Beluga Whale Committee - An initiative in at-home management (1993) Arctic, 46 (2), pp. 134-137; Agrawal, A., Dismantling the divide between indigenous and scientific knowledge (1995) Development and Change, 26 (3), pp. 413-439; Berkes, F., Traditional ecological knowledge in perspective (1993), pp. 1-9. , J.

Habitat selection indices were calculated for bowhead, white, and gray whales in heavy, moderate, and light ice conditions; and for high, moderate, and low transport (inflow) conditions at Bering Strait. Bowhead whales selected shallow inner-shelf waters during moderate and light ice, and deeper slope habitat in heavy ice conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.05-0.001). White whales selected slope habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.001), and gray whales selected coastal/shoal and shelf/trough habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.025-0.001), in all ice conditions. In the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, bowheads selected shelf waters and white whales chose slope waters, without regard to transport conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.01-0.001). In the northern Chukchi Sea, gray whales selected coastal/shoal habitat in high transport conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.005), and shelf/trough habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.001) during moderate and low transport conditions. Variability in distribution and habitat selection among these species is likely linked to prey availability at dissimilar trophic levels, although this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested.","Alaska; Arctic; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Gray whale; Habitat selection; White whale","aerial survey; arctic environment; cetacean; habitat selection; spatial distribution; (North); Alaska; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Monodontidae",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., The Beaufort undercurrent (1984), pp. 47-71. , Barnes, P.W., Schell, D.M., and Reimnitz, E., eds.
