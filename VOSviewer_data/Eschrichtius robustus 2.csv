Conservation management of the Eastern gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population through the regulation of whale watching in the lagoon Ojo de Liebre, Mexico, is a useful example of policy-making challenged by lack of scientific knowledge regarding the negative long-term effects of whale watching. We present a pragmatic approach to provide Mexican authorities the technical information they need to justify the establishment of a maximum number of boats under conditions of deep uncertainty. Operationally, our approach combines system dynamics modelling, to simulate the boats’ impact on the breeding habitat, with ecological risk assessment, to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold, which is associated to a risk of severely reducing the gray whale abundance in the lagoon. Thus, our approach addresses the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of boats to protect threatened species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation planning; Deep uncertainty; System dynamics modelling; Whale watching","Boats; Conservation; Decision making; Ecology; Environmental regulations; Laws and legislation; System theory; Uncertainty analysis; Conservation management; Conservation planning; Deep uncertainties; Ecological risk assessment; System dynamics modelling; Technical information; Uncertainty and ignorance; Whale watching; Risk assessment; abundance; conservation planning; ecological modeling; endangered species; policy making; species conservation; uncertainty analysis; whale; Baja California Sur; Laguna Ojo de Liebre; Mexico [North America]; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a, CONACYT: 294714

Here we characterized the acoustic environment of a summer foraging bay, also used for nursing and weaning, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. This area is also subject to whale watching. We examined changes in whale call number, rate, and structure received on a passive acoustic monitoring system deployed in an altered acoustic landscape. In particular, increased anthropogenic noise was examined, using representative 1/3 octave frequency bands generated by whale watching vessels and float planes. Whale watching traffic significantly shaped the acoustic landscape of the foraging locale, with distinct diurnal patterns in ambient noise. Calling rate (calls/hour/individual) was unchanged relative to the ambient condition, yet the number of core calls heard in the recordings increased, and the number of motherese-type calls decreased with elevated ambient noise. Calls were generally lower in frequency and shorter in length in increased ambient noise conditions. This may represent a calling response or a masking effect from the noise additions. It shows, however, that calling between conspecifics could be affected by human-derived noise additions. Similar changes in received calls were seen in periods of increased wind and wave noise, although less so for abiotic natural, than anthropogenic noise. Changes in calling, or accuracy in call reception and interpretation, may negatively influence prey acquisition, conspecific communication, and reunion of cow-calf pairs. © 2019, Centre for Applied Ocean Technology, Marine Institute.

These data are important for management because of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., indigenous harvesting, fishing gear entanglements, ship strikes, naval exercises, siting of marine renewable energy facilities). We applied satellite tags to 35 gray whales in the eastern north Pacific (ENP) off the coasts of Oregon and northern California from September to December 2009, 2012, and 2013. These whales are members of the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a subset of gray whales in the ENP that feed off the PNW, during summer and fall. Tracking periods for the satellite-tagged whales in this study ranged from 3 days to 383 days. We applied a Bayesian switching state-space model (SSSM) to locations for each whale track to provide a regularized track with 2 estimated locations per day and associated movement behavior (either transiting or area-restricted searching [ARS]). We isolated the portion of the SSSM track in the feeding area for each whale by removing all southward and northward migration locations. We calculated home ranges (90% isopleths) and core areas (50% isopleths) for these non-migrating, feeding-area tracks with &gt;50 SSSM locations using local convex hull utilization distributions. Feeding-area home ranges for the resulting 23 whales covered most of the near-shore waters from northern California to Icy Bay, Alaska, and ranged in size from 81 km2 to 13,634 km2. Core areas varied widely in size (11–3,976 km2) and location between individuals, with the highest-use areas off Point St. George in northern California, the central coast of Oregon, and the southern coast of Washington, USA. Nearshore waters off Point St. George were a hot spot for whales in the PCFG in late fall, close to where most of the whales were tagged; 19 whales had overlapping home ranges and 15 whales had overlapping core areas there. One whale, a male tracked for 383 days, did not migrate, spending the entire winter off Point St. George and the California-Oregon border. Residence times (portions of the track with a minimum of 3 successive locations in ARS behavioral mode) ranged from 1 day to 142.5 days; 19 whales had residencies &gt;30 days in some areas. Because most of the whales in this study were tagged in the fall in the southern portion of the feeding area, off northern California, results are weighted toward fall and winter movements. Although some whales were tracked into the spring and summer, additional tagging earlier in the year and in more northerly locations would provide an even clearer picture of gray whale use of feeding areas in the PNW. Nevertheless, these results constitute valuable information about high-use areas for gray whales in this region, providing baseline home range data for future comparisons with regard to year-to-year variability, potential responses to climate change, and exposure to anthropogenic activities in the marine environment. © 2019 The Authors.

Here we present the first study of baleen whales using the WorldView-3 satellite, which has a maximum spatial resolution of 31 cm in the panchromatic band, the highest currently available to nonmilitary professionals. We manually detected, described, and counted four different mysticete species: fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Ligurian Sea, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off Hawaii, southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) off Península Valdés, and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in Laguna San Ignacio. Visual and spectral analyses were conducted for each species, their surrounding waters, and nonwhale objects (e.g., boats). We found that behavioral and morphological differences made some species more distinguishable than others. Fin and gray whales were the easiest to discern due to their contrasting body coloration with surrounding water, and their prone body position, which is proximal to the sea surface (i.e., body parallel to the sea surface). These results demonstrate the feasibility of using VHR satellite technology for monitoring the great whales. © 2018 The Authors.

Macrobenthic species are essential prey for numerous marine mammals and seabirds but the influence of climatic drivers that control macrobenthic community population dynamics are poorly known in critical prey habitats. We investigated associations of environmental, temporal, and climatic covariates with the biomass concentrations of six prey groups (Actinopterygii, Amphipoda, Bivalvia, Cumacea, Isopoda, and Polychaeta) in essential habitats for Korean-Okhotsk (western) gray whales adjacent to northeastern Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk. Prey community biomass concentrations were correlated with water depth, year, and climate indices reflecting oceanographic and climatic patterns associated with macro-scale climatological effects. The correlation of prey biomass with water depth and year accounted for ∼90% of total variation in canonical correlation analyses (CCor). Climate indices accounted for ∼10% of total variation in CCor. Water circulation in winter may be particularly important for maintaining populations through the advection of particulate organic carbon entrained in winter currents. Overall, temporal trends in the biomass concentrations of gray whale prey resources appear to reflect climatic and oceanographic factors that are driving ecosystem changes across the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Arctic region. © 2019 The Authors","Ampelisca eschrichtii; Amphipoda; Climate change; Ecosystem variability; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrobenthos; Marine ecology; Monoporeia affinis; Temporal variability","Biomass; Ecosystems; Mammals; Organic carbon; Ampelisca eschrichtii; Amphipoda; Ecosystem variability; Eschrichtius robustus; Macro benthos; Marine ecology; Monoporeia affinis; Temporal variability; Climate change; organic carbon; amphipod; biomass; climate change; environmental impact; macrobenthos; marine ecosystem; prey location; temporal variation; whale; Actinopterygii; advection; Amphipoda; aquatic environment; biomass; biomass concentration; bivalve; Cetacea; climate change; controlled study; Crustacea; Cumacea; environmental change; environmental parameters; fish; gray whale; Isopoda; nonhuman; oceanography; Polychaeta; predation; predator prey interaction; prey biomass dynamics; Russian Federation; sea; trend study; water cycle; water depth; winter; animal; Arctic; ecosystem; food chain; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sea of Okhotsk; Actinopterygii; Ampelisca; Amphipoda; Bivalvia; Cumacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Isopoda; Mammalia; Monoporeia affinis; Polychaeta; Animals; Arctic Regions; Biomass; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Russia; Whales",,,,,,"We are grateful for the assistance of the captains and crews of the R/V Aademic Oparin R/V Okean, R/V Lavrentyev, R/V Igor Maksimov, and R/V Nevelskoye and scientists at the National Scientific Center of Marine Biology (NSCMB, previously the AV Zhirmunsky Institute of Marine Biology) of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

While (limited) fossil records confirm its presence in the Atlantic up until the 18th Century, its abundance and distribution within the Eastern and Western basins are still not well understood. The discovery of presumed gray whale fossil remains from the Georgia Bight and the Atlantic coast of Florida, from the mid-1980s to late-2000s, provides a new opportunity to recover additional data regarding their chronology within the Western basin. Here, we apply accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon techniques to six fossil whale finds, identifying dates within marine isotope stage 3 (59–24 ka) and the late Holocene, ∼2,000 yr BP. We additionally confirm the taxonomic identification of two fossil bone samples as E. robustus using collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS). The obtained dates, when combined with a larger corpus of previously published Atlantic gray whale fossil dates, support the hypothesis for the decline of the Atlantic gray whale in the late Pleistocene and the late Holocene. These new data augment the findings of the Eastern Atlantic Basin and better incorporate the Western Atlantic Basin into a pan-ocean understanding for the species. © 2019 Garrison et al.","Gray whale; Paleontology; Radiocarbon dating; Stable isotopes; Western atlantic basin; ZooMS","carbon isotope; isotope; unclassified drug; Article; chronology; collagen peptide mass fingerprinting; Eschrichtius robustus; Florida; fossil; Georgia (U.S.); mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; medical procedures; nonhuman; paleontology",,,,,,"Funding for molecular identification was provided through ORCA FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IOF 299075.

Holocene environmental changes and commercial whaling reduced their numbers, but gray whales in the Eastern Pacific now outnumber their Western counterparts by more than 100-fold. Herein, we investigate the genetic diversity and population structure within the species using a panel of genic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Results indicate the gray whale gene pool is differentiated into two substocks containing similar levels of genetic diversity, and that both our Eastern and Western geographical samples represent mixed-stock aggregations. Ongoing or future gene flow between the stocks may conserve genetic diversity overall, but admixture has implications for conservation of the critically endangered Western gray whale. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This study adds to the growing body of passive acoustic research outside of the calving/breeding lagoons, and moves toward a description of calling behaviors throughout the whales' range. Data are presented here from acoustic surveys for two northward and one southward migration, with recordings taken off the west coast of Vancouver Island. We found gray whales to be highly sonorous, with extensive calling during the study periods of February to May for northward migrations and September to the end of January for southward travel. Low frequency moans were the most prevalent call type, with others, including knocks, up- and down sweeps, and rumbles, recorded in varying numbers. We hypothesize that calling is an aid for navigation and orientation of the herd along the migration route, in addition to holding more social functions usually assigned to baleen whale calling. © 2018 Burnham, Duffus and Mouy.","Acoustics; Gray whales; Migration; Passive acoustic monitoring; Vocalizations",,,,,,,,,"Asa-Dorian, P.V., Perkins, P.J., The controversial production of sound by the california gray whale Eschrichtius Gibbosus (1967) Norw.

Commercial boat-based whale-watching operations along the west coast of North America were observed for sustainable practices. Data recorded aboard whale-watching vessels and collected via an online survey were integrated into the Lean Six Sigma quality-improvement tool, in order to review business processes and identify where inefficiency or ineffectiveness exists in specific phases within a process. Whale-watching practices were analyzed using this method for 24 whale-watching companies operating in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The results show a high level of variation in management regimes, and operator non-compliance with guidelines, and highlight avenues to eliminate, revise or reduce inefficiency, and improve practices in the interests of high-quality and sustainable operations. We recommend more specific and operational guidelines that allow operators to focus on high compliance with the most critical aspects of their business operation in order to build the sustainability of commercial tourist interactions with gray whales in their migratory range. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cetacean conservation; Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus); Lean Six Sigma (LSS); migratory range; pelagic; whale watching","conservation management; ecotourism; guideline; migratory behavior; migratory species; sustainability; tourist attraction; whale; Canada; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Coast [North America]; United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysticeti",,,,,"Whaleman Foundation","I am grateful to my advisors and research colleagues, whose excitement, insight and support for this project were necessary in order to collect data along the entire gray whale migration route.

The Whaleman Foundation’s financial support and vision for research in Mexico was provided by founder Jeff Pantukhoff. Dr Fredrik Christiansen made time from across many time zones for detailed discussions on baleen whale body condition, migration strategy and responses to whale watching; and became a friend which I am grateful. Dr Lars Bejder, a leader in sustainable whale watching research, helped fill the gaps for studying an entire migratory route, Thank you Lars. This research effort would not have launched without the assistance of Ryan Wulff, the IWC Whale-Watching Group Chairman; it was his initial idea to survey operators and include their voice in this study. It was an honor to work with Dr John Hildebrand, who initially thought to explore the gray whale migration as a focal point for this research project.

For bottom-feeding marine birds and mammals, repeated benthic sampling over large areas to document changes and to develop predictive models of prey dispersion is quite costly. More easily monitored variables that relate strongly to the biomass and structure of benthic assemblages, and are more readily predicted from physical models of climate change, would facilitate planning efforts. The organic carbon (OC) content of sediments integrates diverse physical and biotic processes, and can be less variable over time than primary production, salinity, temperature, or position of water masses. Sediment OC further subsumes inputs at the base of food webs that can limit carbon flows to higher taxa. For the northern Bering Sea, this study explored the utility of sediment OC as a predictor of benthic assemblage types. Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling distinguished three main types along a gradient of sediment OC. The assemblage for highest sediment OC had a much greater biomass of brittlestars, diverse marine worms, and two mid-sized, thinner-shelled bivalves selected as prey by diving sea ducks. The assemblage for lowest sediment OC lacked brittlestars, had a much greater biomass of amphipods sought by gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), and had a much higher biomass of two often larger or thicker-shelled bivalves commonly targeted by walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). Areas of exceptionally low sediment OC tended towards dominance by sand dollars with low foraging value. Our study shows that sediment OC has promise as a proxy for monitoring and predicting changes in important prey assemblages in a given region. Models that link predicted hydrographic patterns to lateral advection of phytodetritus, and the resulting sediment OC, may further allow the use of physical climate models to project the future dispersion of benthic habitats for endothermic predators.

Besides previously described S1 and S3 calls, two additional calls were identified: the impulsive S8 call and the slightly frequency-modulated S9 call. These two additional S8 and S9 calls are by far the most common grey whale sounds detected on tags, even though contemporary bottom-mounted acoustic recordings also collected from the lagoon in 2008 yielded no S8 or S9 calls. The new S8 and old S3 calls display similar spectral maxima, even though the S3 is a frequency-modulated harmonic call and the S8 is a broadband impulsive call. This spectral analysis provides evidence that these new call types are not artefacts arising from mechanical vibration or flow noise.

Grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) disappeared from the entire North Atlantic in still-mysterious circumstances. Here, we test the hypotheses that both species previously occurred in the Mediterranean Sea, an area not currently considered part of their historical range. We used ancient DNA barcoding and collagen fingerprinting methods to taxonomically identify a rare set of 10 presumed whale bones from Roman and pre-Roman archaeological sites in the Strait of Gibraltar region, plus an additional bone from the Asturian coast. We identified three right whales, and three grey whales, demonstrating that the ranges of both of these species historically encompassed the Gibraltar region, probably including the Mediterranean Sea as calving grounds. Our results significantly extend the known range of the Atlantic grey whale, and suggest that 2000 years ago, right and grey whales were common when compared with other whale species. The disappearance of right and grey whales from the Mediterranean region is likely to have been accompanied by broader ecosystem impacts, including the disappearance of their predators (killer whales) and a reduction in marine primary productivity. The evidence that these two coastal and highly accessible species were present along the shores of the Roman Empire raises the hypothesis that they may have formed the basis of a forgotten whaling industry. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To minimize effects on animal behavior, ecotourism operations must be carefully managed. Local management efforts that can be tailored to the specific area and animals may be more successful than broad-scale efforts that may be unknown to users of the environment, or inappropriate for the species. A profitable and growing whale-watch industry exists in Oregon, USA, but prior to this project, no state guidelines existed to protect animals and maintain sustainability of the industry. This project integrated research and outreach regarding gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) behavioral response to vessels, and translated results into community-developed vessel operation guidelines. We tracked whales and vessels in summer 2015 using non-invasive, shore-based theodolite and photo identification techniques. We monitored 2 sites along the Oregon coast with differing levels of vessel traffic for 4 weeks each. We analyzed tracks of whales using Markov chains to assess behavior state changes relative to location, individual, vessel presence, vessel type, and distance between whale and vessel. We documented significant differences in gray whale activity budgets between control and impact conditions, and between study sites. We did not observe significant differences in individual responses to vessel disturbance. Researchers and stakeholders collaboratively applied these results to create scientifically informed vessel operation guidelines that aim to balance the economic and educational gains of a whale-watch industry with adequate protection of the exploited whale population to enhance sustainability. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018","behavior; community engagement; ecotourism; Eschrichtius robustus; gray whale; marine mammal; Oregon; vessel interaction","anthropogenic effect; assessment method; conservation management; ecotourism; guideline; identification method; integrated approach; local participation; marine mammal; Markov chain; native species; profitability; sustainability; vessel; whale; Oregon; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,"Field work was completed by S.

The Eastern Pacific gray whale has recovered since the 1982 ban on commercial whaling, but the Western Pacific gray whale - once considered possibly extinct - consists of only about 200 individuals and is considered critically endangered by some international authorities. Herein, we use whole-genome sequencing to investigate the demographic history of gray whales from the Pacific and use environmental niche modelling to make predictions about future gene flow. Results: Our sequencing efforts and habitat niche modelling indicate that: i) western gray whale effective population sizes have declined since the last glacial maximum; ii) contemporary gray whale genomes, both eastern and western, harbor less autosomal nucleotide diversity than most other marine mammals and megafauna; iii) the extent of inbreeding, as measured by autozygosity, is greater in the Western Pacific than in the Eastern Pacific populations; and iv) future climate change is expected to open new migratory routes for gray whales. Conclusion: Our results indicate that gray whale genomes contain low nucleotide diversity and have been subject to both historical and recent inbreeding. Population sizes over the last million years likely peaked about 25,000 years before present and have declined since then. Our niche modelling suggests that novel migratory routes may develop within the next century and if so this could help retain overall genetic diversity, which is essential for adaption and successful recovery in light of global environmental change and past exploitation. © 2018 The Author(s).","Admixture; Cetacean; Demographic history; Relatedness; Runs-of-homozygosity","cetacean; climate change; conservation genetics; effective population size; endangered species; environmental change; gene flow; genome; Last Glacial Maximum; niche partitioning; population decline; prediction; relatedness; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; cluster analysis; ecosystem; genetic variation; genetics; genome; geography; homozygote; inbreeding; nucleotide sequence; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population density; statistics; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Base Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Genome; Geography; Homozygote; Inbreeding; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Statistics as Topic; Whales",,,,,,"This work was supported in part by Exxon Neftegas Limited and Sakhalin Energy Investment Company.

We also included one seasonal resident, eastern North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus, n = 12). This review summarized the distribution of daily locations from satellite-linked transmitters during two analysis periods, summer (May–November) and winter (December–April), and then examined the overlap among species. Six multi-species core use areas were identified during the summer period: 1) Chukotka/Bering Strait; 2) Norton Sound; 3) Kotzebue Sound; 4) the northeastern Chukchi Sea; 5) Mackenzie River Delta/Amundsen Gulf; and 6) Viscount Melville Sound. During the winter period, we identified four multi-species core use areas: 1) Anadyr Gulf/Strait; 2) central Bering Sea; 3) Nunivak Island; and 4) Bristol Bay. During the summer period, four of the six areas were centered on the greater Bering Strait region and the northwestern coast of Alaska and included most of the species we examined. The two remaining summer areas were in the western Canadian Arctic and were largely defined by the seasonal presence of Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock bowhead whales and Eastern Beaufort Sea stock beluga whales, whose distribution overlapped during both summer and winter periods. During the winter period, the main multi-species core use area was located near the Gulf of Anadyr and extended northwards through Anadyr and Bering Straits. This area is contained within the Bering Sea “green belt” an area of enhanced primary and secondary productivity in the Bering Sea. We also described available telemetry data and where they can be found as of 2017. These data are important for understanding ice-associated marine mammal movements and habitat use in the Pacific Arctic and should be archived, with appropriate metadata, to ensure they are available for future retrospective analyses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Balaena mysticetus; Bearded seal; Beaufort Sea; Beluga whale; Bering Sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Core area; Delphinapterus leucas; Distribution; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Pacific walrus; Pusa hispida; Ringed seal","Mammals; Satellites; Telemetering equipment; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Beluga whales; Bering sea; Bowhead whales; Chukchi Sea; Core area; Delphinapterus leucas; Distribution; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Pacific walrus; Pusa hispida; Ringed seals; Population distribution; biotelemetry; marine mammal; pinniped; range size; satellite data; seasonality; secondary production; species diversity; species occurrence; stock assessment; whale; Alaska; Amundsen Gulf; Anadyr Basin; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bering Strait; Bristol Bay; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Chukchi; Gulf of Anadyr; Kotzebue Sound; Norton Sound; Nunivak Island; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Phoca hispida; Phoca largha",,,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI","This analysis was conducted for the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR) and was funded in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Environmental Studies Program through Interagency Agreement No. M11PG00034 with the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory ( PMEL ).

In the western Atlantic, subfossil bones of 12 specimens of grey whale have previously been reported, whereas in the eastern Atlantic there are at least 25 subfossil remains of grey whale from the postglacial period, mostly from the Netherlands, along with one in Belgium, three in England and one in Sweden, ranging in age from approximately 10,000 to a few hundred years ago. Here we utilise a new method of identifying species from fragmentary bones, using collagen fingerprinting, to screen 373 cetacean remains from along the Norwegian coast, including the remains of at least one grey whale specimen dating to 1930–1750 years ago, which was recovered from Kringlevågen in the municipality of Solund (61°, 01″ N, 4°73″E). This find, confirmed by ancient DNA analysis, is the most northerly record of this locally extinct species and increases our understanding of grey whale palaeobiogeography in the North Atlantic. © 2017","Ancient proteins; Marine mammal bone identification; Species identification by collagen fingerprinting","Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,"Royal Society: UF120473","We are grateful to Tore Fredriksen and Beate Helle for preparing the figures and to Johnny Magnussen and Tore Fredriksen at the University of Bergen for extensive technical help in the osteological collection and to Hans Ahlgren at the University of Stockholm for DNA analysis.

This might be caused by genomic admixture that May have taken place among some rorquals. We present the genomes of six whales, including the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), to reconstruct a species tree of baleen whales and to identify phylogenetic conflicts. Evolutionary multilocus analyses of 34,192 genome fragments reveal a fast radiation of rorquals at 10.5 to 7.5 million years ago coinciding with oceanic circulation shifts. The evolutionarily enigmatic gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is placed among rorquals, and the blue whale genome shows a high degree of heterozygosity. The nearly equal frequency of conflicting gene trees suggests that speciation of rorqual evolution occurred under gene flow, which is best depicted by evolutionary networks. Especially in marine environments, sympatric speciation might be common; our results raise questions about how genetic divergence can be established.

Environmental biomonitoring with the use of seabirds and marine mammals, as a long-lived species, is used for global monitoring, since bioaccumulation in these organisms occurs throughout life. The environmental assessment of the Northwest Pacific marine ecosystems revealed that the levels of OCP contamination in this area are similar to the other subarctic regions of the World Ocean. © 2017","GC–MS; Marine mammals; Northwest Pacific; Organochlorines; Seabirds","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Ecosystems; Isomers; Marine biology; Marine pollution; Pesticides; Environmental assessment; Environmental biomonitoring; Environmental quality; Marine mammals; Northwest Pacific; Organochlorine pesticides; Organochlorines; Seabirds; Mammals; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; alpha hexachlorocyclohexane; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlorphenotane; lindane; organochlorine pesticide; chlorinated hydrocarbon; pesticide; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); gas chromatography; marine mammal; mass spectrometry; organochlorine pesticide; seabird; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; Cetacea; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; isomer; limit of detection; marine environment; marine species; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; prevalence; seabird; walrus; water pollutant; animal; Arctic; bird; ecosystem; metabolism; Pacific Ocean; procedures; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); Aethia cristatella; Aethia pusilla; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Fulmarus glacialis; Larus schistisagus; Mammalia; Oceanodroma; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Animals; Arctic Regions; Birds; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pacific Ocean; Pesticides; Walruses; Whales",,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane, 72-54-8; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene, 72-55-9; alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, 319-84-6; beta hexachlorocyclohexane, 319-85-7; chlorphenotane, 50-29-3; lindane, 58-89-9; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pesticides",,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-50-00034","We thank our colleagues from Pacific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO-Centre) for sampling during marine expeditions.

In this area, epibenthic mysid species are gray whales’ primary prey. The analysis indicates a top-down modification on habitat quality by this apex predator. Intense foraging in one or two summer season contributes to reduced prey resources available in the following summer. Years of heavy predation pressure were followed by at least one year of reduced foraging, probably allowing a reprieve in which the mysids could repopulate. Over the time span several patterns were noted including: boom-bust cycles; extended periods of reduced foraging; an overall declining trend of foraging whales using Clayoquot Sound, followed by a significant prey recovery in 2010. Life history patterns of mysids are discussed in the context of their ability to recover from predation, and how this recovery during a reprieve may buffer the intensity of foraging from the previous year. The continuing ability of mysids to recover from repeated and persistent removal will determine the use of Clayoquot Sound as a gray whale foraging area in the future. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

Because of the scarcity of fossil records of the Eschrichtiidae, their evolutionary history is not well understood. A finely preserved mysticete skeleton was recovered from the Lower Pleistocene (1.77-1.95 Ma) of Tokyo, Japan, in 1961. The fossil consists of a cranium, mandibles, cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, and forelimb bones, including scapula, humerus, radius, ulna and digit bones. Here, we describe and diagnose this fossil as a new species of the Eschrichtiidae, Eschrichtius akishimaensis sp. nov. This is the first fossil species of the genus Eschrichtius and suggests that at least two lineages represented by the modern species of Eschrichtius and the new species described here survived as late as the Early Pleistocene.

This study developed methods for systematic photographic assessment of long-term external consequences of tag placement, to determine potential differences in wound healing between species and tag types and thus advise future tagging efforts to possibly minimize undesirable side effects. Tag site appearance and healing characteristics were evaluated by two reviewers and a time series evaluated by five veterinarians from photographs during 995 postdeployment encounters with 34 gray and 63 blue whales tagged in the North Pacific. Blue whale resightings were less frequent, but spanned a longer time period due to earlier tag deployments than the more frequent gray whale follow-up observations. Swelling occurred in 74% of reencountered gray whales, with the highest frequency 6 mo postdeployment. Swellings were common in blue whales with early tag designs but rare with current models. Depressions occurred in 82% of gray and 71% of blue whales. This study demonstrates the value of follow-up studies of tagged animals and systematic scoring of photographs to quantitatively compare tag response. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy","Balaenoptera musculus; blue whale; Eschrichtius robustus; gray whale; North Pacific; satellite tag; wound healing","assessment method; behavioral response; habitat use; migration route; photograph; tagging; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"16111

Throughout their range, gray whales commonly become entangled or entrapped in fishing gear. In the western North Pacific, they have been killed in set nets and seen entangled with ropes and float lines. Signs of fishery interactions on 28 of 150 living whales photographed near Sakhalin Island were reported in a published study. We describe characteristics of RFE fisheries that might entangle WGWs, including fishing effort based on daily catch reports from 2010-2014. We make a preliminary qualitative assessment of entanglement risk, taking into account factors including (1) evidence that the gear type has entangled large whales, (2) fishing effort, and (3) geographic and temporal overlap between WGWs and fishing activity. Fishing for salmonids with pelagic gillnets is no longer allowed in the RFE, and as long as the prohibition is being followed such fishing poses no risk to WGWs. In contrast, the coastal salmon set net fishery poses a high entanglement risk off northeastern Sakhalin and Kamchatka where WGWs feed very close to shore, and that situation should be mitigated. Bottom-set gillnet, demersal longline, snurrevad (also called Danish seine), and trap and pot fisheries overlap substantially with WGW distribution, and bycatch in those fisheries should at least be monitored. More rigorous risk assessment would require additional information on WGW distribution and movements. © The authors and, outside the USA, the US Government 2018.","Distribution; Entanglement risk; Eschrichtius robustus; Fisheries; Russian Far East; Sakhalin Island; Western gray whale","cetacean; endangered species; environmental disturbance; environmental risk; fishery management; fishing gear; risk assessment; Russian Far East; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Salmonidae",,,,,,"Acknowledgements.

To address this negative bias, a species identification model was built from random forest (RF) classification trees using 199 identified entanglements ('model data'). Humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and gray whales Eschrichtius robustus represented 92% of identified entanglements; the remaining 8% were minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata, fin whales B. physalus, blue whales B. musculus, and sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus. Predictor variables included year, gear type, location, season, sea surface temperature, water depth, and a multivariate El Niño index. Crossvalidated species classifications were correct in 78% (155/199) of cases, significantly higher (p < 0.001, permutation test) than the 49% correct classification rate expected by chance. The RF model correctly classified 91% of humpback whale cases, 64% of gray whale cases, and 100% of sperm whale cases, but misclassified all minke, blue, and fin whale cases. The cross-validated RF classification-tree species model was used to classify 35 entanglements without species identifications ('novel data') and each case was assigned a probability of belonging to each of 6 model data species. This approach eliminates the negative bias associated with ignoring unidentified entanglements in species risk assessments. Applications to other wildlife studies where some detections are unidentified include fisheries bycatch, line-transect surveys, and large-whale vessel strikes. © The authors 2017.","Fishery entanglement; Gray whale; Humpback whale; Random forest; Species assignment","classification; endangered species; fishing gear; identification method; machine learning; risk assessment; whale; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,,"Andersen, D.E., Rongstad, O.J., Mytton, W.R., Line transect analysis of raptor abundance along roads (1985) Wildl Soc Bull, 13, pp. 533-539; Archer, E., (2016) rfPermute: estimate permutation p-values for random forest importance metrics, , https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rfPermute/rfPermute.pdf, R package version 2.1.5; Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem (2007) Fish Bull, 105, pp. 509-526; Bradford, A.L., Weller, D.W., Ivashchenko, Y.V., Burdin, A.M., Brownell, R.L., Jr., Anthropogenic scarring of western gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) (2009) Mar Mamm Sci, 25, pp. 161-175; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45, pp. 5-32; Breiman, L., Statistical modeling: the two cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author) (2001) Stat Sci, 16, pp. 199-231; Carretta, J.V., Wilkin, S., Muto, M.M., Wilkinson, K., (2013) Sources of human-related injury and mortality for U.S, , Pacific West Coast marine mammal stock assessments, 2007-2011.

In 2010 and again in 2015, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company conducted repeat (4D) seismic surveys to characterize changes to the subsurface from hydrocarbon production at the two platforms, required for efficient positioning of new wells; the original 3D seismic data had been acquired in 1997. Considerable effort went into the development for the 2010 seismic survey of a Monitoring and Mitigation Plan (MMP) that would recognize not just the necessity of preventing exposure of a critically endangered foraging population of gray whales to damaging or behaviourally interfering seismic pulse levels, but also the importance of collecting high quality acoustic and visual monitoring data to be used in studies of potential effects. This resulted in an effective framework for sound exposure estimation, measurement and mitigation and a highly structured shore based visual observation program capable of providing robust data on distribution and behaviour of the animals. Measured revisions and enhancements for the 2015 seismic survey MMP addressed some shortcomings of the earlier version for greater efficacy. © 2018 80th EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2018 Workshop Programme.",,"Geological surveys; Investments; Population statistics; Critically endangered; Energy investments; Hydrocarbon production; Mitigation plans; Potential effects; Russian federation; Visual monitoring; Visual observations; Seismology",,,,,,,,"Bröker, K., Gailey, G., Muir, J.E., Racca, R., Monitoring and impact mitigation during a 4D seismic survey near a population of gray whales off Sakhalin Island, Russia (2015) Endang Species Res, 28, pp. 187-208; Gailey, G., Ortega-Ortiz, J., A note on a computer-based system for theodolite tracking of cetaceans (2002) J Cetacean Res Manage, 4 (2), pp. 213-218; Gailey, G., Sychenko, O., McDonald, T., Racca, R., Rutenko, A., Bröker, K., Behavioural responses of western gray whales to a 4-D seismic survey off northeastern Sakhalin Island, Russia (2016) Endang Species Res, 30, pp. 53-71; Muir, J.E., Joy, R., Bychkov, Y., Bröker, K., Gailey, G., Vladimirov, V., Starodymov, S., Yakovlev, Y., Delineation of a coastal gray whale feeding area using opportunistic and systematic survey effort (2015) Endang Species Res, 29, pp. 147-160; Muir, J.E., Ainsworth, L., Joy, R., Racca, R., Bychkov, Y., Gailey, G., Vladimirov, V., Bröker, K., Distance from shore as an indicator of disturbance of gray whales during a seismic survey off Sakhalin Island, Russia (2015) Endang Species Res, 29, pp. 161-178; Nowacek, D.P., Thorne, L.H., Johnston, D.W., Tyack, P.L., Responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic noise (2007) Mammal Rev, 37, pp. 81-115; Southall, B.L., Bowles, A.E., Ellison, W.T., Finneran, J.J., Gentry, R.L., Greene, C.R., Jr., Kastak, D., Tyack, P.L., Marine mammal noise exposure criteria: Initial scientific recommendations (2007) Aquat Mamm, 33, pp. 411-521","Racca, R.R.; JASCO Applied SciencesCanada",,,"European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, EAGE","80th EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2018 Workshop Programme","10 June 2018 through 15 July 2018",,148616,,9789462822573,,,"English","EAGE Conf.

Gray whale is often described as a ""living fossil"". It is adapted to extreme marine conditions and has a high life expectancy (77 years). The assembly of a gray whale genome and transcriptome will allow to carry out further studies of whale evolution, longevity, and resistance to extreme environment. Results: In this work, we report the first de novo assembly and primary analysis of the E. robustus genome and transcriptome based on kidney and liver samples. The presented draft genome assembly is complete by 55% in terms of a total genome length, but only by 24% in terms of the BUSCO complete gene groups, although 10,895 genes were identified. Transcriptome annotation and comparison with other whale species revealed robust expression of DNA repair and hypoxia-response genes, which is expected for whales. Conclusions: This preliminary study of the gray whale genome and transcriptome provides new data to better understand the whale evolution and the mechanisms of their adaptation to the hypoxic conditions. © 2017 The Author(s).","DNA repair;

Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA  22203, United States","The shallow continental shelf waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas are the northernmost foraging grounds of North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Benthic amphipods are considered the primary prey of gray whales in these waters, although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been performed to support this assumption. Gray whale relative abundance, distribution, and behavior in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (69°–72°N, 155–169°W) were documented during aerial surveys in June-October 2009–2012. Concurrently, vessel-based benthic infaunal sampling was conducted in the area in July-August 2009–10, September 2011, and August 2012. Gray whales were seen in the study area each month that surveys were conducted, with the majority of whales feeding. Statistical analyses confirm that the highest densities of feeding gray whales were associated with high benthic amphipod abundance, primarily within 70 km of shore from Point Barrow to Icy Cape, in water &lt;50 m deep. Conversely, gray whales were not seen in 40-km×40-km cells containing benthic sampling stations with 85 m−2 or fewer amphipods. Continuing broad-scale aerial surveys in the Chukchi Sea and prey sampling near feeding gray whales will be an important means to monitor and document ongoing and predicted ecosystem changes. © 2016","Aerial survey; Alaska; Amphipods; Benthic foraging; Benthic-dominated ecosystem; Climate change; Eschrichtius robustus; Pelagic-dominated ecosystem; Sentinel","Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Feeding; Importance sampling; Population distribution; Tungsten; Aerial surveys; Alaska; Amphipods; Benthic foraging; Eschrichtius robustus; Sentinel; Surveys; abundance; aerial survey; benthic fauna; benthos; biomass; climate change; crustacean; foraging efficiency; ice cap; pelagic ecosystem; population distribution; Sentinel; shallow water; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Point Barrow; United States; Amphipoda; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata",,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS

Native peoples on the Oregon Coast were not known to hunt whales, but a humpback whale phalange with an embedded bone harpoon at the Par-Tee site (35CLT20) and ethnographic accounts raised the possibility of opportunistic whale hunting. We analyzed a suite of whale remains from Par-Tee and performed ancient DNA-based species identifications on 30 specimens. The assemblage includes gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus, 60.7% of the assemblage), humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae, 32.1%), minkes (Balaenoptera acutorostrata, 3.6%), and orcas (Orcinus orca, 3.6%). While the species composition is similar to those found in archaeological deposits from systematic whaling areas in Washington and Vancouver Island, bone modification patterns and element representation reveal important differences. Our analysis demonstrates that whales were likely a supplementary part of human subsistence at Par-Tee and, while opportunistic whale hunting likely occurred, it may have been secondary to scavenging and utilization of beached and/or drift whales.

Over the course of 129 effort-days (756.5 observation hours), 162 calves were counted, comprising 42, 41, and 79 calves in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. To estimate the number of undetected calves during the observation periods in 2006, detection probabilities were estimated by simultaneous and independent counts using a Huggins model. The detection probabilities ranged from 0.655 to 0.997. The number of calves estimated during effort periods were divided by their estimated detection probabilities, while the total number of calves were estimated by fitting a generalized additive model (GAM) to the passage rate (whales/h) and effort (time) data. The final gray whale calf abundance estimates were 451 (95% CI = 430, 513), 253 (95% CI= 245, 308), and 442 (95% CI = 396, 510) calves for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The estimates were lower than those reported for Piedras Blancas, California, during the same years, with one possible reason being that an important number of cow/calf pairs migrate too far from shore (>10 km) to be detected from the observation site used in this research. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy","calf abundance; Eastern Pacific gray whale; Eschrichtius robustus; Mexico","abundance estimation; migration; movement; numerical model; whale; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; California; Costa Rica; Ensenada; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Piedras Blancas National Park; Puntarenas; United States; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a, CONACYT

To test the potential generalizability of this technique for studies of stress and reproduction in large whales, we sought to determine whether all major classes of steroid and thyroid hormones are detectable in baleen, and whether these hormones are detectable in other mysticetes. Powdered baleen samples were recovered from single specimens of North Atlantic right, bowhead, blue (Balaenoptera [B.] musculus), sei (B. borealis), minke (B. acutorostrata), fin (B. physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whales. Hormones were extracted with a methanol vortex method, after which we tested all species with commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs, Arbor Assays) for progesterone, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, representing a wide array of steroid and thyroid hormones of interest for whale physiology research. In total, 64 parallelism tests (8 species × 8 hormones) were evaluated to verify good binding affinity of the assay antibodies to hormones in baleen. We also tested assay accuracy, although available sample volume limited this test to progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. All tested hormones were detectable in baleen powder of all species, and all assays passed parallelism and accuracy tests. Although only single individuals were tested, the consistent detectability of all hormones in all species indicates that baleen hormone analysis is likely applicable to a broad range of mysticetes, and that the EIA kits tested here perform well with baleen extract. Quantification of hormones in baleen may be a suitable technique with which to explore questions that have historically been difficult to address in large whales, including pregnancy and inter-calving interval, age of sexual maturation, timing and duration of seasonal reproductive cycles, adrenal physiology and metabolic rate. © The Author 2017.

Most of these species are listed by Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and thus international trade in their products is restricted. Therefore, commercial sale of unfossilized marine mammal bone is largely prohibited. Sale of Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) bone is legal, however, since the animals have been extinct since 1768. The current study outlines a simple test that can identify bone which is bona fide Steller's sea cow-and thus legal to sell. The test uses a segment of the D-loop of the mitochondrion, which has the power to exclude samples which are not specifically H. gigas or a Sirenian relative. The test also includes a reliable method to extract DNA from bone and amplify it using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Extracted DNA was sequenced to verify that only manatees, dugongs, elephants, and their relatives produced a positive result. Using this test, products being sold commercially as legal ""mermaid ivory"" (Steller sea cow bone) were found to actually come from gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), and white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) bone. This finding indicates that government agencies should monitor bones being sold as ""mermaid ivory"" because protected species are being illegally traded under the guise of being legal Steller's sea cow bone. © 2017 Crerar, Freeman, Domning and Parsons.","DNA; Hydrodamalis gigas; Illegal trade; Sirenian; Steller's sea cow; Wildlife products",,,,,,,,,"Baker, C., Cipriano, F., Palumbi, S., Molecular genetic identification of whale and dolphin products from commercial markets in Korea and Japan (1996) Mol.

To better understand the biology of the gray whale Eschrichtius robustus (Lilljeborg, 1861), we sequenced the genome and produced an assembly that contains ∼95% of the genes known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes. From this assembly, we annotated 22,711 genes and identified 2,057,254 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using this assembly, we generated a curated list of candidate genes potentially subject to strong natural selection, including genes associated with os-moregulation, oxygen binding and delivery, and other aspects of marine life. From these candidate genes, we queried 92 autosomal protein-coding markers with a panel of 96 SNPs that also included 2 sexing and 2 mitochondrial markers. Genotyp-Genotyp-ing error rates, calculated across loci and across 69 intentional replicate samples, were low (0.021%), and observed het-erozygosity was 0.33 averaged over all autosomal markers. This level of variability provides substantial discriminatory power across loci (mean probability of identity of 1.6 × 10 -25 and mean probability of exclusion &gt;0.999 with neither parent known), indicating that these markers provide a powerful means to assess parentage and relatedness in gray whales. We found 29 unique multilocus genotypes represented among our 36 biopsies (indicating that we inadvertently sampled 7 whales twice). In total, we compiled an individual data set of 28 western gray whales (WGSs) and 1 presumptive eastern gray whale (EGW). The lone EGW we sampled was no more ing or less related to the WGWs than expected by chance alone. The gray whale genomes reported here will enable comparative studies of natural selection in cetaceans, and the SNP markers should be highly informative for future studies of gray whale evolution, population structure, demography, and relatedness. © 2017 The University of Chicago.",,"array; comparative study; data set; eukaryote; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genome; genomics; heterozygosity; natural selection; protein; whale; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eukaryota; animal; Cetacea; genetic variation; genetics; genome; genotype; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; Animals; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Species Specificity; Whales",,,,,,"We thank the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and Aimée Lang for curating the 2011 western gray whale samples provided via the IWC.

Development of oil and gas fields in northeastern Sakhalin, Russia, is a concern, because they overlap with WGW feeding grounds. Some WGW migrate ~10 000 km from feeding grounds around Sakhalin Island (Russia), to breeding grounds in Baja California (BajaC; Mexico) and possibly ~6000 km to the South China Sea (China). We developed a WGW female bioenergetics model to examine potential consequences of energy lost from foraging cessation caused by anthropogenic disturbance, and compared it to eastern gray whales (EGW). Energy loss was then linked to potential reductions in reproduction and survival. Mean total energy requirements were 11 and 15% greater for WGW breeding in BajaC and China, respectively, compared to EGW, due to longer migration distance (25%) to BajaC and higher metabolic rates at foraging grounds. However, this difference is minimal for EGW that use the northern extent of their foraging range. On average, WGW breeding in BajaC and China need 9 and 17% more energy for survival than EGW. Our model predicts that WGW mortality would likely occur at 38 to 40% annual energetic loss. Long-term yearly energy loss of < 30% would re - duce population growth due to lower reproductive rates. Ongoing yearly energy losses of > 30% would result in adult female mortality the first year, followed by lower reproductive rates of survivors. Our model suggests that energy losses of > 30% caused by disturbance should be considered a threshold for concern for this Critically Endangered population. © The author 2017.","Bioenergetics; Disturbance costs; Energy loss; Eschrichtius robustus; Foraging costs; Metabolic rate; Migration costs; Reproductive costs; Western gray whale","anthropogenic effect; bioenergetics; disturbance; endangered species; foraging behavior; metabolism; reproductive success; threshold; whale; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Anderson, S.S., Fedak, M.A., The energetics of sexual success of grey seals and comparison with the costs of reproduction in other pinnipeds (1987) Reproductive energetics in mammals, pp. 319-339. , In: Loudon ASI, Racey PA (eds).

Most mitigation efforts attempt to minimize injury by enabling animals to move away as noise levels are increased gradually. Recent experiences demonstrate that this approach is inadequate or even counterproductive for small, localized marine mammal populations, for which displacement of animals may itself cause harm. Seismic surveys within the ranges of harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena in California and Maui dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori maui in New Zealand highlight the need to explicitly consider biological risks posed by displacement during survey planning, monitoring, and mitigation. Consequences of displacement are poorly understood, but likely include increased stress and reduced foraging success, with associated effects on survival and reproduction. In some cases, such as the Critically Endangered Maui dolphin, displacement by seismic activities risks exposing the re -maining 55 dolphins to bycatch in nearby fisheries. Similar concerns about military and industrial activities exist for island-associated species such as melon-headed whales Peponocephala electra in Hawai'i; shelf-break associated species such as Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris off the US Atlantic coast, and whales foraging in coastal habitats, such as the Critically Endangered western gray whale Eschrichtius robustus. We present an expanded framework for considering disturbance effects that acknowledges scientific uncertainty, providing managers and operators a more robust means of assessing and avoiding potential harm associated with both displacement and direct effects of intense anthropogenic noise exposure. © The authors and (outside the USA) the US Government 2017.","Anthropogenic noise; Impact assessment; Marine mammals; Mitigation; Monitoring; Small populations","anthropogenic source; endangered species; environmental impact assessment; marine mammal; noise pollution; pollution effect; Animalia; Cephalorhynchus hectori; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Peponocephala; Peponocephala electra; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Ziphiidae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,,"Aguilar de Soto, N., Kight, C., Physiological effects of noise.

Together these goals establish a baseline of gray whale behaviour during summer and autumn in the region of the Makah Tribe’s proposed whale hunt. From 1984 to 2011, a total of 225 unique gray whales were observed, with 49% being observed again in a future year. There was significant variability in observation rates of gray whales by month and year. During the feeding season, the observation rate increased to a peak in August in the north research segment in the Pacific Ocean and to a peak in October in research segments in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and in the southern research segment in the Pacific Ocean. Gray whales were most commonly observed at depths of 5–15m over rocky substrates and often near kelp forests, although the locations where they fed were dynamic by both month and year. Some whales habitually returned to northwest Washington, however the average whale in the study area was observed in only 31.6% (SE = 1.6%) of the possible years in which they could have been observed. Gray whales in the study area had an average minimum tenure (residency time) of 24.8 days out of a possible 183 days of the feeding season. A discovery curve analysis did not reach an asymptote over the 27 years of this study showing that there is no population closure to the research area. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that even though northwest Washington is an important feeding area, most Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) gray whales do not have strong fidelity to this one region within the IWC defined PCFG range. The findings presented in this paper provide a baseline for evaluating the impact of Makah hunting activities on the behaviour of PCFG whales that utilise the Makah’s traditional hunting area once hunting activities resume. © 2017 International Whaling Commission.

Aerial surveys were conducted from late August to mid-September during the period 2007-11 for a total of 171.1 hours flown. In addition to the focal species, observed species included gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus; one humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas; ringed seals, Phoca hispida; bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus; walrus, Odobenus rosmarus; and polar bears, Ursus maritimus. Small pinnipeds, such as ringed seal and spotted seals, Phoca largha, were often difficult to differentiate and identify to species given the relatively high survey altitude of 310 m (1,000 ft). Habitat partitioning was evident among the cetacean species observed in greatest numbers: bowhead, gray, and beluga whales. Abundance estimates during this time period ranged from 22 (CV 0.80) to 213 (CV 0.30) bowhead whales, 1 (CV 1.01) to 18 (CV 0.28) gray whales, and 0 to 948 (CV 0.66) beluga whales. Standard deviation ellipses showed each species occupied a unique region within the study area with slight overlaps occurring in some years. Bowhead distribution was oriented along the barrier islands and 20 m isobath on the continental shelf and also included parts of the Barrow Canyon and shelf break that were close to shore. Gray whale distribution oriented along the Barrow Canyon shelf break near the 50 m isobath; while beluga distribution ellipses centered over Barrow Canyon and offshore slope waters. A four-parameter presence-absence model (bathymetry, bathymetric slope, distance from shore, and distance from the shelf break) found both distance from shore and shelf break were significant in predicting the presence of bowhead whales. All four parameters were significant in predicting gray whale presence. Only bathymetry was significant in predicting beluga whale presence. During the 5-year study, 664 unique bowhead whales were identified from 1,415 photographic images. Observers noted feeding behavior during 7-50% of sightings and 15-49% of photographed whales exhibited feeding behavior in any given year. Of the individual whales that were visually or photographically identified as feeding, 81-90% were in shelf waters, and the majority of those were clustered around the 20 m isobath. More feeding behavior was observed and photographed during years when most sightings occurred on the shelf (2007, 2009, and 2010) but not necessarily in years when bowheads were most abundant in the study area (e.g., 2008 and 2010). The lowest percent feeding both visually and photographically occurred in 2008, the only year whale swim direction was predominately westerly, and open mouth (skim) feeding behavior was not observed. Although the paucity of individual resightings (based on photographic recaptures) between survey days (3 matches out of 664 identified whales) suggested very low residence times, the photogrammetric sample (654 whales) was largely comprised of juveniles (65%). Young whales typically are unmarked and, therefore, not matched (only 3-6% were highly or moderately marked in at least one zone on the body). All intrayear matched whales moved east of their original sighting location, which was not expected so close to the westbound fall migration. The BOWFEST aerial study provides a 5-year record of late summer presence of cetaceans in the western Beaufort Sea, adding to the growing body of knowledge on these species and their habitat preferences in this region. This information is particularly important since the western Beaufort Sea is undergoing rapid change as the bowhead whale population continues to grow, other species extend their ranges and increase their numbers in the area, and industrial activity, commercial fishing, and shipping operations are expected to increase in the Arctic as sea ice decreases.",,"abundance estimation; aerial survey; continental shelf; feeding behavior; habitat selection; habitat use; migratory behavior; sea ice; shelf break; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; swath bathymetry; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus; Phoca hispida; Phoca largha; Pinnipedia; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y.H., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63, pp. 179-194; Braham, H.W., Dahlheim, M.E., Killer whales in Alaska documented in the platforms of opportunity program (1982) Rep.

Bowhead whales use the eastern Chukchi Sea primarily for migrating between the Beaufort Sea and the Bering Sea, while gray whales use the area to feed on locally abundant benthic amphipods and other prey. Bowhead whales were observed during all survey months and were distributed up to 300 km offshore west and southwest of Point Barrow, Alaska, but without a defined migratory corridor in either summer (July-August) or fall (September-October). Bowhead whale sighting rates (whales per km on effort) were highest in the shelf/trough (51 – 200 m North) depth zone in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in both summer and fall. This pattern was reflected in habitat selection ratios, which found bowhead whales in summer and fall selecting primarily shelf/trough habitat in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, with shelf habitat (36 – 50 m) being preferred secondarily. Gray whales were observed in all survey months and were distributed primarily within ~95 km of shore between Point Barrow and Icy Cape in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, and about 60 – 115 km southwest of Point Hope in the southern Chukchi Sea. In both summer and fall, gray whale sighting rates and habitat selection ratios were highest in the shelf/trough (51 – 200 m South) depth zone in the southern Chukchi Sea. In the northeastern part of the study area, gray whale sighting rates and habitat selection ratios both identified coastal habitat (≤ 35 m) as preferred habitat in summer and shelf/trough (51 – 200 m North) as preferred habitat in fall. Distribution and habitat associations of bowhead and gray whales remained similar over the 34-year time span with one exception: gray whale preference for shelf/trough habitat in the southern Chukchi Sea is now evident throughout summer and fall, whereas three decades ago gray whale preference for that area was limited to fall only. © 2016, The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aerial survey; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Chukchi sea; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding; Gray whale; Habitat","aerial survey; amphipod; comparative study; feeding behavior; habitat selection; line transect; marine mammal; migration route; migratory behavior; population distribution; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Point Barrow; Point Hope; United States; Amphipoda; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Aerts, L.A.M., McFarland, A.E., Watts, B.H., Lomac-Macnair, K.S., Seiser, P.E., Wisdom, S.S., Kirk, A.V., Schudel, C.A., Marine mammal distribution and abundance in an offshore sub-region of the northeastern Chukchi Sea during the open-water season (2013) Continental Shelf Research, 67, pp. 116-126. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2013.04.020; Arrigo, K.R., Van Dijken, G.L., Continued increases in Arctic Ocean primary production (2015) Progress in Oceanography, 136, pp. 60-70. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2015.05.002; Arrigo, K.R., Van Dijken, G., Pabi, S., Impact of a shrinking Arctic ice cover on marine primary production (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GL035028; Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63 (2), pp. 179-194. , http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic973; Azzara, A.J., Wang, H., Rutherford, D., (2015) A 10-Year Projection of Maritime Activity in the U.S. Arctic Region, p. 73. , Washington, D.C.: The International Council on Clean Transportation; Berline, L., Spitz, Y.H., Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Euphausiid transport in the western Arctic Ocean (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 360, pp. 163-178. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07387; Bluhm, B.A., Gradinger, R., Regional variability in food availability for Arctic marine mammals (2008) Ecological Applications, 18, pp. S77-S96. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0562.1; Bluhm, B.A., Coyle, K.O., Konar, B., Highsmith, R., High gray whale relative abundances associated with an oceanographic front in the south-central Chukchi Sea (2007) Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 54 (23-26), pp. 2919-2933. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.08.015; Bockstoce, J.R., Burns, J.J., Commercial whaling in the North Pacific sector.

The subject of this research is the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) that inhabits the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean. The gray whale of the Okhotsk–Korean or the Western Gray Whale (WGW) population is classified as critically endangered according to criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); current estimate of the total population numbers is approximately 150 individuals. The main feeding area where western gray whales spend their summer-fall period, constitutes a narrow (with depths no greater than 50 m) sea area that runs alongside the coastline over approximately 100 km, and is located in the north-eastern part of the Sakhalin Island. Unlike other cetaceans, the gray whale feed on benthic organisms — the primary components of their diet are bottom-dwelling crustaceans belonging to the groups of Amphipoda and Isopoda. Systematic research into the western gray whale, initiated by a group of oil companies working offshore Sakhalin, has been going on since 1997. We analyzed the associativity between the spatial distributions of the western gray whales and the biomass of the benthic organisms serving as their food source over the period of 2002–2011. The analysis was conducted using GIS technologies. Cartographic alignment of whale occurrence distribution and the abundance of food benthos demonstrate the high degree of their spatial associativity, thus indicating the important role of the food factor in the formation of the whale spatial distribution. Maximum values of cumulative yearly estimates of sighted gray whales are associated with the areas with the maximum density of benthos. The analysis of the associativity dynamics shows that most attractive for whales are shallow vast fields with high and relatively evenly distributed Amphipoda biomass. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Feeding areas; GIS-technologies; Gray whale Eschrichtius robustus; Sakhalin Island; Spatial distribution",,,,,,,,,"Adrianov, A.V., Contemporary issues of the marine biological diversity research (2004) Mar.

This alteration has resulted in an opening of habitat for subarctic species of baleen whales, many of which are recovering in number from severe depletions from commercial whaling in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specifically, humpback, fin and minke whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, Balaenoptera physalus and Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are now regularly reported during summer and autumn in the southern Chukchi Sea. These predators of zooplankton and forage fishes join the seasonally resident grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and the arctic-endemic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in the expanding open-ocean habitat of the Pacific Arctic. Questions arising include: (i) what changes in whale-prey production and delivery mechanisms have accompanied the loss of sea ice, and (ii) how are these five baleen whale species partitioning the expanding ice-free habitat? While there has been no programme of research specifically focused on these questions, an examination of seasonal occurrence, foraging plasticity and (for bowhead whales) body condition suggests that the current state of Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem may be 'boom times' for baleen whales. These favourable conditions may be moderated, however, by future shifts in ecosystem structure and/or negative impacts to cetaceans related to increased commercial activities in the region. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This specimen is identified as belonging to the extant coronulid species Cryptolepas rhachianecti, currently known as an epizoic symbiont of the grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. This find represents the first occurrence of C. Rhachianecti outside the North Pacific, and the first one as a (sub)fossil. In view of the fact that E. Robustus, which is currently confined to the North Pacific, is known as a subfossil from the northeastern Atlantic between late Late Pleistocene (c. 45,000 years ago) and historical (c. 1700 AD) times, we propose a similar (late Quaternary) age for the isolated compartment. The find indicates that the extinct late Quaternary northeastern Atlantic population of E. Robustus was infected by Cryptolepas rhachianecti. Our find is, therefore, compatible with the hypothesis of an ancient grey whale migration route running between the subtropical/temperate waters of the northeast Atlantic (or Mediterranean Basin), and the cold waters of the Baltic Sea (or southern Arctic Ocean), through the southern North Sea. Finally, we discuss the systematic placement of the fossil barnacle species Cryptolepas murata and propose the possibility of its removal from the genus Cryptolepas pending further investigations. © 2016 Magnolia Press.","Cetacean migrations; Commensalism; Mysticeti; North Sea; Palaeobiogeography; Thoracica","anatomy and histology; animal; animal structures; barnacle; body size; Cetacea; classification; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; Netherlands; organ size; parasitology; physiology; symbiosis; Animal Structures; Animals; Body Size; Ecosystem; Netherlands; Organ Size; Symbiosis; Thoracica; Whales",,,,,,,,"Aaris-Sørensen, K., Rasmussen, K.L., Linze, C., Petersen, K.S., Late Pleistocene and Holocene whale remains (Cetacea) from Denmark and adjacent countries: Species, distribution, chronology, and trace element concentrations (2010) Marine Mammal Science, 26 (2), pp. 253-281. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2009.00356.x; Alter, S.E., Meyer, M., Post, K., Czechowski, P., Gravlund, P., Gaines, C., Rosenbaum, H.C., Hofreiter, M., Climate impacts on transocean dispersal and habitat in gray whales from the Pleistocene to 2100 (2015) Molecular Ecology, 24 (7), pp. 1510-1522. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.13121; Bianucci, G., Landini, W., Buckeridge, J., Whale barnacles and Neogene cetacean migration routes (2006) New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, 49 (1), pp. 115-120. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2006.9515152; Bianucci, G., Di Celma, C., Landini, W., Buckeridge, J., Palaeoecology and taphonomy of an extraordinary whale barnacle accumulation from the Plio-Pleistocene of Ecuador (2006) Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology, 242 (3), pp. 326-342. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.07.004; Bisconti, M., Morphology and phylogenetic relationships of a new eschrichtiid genus (Cetacea: Mysticeti) from the Early Pliocene of northern Italy (2008) Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 153 (1), pp. 161-186. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2008.00374.x; Bisconti, M., Varola, A., The oldest eschrichtiid mysticete and a new morphological diagnosis of Eschrichtiidae (gray whales) (2006) Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 112 (3), pp. 447-457. , http://dx.doi.org/10.13130/2039-4942/6352; Borowski, G.H., (1781) Gemeinnützige Naturgeschichte des Thieirreichs., 2, 21p. , Gottlieb August Lange, Berlin; Bradford, A.L., Weller, D.W., Burdin, A.M., Brownell, R.L., Jr., Using barnacle and pigmentation characteristics to identify gray whale calves on their feeding grounds (2011) Marine Mammal Science, 27 (3), pp. 644-651. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00413.x; Bryant, P.J., Dating remains of gray whales form the eastern North Atlantic (1995) Journal of Mammalogy, 76 (3), pp. 857-861. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382754; Bronn, H., (1831) Italiens Tertiär-Gebilde und Deren Organische Einschlusse, 176p. , Gross, Heidelberg; Burmeister, H.I., (1834) Beiträge Zur Naturgeschichte der Rankenfüsser (Cirripedia), 60p. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.8822, G.

These data along with temporal, spatial and environmental non-acoustic impact variables were used in multivariate analyses (MVAs) to investigate effects of sound on i) whale distance from shore, ii) occupancy/abundance and iii) behavioral responses. Sound metrics were estimated through modelling on a grid of density surface cells and on individual whale paths. Acoustic recordings provided refinement factors for modelling results. Distance from shore analyses found no evidence that seismic pulses resulted in a distributional shift. Density MVAs found no significant changes in whale occupancy associated with seismic sound exposure, but found a weak association between decreased densities and a rise-fall pattern of sound exposure over the previous 3 days. These MVAs were limited by sample sizes, and shifts could also reflect changes in prey distribution (not monitored). Behavioral analyses found no significant association between response variables and noise covariates including sound from vessels; however, power analyses on behavioral data found sample sizes to be insufficient to detect small to moderate changes. © 2016 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic noise;

We investigate the local economic value of Eastern Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) to two communities in Baja California Sur, Mexico, that benefit from nature-based tourism associated with the whales. Using a producer side approach and data for 2006, we estimate the economic rent associated with whale watching in 2006 and then examine the distribution of that rent among local stakeholders. We find a substantial local value associated with the presence of gray whales, with the largest share (two-thirds) going to the whale watching owner-operators. Our findings suggest that increasing the whale watching price in 2006 would have been a cost-effective strategy for increasing the rent captured locally from whale watching. Finally, we conclude with a brief assessment of developments since 2006. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bahia Magdalena; Environmental valuation; Gray whale; Species conservation","contingent valuation; ecological economics; economic rent; economic theory; environmental assessment; habitat conservation; species conservation; tourism; Baja California Sur; Magdalena Bay; Mexico [North America]; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 410-2005-1720","Special thanks go to the whale watching business owners of Puerto San Carlos and Puerto Adolfo Lopez Mateo for sharing proprietary information and valuable business insights.

They migrate to high-latitude feeding grounds each spring. Their main feeding grounds in the Arctic include the Chirikov Basin, the northeastern Chukchi Sea from Pt. Hope to Cape Lisburne and Pt. Lay to Pt. Barrow, and the northwestern Chukchi Sea along the Chukotka coast. Although sightings are rare in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, we observed three gray whales in two groups in this area in September 2014. A mud plume was observed near one of the whales, suggesting the animal had been feeding. In the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, large-scale monitoring of the distributions of marine mammals has been continuously conducted since 1979; however, there has been less monitoring in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Therefore, it is necessary to record opportunistic sightings, such as those described here. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.","Eastern Beaufort Sea; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding; Gray whale","environmental monitoring; feeding ground; migration; plume; population distribution; vertical distribution; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bering Sea; Chirikov Basin; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,"We acknowledge the captain, crew, and researchers on board on the Canadian icebreaker Amundsen for their endless support and hard work during the 2014 cruise.

To date, only toothed whales (Odontoceti) have been analyzed by comparative chromosome painting. Here, we studied the karyotype of a representative of baleen whales, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus, Mysticeti), by Zoo-FISH with dromedary camel and human chromosome-specific probes. We confirmed a high degree of karyotype conservation and found an identical order of syntenic segments in both branches of cetaceans. Yet, whale chromosomes harbor variable heterochromatic regions constituting up to a third of the genome due to the presence of several types of repeats. To investigate the cause of this variability, several classes of repeated DNA sequences were mapped onto chromosomes of whale species from both Mysticeti and Odontoceti. We uncovered extensive intrapopulation variability in the size of heterochromatic blocks present in homologous chromosomes among 3 individuals of the gray whale by 2-step differential chromosome staining. We show that some of the heteromorphisms observed in the gray whale karyotype are due to distinct amplification of a complex of common cetacean repeat and heavy satellite repeat on homologous autosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate localization of the telomeric repeat in the heterochromatin of both gray and pilot whale (Globicephala melas, Odontoceti). Heterochromatic blocks in the pilot whale represent a composite of telomeric and common repeats, while heavy satellite repeat is lacking in the toothed whale consistent with previous studies. © 2016 S.

The survey area was adjacent to the only known near-shore feeding ground of the Critically Endangered population of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus in the western Pacific south of the Aleutian Islands. This study examined the effectiveness of efforts to minimize the behavioural responses of the whales to vessel proximity and sound during the survey. Two shore-based behavioural observation teams monitored whale movements and respirations pre-, during and post-seismic survey. Theodolite tracking and focal-animal follow methods were used to collect behavioural data. Mixed linear models were used to examine deviations from 'normal' patterns in 10 movement and 7 respiration response variables in relation to vessel proximity, vessel/ whale relative orientations and 8 received sound metrics to examine if seismic survey sound and/or vessel activity influenced the whales' behaviour. Behavioural state and water depth were the best 'natural' predictors of whale movements and respiration. After considering natural variation, none of the response variables were significantly associated with seismic survey or vessel sounds. A whale's distance from shore and its orientation relative to the closest vessel were found to be significantly influenced by vessel proximity, which suggested some non-sound related disturbance. The lack of evidence that the whales responded to seismic survey sound and vessel traffic by changing either their movement or respiration patterns could indicate that the current mitigation strategy is effective. However, power analyses suggest that our sample sizes were too small to detect subtle to moderate changes in gray whale behaviour. © The authors 2016.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Behaviour; Movement; Respiration; Seismic survey; Western gray whale","anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; endangered species; environmental disturbance; feeding ground; movement; respiration; seismic survey; species conservation; whale; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behaviour: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Baillie, J.E.M., Hilton-Taylor, C., Stuart, S.N., (2004) 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: a global species assessment, , IUCN, Gland; Beale, C.M., The behavioral ecology of disturbance responses (2007) J Comp Psychol, 20, pp. 111-120; Beale, C.M., Monaghan, P., Behavioural responses to human disturbance: a matter of choice (2004) Anim Behav, 68, pp. 1065-1069; Bejder, L., Samuels, A., Whitehead, H., Finn, H., Allen, S., Impact assessment research: use and misuse of habituation, sensitisation and tolerance in describing wildlife responses to anthropogenic stimuli (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 395, pp. 177-185; Bogoslovskaya, L.S., Votrogov, L.M., Semenova, T.N., Feeding habits of the gray whale off Chukotka.

Acoustic responses of whales to both naturally occurring and artificially increased levels of noise were documented during sound playback experimentation in San Ignacio Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Nine acoustic parameters were examined and compared between experimental con - ditions: calling rates, call types, frequency range of calls (Hz), call peak frequencies (Hz), call received levels (dB re 1 μPa), call duration (s), percentage of calls showing frequency modulation, number of pulses per call, and call repetition rates (number of pulses s-1). Multiple acoustic strategies were employed by whales which enabled them to minimize the detrimental effect that noise had on their underwater signaling. When different sources of noise were added to their habitat, a corresponding increase was observed in calling rates, call received levels, frequency-modulated signals, number of pulses per call, and call repetition rates. Our results show that gray whales vary their calling behavior dependent upon the noise source, duration, and presentation. Acoustic responses to noise may also differ based on the behavioral activity of the whale (e.g. breeding, migrating, feeding) and on the habitat the whale is occupying (shallow lagoons, coastal or pelagic waters). Background noise (both natural and man-made) has a profound effect on the acoustic behavior of this coastal species and calling is modified to optimize signal transmission and reception. Whether these modifications ensure that effective communication takes place in higher noise situations, without causing detrimental effects to individuals in the long term, remains to be tested. © The USA Government 2016.","Acoustic behavior; Gray whale; Noise; Sound playback","acoustics; calling behavior; signaling; underwater noise; whale; Baja California Sur; Mexico [North America]; San Ignacio Lagoon; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Barber, J.R., Crooks, K.R., Fristrup, K.M., The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms (2010) Trends Ecol Evol, 25, pp. 180-189; Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald, T.L., Thode, A.M., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates: evidence for two behavioral thresholds (2015) PLOS ONE, 10; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principles of animal communication, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (2011) Principles of animal communication, 2nd edn, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA; Brumm, H., Slabbekoorn, H., Acoustic communication in noise (2005) Adv Stud Behav, 35, pp. 151-209; Bryant, P.J., Lafferty, C.M., Lafferty, S.K., Reoccupation of Laguna Guerrero Negro, Baja California, Mexico, by gray whales (1984) The gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, pp. 375-387. , Jones ML, Swartz SL, Leatherwood S (eds) Academic Press, New York, NY; Castellote, M., Fossa, F., Measuring acoustic activity as a method to evaluate welfare in captive beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (2006) Aquat Mamm, 32, pp. 325-333; Castellote, M., Clark, C.W., Lammers, M.O., Acoustic and behavioural changes by fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in response to shipping and airgun noise (2012) Biol Conserv, 147, pp. 115-122; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Hatch, L., Van Parijs, S.M., Frankel, A., Ponirakis, D., Acoustic masking in marine ecosystems: intuitions, analysis, and implication (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 395, pp. 201-222; Creel, S., Fox, J.E., Hardy, A., Sands, J., Garrott, R., Peterson, R., Snowmobile activity and glucocorticoid stress responses in wild wolves and elk (2002) Conserv Biol, 16, pp. 809-814; Dahlheim, M.E., (1987) Bio-acoustics of the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), , PhD thesis, University of British Columbia, Vancouver; Dahlheim, M.E., Fisher, H.D., Schempp, J., Sound produc tion by the gray whale and ambient noise levels in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur, Mexico (1984) The gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, pp. 511-541. , Jones MJ, Swartz SL, Leatherwood S (eds) Academic Press, New York, NY; Di Iorio, L., Clark, C.W., Exposure to seismic survey alters blue whale acoustic communication (2010) Biol Lett, 6, pp. 51-54; Dunlop, R.A., Cato, D.H., Noad, M.J., Evidence of a Lombard response in migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2014) J Acoust Soc Am, 136, pp. 430-437; Finley, K.J., Miller, G.W., Davis, R.A., Greene, C.R., Reactions of belugas, (Delphinapterus leucas), and narwhals, (Monodon monoceros), to ice-breaking ships in the Canadian High Arctic (1990) Can Bull Fish Aquat Sci, 224, pp. 97-117; Fish, J.F., Vania, J.S., Killer whale, Orcinus orca, sounds repel white whales, Delphinapterus leucas (1971) Fish Bull, 69, pp. 531-535; Hildebrand, A., Anthropogenic and natural sources of ambient noise in the ocean (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 395, pp. 5-20; Jefferson, T.A., Stacey, P.J., Baird, R.W., A review of killer whale interactions with other marine mammals: predation to co-existence (1991) Mammal Rev, 21, pp. 151-180; Jones, M.L., Swartz, S.L., Demography and phenology of gray whales and evaluation of whale-watching activities in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur, Mexico (1984) The gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, pp. 309-374. , Jones ML, Swartz SL, Leatherwood S (eds) Academic Press, New York, NY; Karlsen, J.D., Bisther, A., Lyderse, C., Haug, T., Kovacs, K.M., Summer vocalizations of adult male white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in Svalbard, Norway (2002) Polar Biol, 25, pp. 808-817; Kight, C.R., Swaddle, J.P., How and why environmental noise impacts animals: an integrative, mechanistic review (2011) Ecol Lett, 14, pp. 1052-1061; Lésage, V., Barrette, C., Kingsley, M.C.S., Sjare, B., The effect of vessel noise on the vocal behavior of belugas in the St. Lawrence River Estuary, Canada (1999) Mar Mamm Sci, 15, pp. 65-84; Ljungblad, D.K., Moore, S.E., Killer whales (Orcinus orca) chasing gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Northern Bering Sea (1983) Arctic, 36, pp. 361-364; Lombard, E., Le signe de l'élévation de la voix (1911) Ann Mal Oreil Larynx, 37, pp. 101-199; Malme, C.I., Miles, P.R., Miller, G.W., Richardson, W.J., Roseneau, D.G., Thompson, D.H., Greene, C.R., Jr., (1989) Analysis and ranking of the acoustic disturbance potential of petroleum industry activities and other sources of noise in the environment of marine mammals in Alaska, , Report produced for US Minerals Management.

Small populations are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic threats, in - cluding acoustic disturbance from industrial activities such as seismic surveys. Here, we investigated if sound exposure from a 16 d seismic survey displaced gray whales Eschrichtius robustus from their coastal feeding area offnortheastern Sakhalin Island, Russia. We conducted multiple shore-based surveys per day, weather permitting, and created daily 1 km2 density surfaces that provided snapshots of gray whale distribution throughout the seismic activity. A Bayesian spatiotemporal analysis was used to examine possible effects of characteristics of sound exposure from seismic airguns on gray whale occupancy and abundance. Models suggested highest occupancy in areas with moderate sound exposure. Slightly decreased densities were associated with sound exposure when the pattern for the previous 3 d was high sound on Day 2 and low sound on Days 1 and 3. Our findings should be interpreted with caution, given the low number of positive densities. This was due to success of the primary mitigation measure, which was to conduct the seismic survey as early in the feeding season as possible when few gray whales would be present. It is also possible that observed differences in occupancy and density reflect changes in prey availability rather than noise. Prey distribution and abundance data were unavailable for our study, and this important covariate could not be included in models. © The authors 2016.","Abundance; Densities; Functional principal components analysis; Gray whales; Models; Occurrence; Seismic survey; Spatio-temporal analysis; Zero-inflated","abundance; modeling; population density; population distribution; principal component analysis; seismic survey; spatiotemporal analysis; species occurrence; whale; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Ainsworth, L.M., Routledge, R., Cao, J., Functional data analysis in ecosystem research: the decline of Oweekeno Lake sockeye salmon and Wannock River flow (2011) J Agric Biol Environ Stat, 16, pp. 282-300; Aitchison, J., On the distribution of a positive random variable having a discrete probability mass at the origin (1955) J Am Stat Assoc, 50, pp. 901-908; Aitchison, J., Brown, J.A.C., (1957) The lognormal distribution with special reference to uses in economics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bence, J.R., Analysis of short time series: correcting for autocorrelation (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 628-639; Besag, J., York, J., Mollie, A., Bayesian image restoration with two applications in spatial statistics (1991) Ann Inst Stat Math, 43, pp. 1-59; Best, P.B., Increase rates in severely depleted stocks of baleen whales (1993) ICES J Mar Sci, 50, pp. 169-186; Bröker, K.C., Gailey, G., Muir, J.E., Racca, R., Monitoring and impact mitigation during a 4D seismic survey near a population of gray whales offSakhalin Island, Russia (2015) Endang Species Res, 28, pp. 187-208; Calambokidis, J., Falcone, E.A., Quinn, T.J., Burdin, A.M., SPLASH: structure of populations, levels of abundance and status of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2008) Report to US Department of Commerce, Seattle, WA, , www.cascadiaresearch.org/SPLASH/SPLASH-contract-Report-May08.pdf, Cascadia Research, Olympia, WA (accessed 26 Mar 2013); Castellote, M., Clark, C.W., Lammers, M.O., Acoustic and behavioural changes by fin whales (Balaenoptera phy - salus) in response to shipping and airgun noise (2012) Biol Conserv, 147, pp. 115-122; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell, R.L., Jr., Baleen whales: conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Rev, 29, pp. 35-60; Compton, R., Goodwin, L., Handy, R., Abbot, V., A critical examination of worldwide guidelines for minimising the disturbance to marine mammals during seismic surveys (2008) Mar Policy, 32, pp. 255-262; Cunningham, R.B., Lindenmayer, D.B., Modeling count data of rare species: some statistical issues (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1135-1142; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Foraging patterns of gray whales in central Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada (2001) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 223, pp. 299-310; Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Clark, C.W., Frankel, A.S., A new context-based approach to assess marine mammal behavioral responses to anthropogenic sounds (2012) Conserv Biol, 26, pp. 21-28; (2012) ArcGIS software products, , ESRI, Redlands, CA; Fadeev, V.I., Benthos studies in the feeding grounds of gray whales, 2012 (2013) Western (Okhotsk-Korean) gray whale monitoring program offthe northeast coast of Sakhalin Island, 2012, 2. , https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/wgwap_13_8_wgw_research_and_monitoring_program_in_2012__sakhalin_island__russia__volu.pdf, Results and discussion, Chap 3.

Scan surveys were conducted at 7 shore stations before, during and after the seismic survey. We investigated whether gray whales shifted their distribution with respect to distance from the shoreline in response to acoustic pulses from the seismic source. To do this, we used linear mixed effects modelling that included effects of detection, space and time. Data were tested for effects of magnitude and presence/ absence of sound from seismic activity on whale distance from shore. Sound covariates were estimated over 3 temporal scales (8 h, 3 d and since the start of seismic activity) at locations 500 and 5000 m offshore each observation station. Sighting distance from shore was less in poor visibility and at earlier times of day. No significant effects of sound were identified, although data suggest that at most stations, sighting distance from shore increased slightly over the 2 wk of the seismic survey. The analysis was limited, however, by several factors that included low numbers of sightings throughout most of the study, non-availability of data on biomass of gray whale prey and sources of error that could not be accounted for in the model. Sensitivity to potential errors in sighting distance estimation was assessed using a correction factor based on known locations of vessels and gray whales when sighted. The model was refitted using distance-corrected sightings. Results were consistent with the original model.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Cumulative sound exposure; Distance correction factor; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Seismic survey; Sighting distance; Spatio-temporal analysis","environmental disturbance; human activity; seismic survey; shoreline; sound propagation; spatiotemporal analysis; whale; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Austin, M.E., Chapman, N.R., The use of tessellation in three dimensional parabolic equation modeling (2011) J Comput Acoust, 19, pp. 221-239; Barlow, J., Cetacean abundance in Hawaiian waters estimated from a summer/fall survey in 2002 (2006) Mar Mamm Sci, 22, pp. 446-464; Bröker, K.C., Gailey, G., Muir, J.E., Racca, R., Monitoring and impact mitigation during a 4D seismic survey near a population of gray whales off Sakhalin Island, Russia (2015) Endang Species Res, 28, pp. 187-208; Clark, C.W., Tyack, P., Ellison, W.T., (1999) Responses of four species of whales to sounds of SURTASS LFA sonar transmissions, , www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA361300, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, and Marine Acoustics, Arlington, VA (accessed 6 August 2013); Coyle, K.O., Bluhm, B., Konar, B., Blanchard, A., Highsmith, R.C., Amphipod prey of gray whales in the northern Bering Sea: comparison of biomass and distribution between the 1980s and 2002-2003 (2007) Deep-Sea Res II, 54, pp. 2906-2918; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Foraging patterns of gray whales in central Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada (2001) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 223, pp. 299-310; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Diet of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada (2002) Mar Mamm Sci, 18, pp. 419-437; (2010) ArcGIS software products, , ESRI, Redlands, CA; Fadeev, V.I., (2013) Benthos studies in the feeding grounds of gray whales, 2012, 2, pp. 246-311. , https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/wgwap_13_8_wgw_research_and_monitoring_program_in_2012_sakhalin_island_russia_volu.pdf, Chap 3, Western (Okhotsk Korean) gray whale monitoring program off the northeast coast of Sakhalin Island, 2012.

Seismic surveys produce underwater sound that can cause hearing injury and behavioural disturbance in marine mammals. In addition to common mitigation measures to prevent acoustic injury, mitigation measures to avoid behavioural disturbance to gray whales within the feeding area were applied. This behavioural mitigation required delineation of the feeding area; however, no clear boundary was obvious because gray whale distribution within the feeding ground varies within and across years. We estimated the feeding area's offshore boundary using a 1.0 km2 gray whale relative density surface derived from systematic and opportunistic survey data collected during June and July 2005 to 2007. We calculated a separate surface for each of the systematic and opportunistic data sets, then calibrated and merged the 2 surfaces. We evaluated 3 geostatistical kriging methods (ordinary, simple, and co-kriging) that were applied to the merged surface to estimate a smoothed surface across areas with and without survey effort. Simple kriging was most suitable due to its ability to transition over sharp gradients in whale abundance and provide reasonable predictions in data-void areas. A 95% abundance contour of the kriged surface was used as an estimate of the feeding area boundary. Our approach provided an objective and quantitative basis to delineate the feeding area boundary to support measures taken to mitigate the potential impacts of the seismic survey on the whales.","Abundance surface; Critical habitat; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding area; Gray whale; Kriging; Opportunistic surveys; Seismic survey mitigation; Systematic surveys","abundance; endangered species; feeding; kriging; mitigation; seismic survey; whale; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Durner, G.M., Using satellite radiotelemetry data to delineate and manage wildlife populations (2004) Wildl Soc Bull, 32, pp. 661-679; Barlow, J., Gerrodette, T., Forcada, J., Factors affecting perpendicular sighting distances on shipboard linetransect surveys for cetaceans (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, 3, pp. 201-212; Beyer, H.L., (2004) Hawth's analysis tools for ArcGIS, , www.spatialecology.com/htools; Borchers, D.L., Zucchini, W., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Cañadas, A., Langrock, R., Using hidden Markov models to deal with availability bias on line transect surveys (2013) Biometrics, 69, pp. 703-713; Bröker, K.C., Gailey, G., Muir, J.E., Racca, R., Monitoring and impact mitigation during a 4D seismic survey near a population of gray whales off Sakhalin Island, Russia (2015) Endang Species Res, 28, pp. 187-208; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2004) Advanced distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Cressie, N., (1993) Statistics for spatial data, revised edn, , Wiley, New York, NY; (2007) ArcGIS software products, , Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA; Fadeev, V.I., Benthos studies in the feeding grounds of gray whales 2012 (2013), pp. 246-311. , https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/wgwap13_8_wgw_research_and_monitoring_program_in_2012_sakhalin_island_russia_volu.pdf, Western (Okhotsk-Korean) gray whale monitoring program off the northeast coast of Sakhalin Island, 2012.

Prior to the execution of the seismic survey, the sound levels from the airgun array source were modelled for all seismic acquisition lines. This yielded estimated shoreward boundaries for an assumed disturbance threshold of 156 dB re 1 μPa2-s sound exposure level (SEL) that allowed an assessment of which lines would require more stringent mitigation. To enable prediction of the sound front under variable propagation conditions, a set of acoustic footprints with a realistic range of parameters was pre-computed. In the field, an acoustic monitoring network of 9 bottom-deployed stations with tethered radio buoys transmitted full waveform data to a shore-based monitoring post. The signals were processed to yield pulse levels for comparison to the model predictions. The appropriate footprint was selected on the basis of the pulse levels received during the initial minute of a seismic line and communicated to observation teams. To further ensure the sustained accuracy of the selected footprint during a line acquisition, the modelled levels were compared in real time to the measured readings as the source moved past the line of monitoring stations; they were consistently found to match the incoming received sound levels within an accepted tolerance of 3 dB. This selection approach resulted in the best available estimation of acoustic exposure even through significant temporal changes in the hydrological conditions. © The authors 2015.","Acoustics; Disturbance; Eschrichtius robustus; Seismic survey; Sound exposure; Western gray whale","acoustic emission; biomonitoring; buoy system; environmental disturbance; seismic survey; temporal analysis; whale; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Austin, M.E., Chapman, N.R., The use of tessellation in three-dimensional parabolic equation modeling (2011) J Comput Acoust, 19, pp. 221-239; Borisov, S.V., Gritsenko, A.V., Dmitrieva, E.V., Karnauhov, A.A., (2005) Acoustic studies on the north east Sakhalin Shelf.

Such a mitigation strategy requires precise estimation of the sound field for many source locations and likely entails field validation over the course of the operation to ensure that mitigation regions are accurate.

Zhirmunsky Institute of Marine Biology, Far Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok, Russian Federation","Ampelisca eschrichtii are among the most important prey of the Western North Pacific gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus. The largest and densest known populations of this amphipod occur in the gray whale's Offshore feeding area on the Northeastern Sakhalin Island Shelf. The remote location, ice cover and stormy weather at the Offshore area have prevented winter sampling. The incomplete annual sampling has confounded efforts to resolve life history and production of A. eschrichtii. Expanded comparisons of population size structure and individual reproductive development between late spring and early fall over six sampling years between 2002 and 2013 however, reveal that A. eschrichtii are gonochoristic, iteroparous, mature at body lengths greater than 15 mm and have a two-year life span. The low frequencies of brooding females, the lack of early stage juveniles, the lack of individual or population growth or biomass increases over late spring and summer, all indicate that growth and reproduction occur primarily in winter, when sampling does not occur. Distinct juvenile and adult size cohorts additionally indicate growth and juvenile production occurs in winter through spring under ice cover. Winter growth thus requires that winter detritus or primary production are critical food sources for these ampeliscid populations and yet, the Offshore area and the Eastern Sakhalin Shelf ampeliscid communities may be the most abundant and productive amphipod population in the world. These A. eschrichtii populations are unlikely to be limited by western gray whale predation. Whether benthic community structure can limit access and foraging success of western gray whales is unclear. © 2016 Demchenko et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"adolescent; adult; Amphipoda; biomass; body height; community structure; detritus; foraging; ice cover; juvenile; life history; lifespan; population growth; population size; predation; reproduction; sampling; spring; summer; weather; whale; winter; Amphipoda; animal; Cetacea; diet; feeding behavior; fertility; growth, development and aging; life cycle stage; physiology; population density; season; Amphipoda; Animals; Biomass; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Fertility; Ice Cover; Life Cycle Stages; Population Density; Seasons; Whales",,,,,,,,"Kim, S.L., Oliver, J.S., Swarming benthic crustaceans in the Bering and Chukchi seas and their relation to geographic patterns in gray whale feeding (1989) Can J Zool., 67, pp. 1531-1542; Bogoslovskaya, L.S., Gray whale (1996) Priroda, 12, pp. 42-60; Sobolevskii, E.I., Yakovlev, Y.M., Kusakin, O.G., Some data on macrobenthos composition on feeding grounds of the gray whale (Eschrichtius gibbosus Erxl., 1777) on the northeastern Sakhalin shelf (2000) Russ J Ecol., 31, pp. 126-128; Fadeev, V.I., Investigations of benthos and food resources in summer feeding areas of the Korean-Okchotsk population of the gray whale Eschrichtius robustus in 2001-2003 (2007) Response of Marine Biota to Environmental and Climatic Changes, pp. 213-231. , Vladivostok: Dalnauka; Budnikova, L.L., Blokhin, S.A., Food contents of the eastern gray whale Eschrichtius robustus Lilljeborg, 1861 in the Mechigmensky bay of the Bering Sea (2012) Russ J Mar.

Baseline acoustic environments in LSI's three zones were monitored between 2008 and 2013, in anticipation of a new road being paved that will potentially increase tourist activity to this relatively isolated location. These zones differ in levels of both gray whale usage and tourist activity. Ambient sound level distributions were computed in terms of percentiles of power spectral densities. While these distributions are consistent across years within each zone, inter-zone differences are substantial. The acoustic environment in the upper zone is dominated by snapping shrimp that display a crepuscular cycle. Snapping shrimp also affect the middle zone, but tourist boat transits contribute to noise distributions during daylight hours. The lower zone has three source contributors to its acoustic environment: snapping shrimp, boats, and croaker fish. As suggested from earlier studies, a 300 Hz noise minimum exists in both the middle and lower zones of the lagoon, but not in the upper zone. © 2015 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustics; Boats; Power spectral density; Shellfish; Spectral density; Acoustic environment; Ambient sounds; Baja california; Gray whale; Noise distribution; Snapping shrimp; Three zones; Tourist activities; Acoustic noise; acoustics; animal; bay; Decapoda (Crustacea); devices; environment; fish; Mexico; physiology; season; ship; sound; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Bays; Decapoda (Crustacea); Environment; Fishes; Mexico; Seasons; Ships; Sound; Whales",,,,,,,,"Aalbers, S.A., Drawbridge, M.A., White seabass spawning behavior and sound production (2008) T.

The Population Consequences of Disturbance model proposed a bioenergetics model to detect biologically meaningful population responses, where disturbance costs are linked to lost energy. The model assumes that changes in behavior, caused by disturbance, compromise maternal condition, reducing energy delivery to offspring, leading to reduced reproduction, increased offspring mortality, and eventually increased adult mortality. Given its coastal habits and past whaling history, gray whales' (Eschrichtius robustus) life history and ecology are better known than for many other baleen whales. However, their preference for coastal habitat increases their exposure to human disturbance. We created a female gray whale bioenergetics model to determine energy requirements for a two-year reproductive cycle and determined the consequences of lost energy under three possible disturbance scenarios. An annual energetic loss of 4% during the year in which she is pregnant, would prevent a female from successfully producing/weaning a calf. For this reason, gray whale reproduction is particularly sensitive to disturbance during pregnancy. During the year in which she is lactating, she would wean her calf at a lower mass with a 37% energetic loss. A female would lack the energy to become pregnant during a year with a 30-35% energetic loss, and female mortality would likely occur at 40-42% annual energetic loss. Our model can be used for assessing disturbance costs or other effects associated with climate change and/or anthropogenic activities and can be applied to other species with similar life histories. © 2015 Villegas-Amtmann et al.","Bayesian analysis; Cetacean; Energetic cost; Eschrichtius robustus; Lost foraging opportunity; Metabolic rate; Mysticete; Reproductive costs",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, S.S., Fedak, M.A., The energetics of sexual success of grey seals and comparison with the costs of reproduction in other pinnipeds (1987) Reproductive Energetics in Mammals, pp. 319-339. , A.

S., C. P. 23096, Mexico","The environmental conditions of the breeding and feeding grounds of the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) fluctuates at inter-annual scales in response to regional and basin climate patterns. Thus, the goals of this study were to assess if there are any relationships between summer sea ice on their feeding ground and counts of gray whale mother-calf (MC) pairs at Ojo de Liebre Lagoon (OLL); and if El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the winter distribution of gray whales MC pairs in the three primary breeding lagoons of OLL, San Ignacio Lagoon (SIL) and Santo Domingo Channel north of Bahia Magdalena (SDCh). Maximum February counts of MC pairs were compared with the length of the open-water season at the Bering Sea during the previous year. Then, an ENSO index and sea surface temperature anomalies outside the primary lagoons was compared with the maximum February counts of MC pairs at these lagoons. Results showed that maximum counts of MC pairs in OLL correlates with sea ice conditions in their feeding grounds from the previous feeding season, and this relationship can be attributed to changes in nutritive condition of females. ENSO-related variability influences distribution of MC pairs in the southern area of SDCh during the warm 1998 El Niño and cold 1999 La Niña. This supports the hypothesis that changes in the whales' distribution related to sea temperature occurs to reduce thermal-stress and optimize energy utilization for newborn whales. Although this last conclusion should be considered in view of the limited data available from all the whales' wintering locations in all the years considered. © 2015 Salvadeo et al.

We explore the relationship between prey density and gray whale foraging starting with regional scale (10 km) assessments of whale density (per square kilometer) and foraging effort as a response to regional mysid density (per cubic meter), between 2006 and 2007. In addition we measure prey density at a local scale (100 m), while following foraging whales during focal surveys. We found regional mysid density had a significant positive relationship with both gray whale density and foraging effort. We identify a threshold response to regional mysid density for both whale density and foraging effort. In 2008 the lowest average local prey density measured beside a foraging whale was 2,300 mysids/m3. This level was maintained even when regional prey density was found to be substantially lower. Similar to other baleen whales, the foraging behavior of gray whales suggests a threshold response to prey density and a complex appreciation of prey availability across fine scales. © 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Baleen whales; Foraging effort; Mysids; Optimal foraging strategy; Predator-prey behavior","coastal zone; crustacean; foraging behavior; optimum foraging theory; predator-prey interaction; prey availability; whale; British Columbia; Canada; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behaviour: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 15, pp. 227-276; Axenrot, T., Ogonowski, M., Sanstrom, A., Didrikas, T., Multifrequency discrimination of fish and mysids (2009) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66, pp. 1106-1110; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 155-166; Bluhm, B.A., Coyle, K.O., Konar, B., Highsmith, R., High gray whale relative abundances associated with an oceanographic front in the south-central Chukchi Sea (2007) Deep-Sea Research Part II, 54, pp. 2919-2933; Buskey, E.J., Energetic cost of position-holding behaviour in the planktonic mysid Mysidium columbiae (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 172, pp. 139-147; Calambokidis, J., Darling, J.D., Deeke, V., Abundance, range and movements of a feeding aggregation of gray whales (Eschrictius robustus) from California to southeastern Alaska in 1998 (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 267-276; Calambokidis, J., Laake, J.L., Klimek, A., Abundance and population structure of seasonal gray whales in the Pacific Northwest, 1998-2008 (2010) IWC Working Paper SC/62/BRG32; Caldwell, T.J., Wilhelm, F.M., The life history characteristics, growth and density of Mysis diluviana in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, USA (2012) Journal of Great Lakes Research, 38, pp. 58-67; Charnov, E.L., Optimal foraging, the marginal value theorem (1976) Theoretical Population Biology, 9, pp. 129-136; Clutter, R.I., The microdistribution and social behaviour of some pelagic mysid shrimps (1969) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 3, pp. 125-155; Cowie, R.J., Krebs, J.R., Optimal foraging in patchy environments (1979) Population dynamics, pp. 183-205. , Pages - in B.

From north to south the number of mitotypes decreased dramatically, but mitotypes which were predominant in the south were the same as ones also abundant in northern samples. For the control region sequences only, our data and data presented in the literature suggest that breeding areas in Baja California may include diversity of both distant groups of mitochondrial lineages known for the species. On the other hand, the same control region sequences may be found in different mitochondrial genomes, and so conclusions based on this mtDNA fragment only may be incorrect. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Flores, S.R., Nigenda, S., Mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variation across calving lagoons in eastern north pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) (2009) J.

The recovery of an extremely fresh head of a neonatal female gray whale provided an opportunity to conduct the first in-depth investigation of the musculoskeletal features of the tongue and hyoid apparatus. Unlike other mysticetes, the gray whale tongue is strong, muscular, and freely mobile inside the buccal cavity. In particular, the genioglossus and hyoglossus muscles are extremely large and robust making up the majority of the body of the tongue. In addition, the genioglossus had a unique position and fiber orientation in the tongue compared to other mammals. The structure of the hyoid apparatus differs between E. robustus and other mysticete species, although there are similarities among individual elements. We provide the first documentation of fungiform papillae that may be associated with taste buds in Mysticeti. The highly mobile, robust tongue and the presence of well-defined tongue and hyoid musculature are in keeping with observations of gray whale feeding that suggest this group of whales utilize oral suction to draw benthic prey into the buccal cavity.

This specimen, a tympanic bulla and posterior process, is identical in morphology to extant Eschrichtius robustus and differs from Pliocene Eschrichtius sp. From the western North Pacific (Japan). Thus, it suggests that the modern bulla morphology of the gray whale had been acquired by the Early Pleistocene. The absence of fossil Eschrichtius in the Pliocene of the eastern North Pacific may indicate that the extant gray whale lineage originated in the western North Pacific during the Pliocene before invading the eastern North Pacific during the Early Pleistocene.

Vascular bundles of lingual retia are described within the base of the tongue of a neonatal female gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). Each rete consists of a central artery surrounded by four to six smaller veins. The retia and constituent vessels decrease in diameter as they extend anteriorly within the hyoglossus muscle from a position anterior to the basihyal cartilage toward the apex of the tongue. The position of the retia embedded in the hyoglossus and the anterior constriction of the vessels differs from reports of similar vascular bundles that were previously identified in gray whales. The retia likely serve as a counter-current heat exchange system to control body temperature during feeding. Cold blood flowing toward the body center within the periarterial veins would accept heat from warm blood in the central artery flowing toward the anterior end of the tongue. Although thermoregulatory systems have been identified within the mouths of a few mysticete species, the distribution of such vascular structures likely is more widespread among baleen whales than has previously been described.

Extant mysticetes are edentulous in adulthood, but rudimentary teeth develop in utero within open maxillary and mandibular alveolar grooves. The teeth are resorbed prenatally and the alveolar grooves close as baleen germ develops. Arteries supplying blood to highly vascularized epithelial tissue from which baleen develops pass through lateral nutrient foramina in the area of the embryonic alveolar grooves and rudimentary teeth. Those vessels are hypothesized to be branches of the superior alveolar artery, but branches of the greater palatine arteries may play a role in the baleen vascularization. Through a combination of latex injection, CT, and traditional dissection of the palate of a neonatal gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we confirm that the baleen receives blood from vessels within the superior alveolar canal via the lateral foramina. The greater palatine artery is restricted to its own passage with no connections to the baleen. This study has implications for the presence of baleen in extinct taxa by identifying the vessels and bony canals that supply blood to the epithelium from which baleen develops. The results indicate that the lateral foramina in edentulous mysticete fossils are bony correlates for the presence of baleen, and the results can be used to help identify bony canals and foramina that have been used to reconstruct baleen in extinct mysticetes that retained teeth in adulthood. Further comparisons are made with mammals that also possess oral keratin structures, including ruminants, ornithorhynchid monotremes, and sirenians.

The structure and function of baleen varies among extant mysticete clades and this variation likely can be viewed as adaptations related to different filter feeding strategies. In one of the first morphometric studies of the full baleen apparatus, we describe the morphology of complete baleen racks in neonate, yearling and adult gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), and note morphometric variations between age groups as well as within individual racks. Morphometric data and detailed descriptions were collected from the full baleen apparatus of three frozen specimens of E. robustus using previously derived ecologically significant and broad scale measurements of baleen. Additionally, characters of the baleen apparatus were described based on visible patterns of baleen laminae and plates on the dorsal root of the rack. Results indicate that the longest, widest, and thickest plates and laminae are found toward the posterior half of the rack, resulting in the greatest surface area for filtration of prey occurring in this region. Ontogenetic changes were also documented that reveal a progressive increase in the filter surface area of the developing baleen apparatus as baleen laminae and main plates grow in length and width. Also noted was a progressive posterior shift in the position of greatest filtration area. Histological examination of the epithelial base (Zwischensubstanz) and laminae showed basic epidermal layers, as well as gapping between layers and vacuoles.

Members of the right whale/bowhead whale clade (Balaenidae) are known to possess a synovial lower jaw joint, while members of the rorqual clade (Balaenopteridae) have a nonsynovial temporomandibular joint characterized by a highly flexible fibrocartilaginous pad and no joint capsule. In contrast, the gray whale possesses a modified temporomandibular joint (intermediate condition), with a vestigial joint cavity lacking a fibrous capsule, synovial membrane, and articular disk. In addition, the presence of a rudimentary fibrocartilaginous pad appears to be homologous to that seen in balaenopterid mysticetes. The intrinsic temporomandibular musculature in the gray whale was found to include a multibellied superficial masseter and a single-bellied deep masseter. The digastric and internal pterygoid muscles in E. robustus are enlarged relative to the condition documented in species of Balaenoptera. A relatively complex insertion of the temporalis muscle on the dentary is documented in the gray whale and the low, knob-like process on the gray whale dentary is determined to be homologous with the prominent coronoid process of rorquals. Comparison with the anatomy of the temporomandibular musculature in rorquals reveals an increased importance of alpha rotation of the dentary in the gray whale. This difference in muscular morphology and lines of muscle action is interpreted as representing adaptations for suction feeding.

In Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, a dozen or so species have been identified, with four occurring consistently in samples: Holmesimysis sculpta (W. Tattersall, 1933), Neomysis rayii (Murdoch, 1885), Telacanthomysis columbiae (W. Tattersall, 1933) (Fukuoka & Murano, 2001) and Columbiaemysis ignota Holmquist 1982. In this article growth and reproduction of these species over a 24-month period (May 2010-April 2012) is described, showing recovery from annual removal by the eastern Pacific grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus (Lilljeborg, 1861)) over winter, when pressure from this main predator has been relieved. Holmesimysis sculpta dominates the species flock by employing different life history strategies. It is less seasonal than sister species, overcoming a presumed resource limitation scenario and exhibits year-round reproduction, thereby demonstrating more rapid population rebound following predation and, therefore, retain dominance. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.",,"coastal water; crustacean; dominance; growth rate; life history trait; marine environment; reproduction; reproductive strategy; species flock; whale; British Columbia; Canada; Clayoquot Sound; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Vancouver Island; Acanthomysis sculpta; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida; Neomysis rayii; Peracarida",,,,,,,,"Astthorsson, O.S., Ralph, R., Growth and moulting of neomysis integer (crustacea: Mysidacea) (1984) Mar.

Dissection of the head of a neonatal gray whale revealed novel anatomical details of the eye, blowhole, incisive papilla with associated nasopalatine ducts, sensory hairs, and throat grooves. Compared to a similar sized right whale calf, the gray whale eyeball is nearly twice as long. The nasal cartilages of the gray whale, located between the blowholes, differ from the bowhead in having accessory cartilages. A small, fleshy incisive papilla bordered by two blind nasopalatine pits near the palate's rostral tip, previously undescribed in gray whales, may be associated with the vomeronasal organ, although histological evidence is needed for definitive identification. Less well known among mysticetes are the numerous elongated, stiff sensory hairs (vibrissae) observed on the gray whale rostrum from the ventral tip to the blowhole and on the mandible. These hairs are concentrated on the chin, and those on the lower jaw are arranged in a V-shaped pattern. We confirm the presence of two primary, anteriorly converging throat grooves, confined to the throat region similar to those of ziphiid and physeteroid odontocetes. A third, shorter groove occurs lateral to the left primary groove. The throat grooves in the gray whale have been implicated in gular expansion during suction feeding.

To minimize disruptions to the whales' feeding activity and enhance understanding of the potential impacts of seismic surveys on gray whales Eschrichtius robustus, an extensive monitoring and mitigation plan (MMP) was developed. Typically, mitigation plans involve observers on seismic vessels to monitor for the presence of marine mammals in an exclusion zone so as to prevent physical injury to the animals. Due to the protected status of western gray whales, an additional protection zone based on a behavioural disturbance threshold of exposure of 156 dB re μPa2-s per pulse was applied for whales within their feeding habitat defined by the estimated 95% abundance contour. Real-time radio-transmitting acoustic recorders were deployed along this contour to verify modelled acoustic footprints within the feeding grounds. Shore- and vessel-based observation teams monitored for the presence and activity of whales. A real-time GIS workflow tracking procedure was developed that integrated acoustic and whale positioning data to determine if sound levels at a whales' position within the feeding area exceeded the behavioural threshold, in which case a shut-down of the seismic source was implemented. Additionally, behaviour and distribution surveys were conducted before, during and after the seismic survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the MMP. No large changes in whale movement, respiration, or distribution patterns were observed during the seismic survey. This could be interpreted to mean that the MMP was effective in reducing the sound exposure and behavioural responses of gray whales to seismic sounds. © The authors 2015.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Eschrichtius robustus; Mitigation; Piltun; Sakhalin; Sea of Okhotsk; Seismic; Western gray whale","anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; disturbance; ecological impact; feeding ground; monitoring; seismic survey; species conservation; whale; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Sea of Okhotsk; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Krasnaya Kniga Rossiiskoi Federatsii (2001) Institute of Ecology and Evolution, 6. , www.biodat.ru/db/rb/index.htm, Russian Red Data Book Animals) A.

Previous assessments (1967-2007) have estimated detection probability (p) from the detection-non detection of pods by two independent observers. However, tracking distinct pods in the field can be difficult for single observers; resulting in biased estimates of pod sizes that needed correcting, and matching observations of the same pod by both observers involved key assumptions. Due to these limitations, a new observation approach has been adopted wherein a paired team of observers work together and use a computerised mapping application to better track and enumerate distinct pods and tally the number of whales passing during watch periods. This approach has produced consistent counts over four recently monitored migrations (2006/7, 2007/8, 2009/10 and 2010/11), with an apparent increase in p compared to the previous method. To evaluate p and estimate abundance in these four years, counts from two independent stations of paired observers operating simultaneously were compared using a hierarchical Bayesian 'N-mixture' model to jointly estimate p and abundance without the challenge of matching pods between stations. The baseline detectability powas estimated as 0.80 (95% Highest Posterior Density Interval [HPDI] = 0.75-0.85), which varied with observation conditions, observer effects and changes in whale abundance during the migration. Abundance changes were described using Bayesian model selection between a parametric model for a normally distributed common migration trend and a semi-parametric model that estimated the time trends independently for each year; the resultant migration curve was a weighted compromise between models, allowing for key departures from the common trend. The summed estimates of migration abundance ranged from 17,820 (95% HPDI = 16,150-19,920) in 2007/08 to 21,210 (95% HPDI = 19,420-23,230) in 2009/10, consistent with previous estimates and indicative of a stable population.","Abundance estimate; Gray whale; Migration; Modelling; Northern hemisphere; Pacific ocean; Survey - shore based","abundance estimation; Bayesian analysis; migration; migratory behavior; Northern Hemisphere; probability; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Brooks, S.P., Gelman, A., General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations (1998) J.

Biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) profiling is a relatively new field of research, in which the chemical composition of breath is used to non-invasively assess the health and physiological processes on-going within an animal or human. In this study, two telescopic sampling poles were designed and tested with the primary aim of collecting whale breath exhalations (WBEs). Once the WBEs were successfully collected, they were immediately transferred onto a stable matrix sorbent through a custom manifold system. A total of two large volume WBEs were successfully captured and pre-concentrated onto two Tenax®-TA traps (one exhalation per trap). The samples were then returned to the laboratory where they were analyzed using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A total of 70 chemicals were identified (58 positively identified) in the whale breath samples. These chemicals were also matched against a database of VOCs found in humans, and 44% of chemicals found in the whale breath are also released by healthy humans. The exhaled gray whale breath showed a rich diversity of chemicals, indicating the analysis of whale breath exhalations is a promising new field of research. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Breath analysis; Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS); Gray whale; Marine mammal; Volatile organic compound (VOC)","alcohol derivative; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic compound; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzothiazole; halogenated hydrocarbon; polycyclic hydrocarbon; terpene; volatile organic compound; Article; breath analysis; Cetacea; chemical analysis; data analysis; desorption; Eschrichtius robustus; exhalation; field sampling; marine mammal; mass fragmentography; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; sampling; signal noise ratio; solid phase microextraction; whale",,"benzothiazole, 95-16-9",,,,,,"Amann, A., Poupart, G., Telser, S., Ledochowski, M., Schmid, A., Mechtcheriakov, S., Applications of breath gas analysis in medicine (2004) Int.

The objectives were to determine southbound migration timing and width of the migration corridor during three seasons (2003-2006). Migration timing was determined by fitting a generalized additive model to the shore counts for each season and estimating the 10, 50, and 90 percentiles of the fitted curves. To estimate abundance from shore-based counts, a probability density function for the shore based distances was estimated by a product of a gamma distribution fit to the boat survey distance data for 2006/2007 and a half-normal detection function using combined data of the three seasons. The parameters of the gamma distribution were corrected to account for less boat survey effort carried out 20-40 km than 0-20 km from shore. The onset of the migration off Ensenada was in late December/early January and ended around 13 February. The median date was 23-26 January for the first and third season and a week early for the second season. Boat surveys indicated a wide (20 km) migration corridor but most gray whales traveled within 9.9 km from shore. The estimated total number of whales during watch hours was 2,298 (95% CI = 1,536-4,447). © 2013 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Distance; Eastern Pacific gray whale; Eschrichtius robustus; Mexico; Migration","abundance; biological survey; data set; migration; probability density function; seasonality; whale; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; Ensenada; Mexico [North America]; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Buckland, S.T., Breiwick, J.M., Cattanach, K.L., Laake, J.L., Estimated population size of the California gray whale (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 235-249; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling: Estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K; Cipriano, F., (1990) User's manual T-TRAK version 1.0.

Both specimens preserve the posterior portion of the skull from the occipital condyles to the broken frontals; the earbones are missing. A key diagnostic feature of eschrichtiids, paired tuberosities on the supraoccipital, occurs in both specimens. Because of incompleteness and differences with the living gray whale, the fossils are designated as Eschrichtius sp. rather than Eschrichtius robustus. This report of fossil gray whales is the first from Taiwan.

We used both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 12 microsatellite markers to assess whether stock structure exists among feeding grounds used by ENP gray whales. Significant mtDNA differentiation was found when samples representing the PCFG (n = 71) were compared with samples (n = 103) collected from animals feeding further north (FST = 0.012, P = 0.0045). No significant nuclear differences were detected. These results indicate that matrilineal fidelity plays a role in creating structure among feeding grounds but suggests that individuals from different feeding areas may interbreed. Haplotype diversities were similar between strata (hPCFG = 0.945, hNorthern = 0.952), which, in combination with the low level of mtDNA differentiation identified, suggested that some immigration into the PCFG could be occurring. These results are important in evaluating the management of ENP gray whales, especially in light of the Makah Tribe's proposal to resume whaling in an area of the Washington coast utilized by both PCFG and migrating whales. © 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Demographic independence; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Microsatellites; Mitochondrial DNA; Population structure","feeding ground; genetic marker; genetic structure; immigration; mitochondrial DNA; population structure; stock assessment; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; California; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); United States; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Bandelt, H.-J., Forster, P., Röhl, A., Median-joining networks for inferring intraspecific phylogenies (1999) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 16, pp. 37-48; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Brownstein, M.J., Carpten, J.D., Smith, J.R., Modulation of nontemplated nucleotide addition by Taq DNA polymerase: Primer modifications that facilitate genotyping (1996) Biotechniques, 20, pp. 1004-1010; Calambokidis, J., Darling, J.D., Deecke, V., Abundance, range and movements of a feeding aggregation of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) from California to southeastern Alaska in 1998 (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 267-276; Calambokidis, J., Laake, J.L., Klimek, A., Updated analysis of abundance and population structure of seasonal gray whales in the Pacific Northwest, 1998-2010 (2012), http://www.iwcoffice.co.uk/_documents/sci_com/workshops/AWMP3/SC_M12_AWMP2-Rev.pdf, Paper SC/M12/AWMP2 presented to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee; Carretta, J.V., Oleson, E., Weller, D.W., (2013) U.

These projects are located in proximity to a habitat used by the Korean-Okhotsk or Western North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), hereafter referred to as the Western Gray Whale (WGW). The WGW population is listed as endangered in the Russian Red Book and as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Recognizing the sensitivity of the population, a joint industry program was initiated to focus on protection and conservation through research, monitoring, and mitigation. The program has resulted in one of the most comprehensive datasets on marine mammal ecology and anthropogenic impacts at both the Individual and population levels. The dataset led to the development and implementation of mitigation plans to address major risks to the population and, through a recent tagging and satellite-monitored telemetry effort, provided important insights into Pacific basin-scale movements of the population. In addition, International collaborations with leading research institutions have been established to analyze genetic, hormone and isotope data from tissue samples and to validate acoustic disturbance and impact models at the population level. Results from these studies will be used to further reduce risks to the population, and can be applied to other sensitive Arctic regions and species. The presentation provides (1) An overview of initial studies and protection plans to address WGW ecological data gaps and risks to the population; (2) Summary results of the joint monitoring program, (3) Results from a tagging and satellitemonitored telemetry project to better assess the risks to the WGW population across its annual life cycle, and (4) A description of cutting-edge research and modeling efforts to address impacts created by both acute and chronic disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Buchan D.","","Energy Institute","21st World Petroleum Congress 2014: Responsibly Energising a Growing World, WPC 2014","15 June 2014 through 19 June 2014",,118522,,9781510825673,,,"English","World Pet.

Gray whales, however, also inhabited the North Atlantic Ocean until recent historical times (~. 1600. AD), leaving open questions about their historical ecology in nearshore communities of this basin. Here we report the discovery of fossil remains from two individual gray whales recovered from underwater excavations at separate localities of JY Reef, an offshore reef situated approximately 32. kilometers (km) offshore of St. Catherine's Island, Georgia, U.S.A. Both mandibles are diagnostic to the living E. robustus. Radiometric dating of shells from JY Reef suggests an approximate age range of these two specimens between 42 and 30. thousand years before present (ka). Morphological measurements of the preserved elements indicate that both of the mandibles likely belonged to immature and possibly yearling individuals. Collectively, these findings are among the oldest occurrences of gray whales in the North Atlantic basin, and their presence at temperate latitudes provides limited support for the hypothesis that Atlantic gray whales used a southerly breeding area at the end of a migratory pathway, by analog with lagoonal breeding environments of Baja California, Mexico, for the extant California gray whales, and the breeding areas for the extant North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) off the Georgia coast today. Stronger support for this latter contention may stem from future fossil discoveries in the region, as well as ancillary lines of evidence, such as the remains of species-specific ectoparasites and/or ancient DNA (aDNA).© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Ocean; Fossil; Gray whale; Migration; Pleistocene","breeding site; fossil record; historical ecology; morphology; paleontology; Pleistocene; shell; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Georgia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Saint Catherines Island; United States",,,,,"Smithsonian Institution, SI","The authors wish to thank GRNMS-NOAA for the use of the R/V Joe Ferguson and NOAA divers C.

These occur when mammals either force prey near the surface or provide small scraps of larger prey victims. Gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus (Lilljeborg, 1861)) have been observed to provide invertebrate prey to a variety of seabird species; however, there are no published reports of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus (Gmelin, 1789)) feeding in association with gray whales. We observed Marbled Murrelets foraging within several metres of gray whales off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, feeding on epibenthic zooplankton in 2006 and 2008. Join-count statistics identified significant clustering (p = 0.1) of 258 Marbled Murrelets within 300mof 39 feeding gray whales in June of 2006, and no association between 3 gray whales and 34 Marbled Murrelets in June and July of 2008, marking a foraging association conditional on the abundance of both gray whales and their prey, but potentially significant to Marbled Murrelet survival and fecundity.","Brachyramphus marmoratus; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding association; Gray whale; Join-count statistic; Marbled Murrelet","abundance; fecundity; feeding; foraging behavior; invertebrate; prey capture; seabird; survival; whale; zooplankton; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver Island",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC",,,"Alstadt, J., Chen, D., Getis, A., (2008) Point pattern analysis version 1.0a, , http://www.nku.edu/_longa/cgi-bin/cgi-tcl-examples/generic/ppa/ppa.cgi, Available from [accessed 19 October 2008]; Anderson, E.M., Lovvorn, J.R., Gray whales may increase feeding opportunities for avian benthivores (2008) Mar.

(CBMC), Mexico","Meiofaunal assemblages in seagrasses from Northwest Mexico were studied using NaGISA protocol. We evaluated spatiotemporal changes by sampling in the subtropical lagoon Laguna San Ignacio in December 2008 and April 2009. We took triplicate sediment core samples (10x15 cm dimensions) to quantify the abundance and taxa composition of invertebrates. We found 8 invertebrates taxa in the seagrass meadows of Zostera marina (ascidians, anomurans, amphipods, isopods, diplostraca, mollusks, ophiuroids, and polychaetes) with high spatiotemporal variability in their abundances. Mollusks, amphipods and polychaetes were the most frequent taxa observed. There were significant differences (p>0.05) between the abundances of amphipods found in the Mouth and Pitahaya zones. One of the ecological services provided by meiofaunal assemblages is that gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) that visit this lagoon in the winter season, feed on the amphipods that live within the rhizomes of Zostera marina. Seagrass meadows in Northwest Mexico provide essential ecosystem functions; they form a community on which many species rely on whether as a habitat, food source or as a fishery ground for men. The ongoing monitoring of these meadows will serve as a baseline time series from which the effect of climate change on this community will be assessed. Natural Geography in Shore Areas (NaGISA) protocol represented a good method for our biological estimations in relation to other seagrass monitoring protocols reviewed during this study. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Stations having elevated biomass were defined as those in the top three of five biomass groups defined by the Jenks criterion of natural breaks, determined as biomass ≥143.2g shell-free wet wt (ww) m-2. Elevated macrofaunal biomass was estimated to cover 4550km2 of the CBS, spreading west from Cape Bathurst. Maximum macrofaunal biomass found was 1016.0±332.2gwwm-2, of which up to 307.3±51.2gwwm-2 was due to ampeliscid amphipods of the genera Ampelisca, Byblis and Haploops. Since ampeliscids form beds where pelagic-benthic coupling is high, we use the area of elevated ampeliscid biomass (2550km2) to indicate the area of strongest upwelling effect on the benthos. Low macrofaunal biomass (&lt;50gwwm2) was observed on the shelf close to the Mackenzie River inflow and on the continental slope in the Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf. Mackenzie Trough, also where upwelling occurs, had an observed maximal biomass of 364.8±101.8gwwm-2 at its head but this was due to the polychaete Maldane sarsi and the brittle star Ophiocten sericeum rather than ampeliscid amphipods. We suggest that the ampeliscid bed under the Cape Bathurst upwelling region could be a resource for summer visiting Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), which intensively forage on ampeliscid beds elsewhere. © 2013.","Ampeliscid; Beaufort; Benthic; Biomass; Macrofauna","Ampeliscid; Beaufort; Benthic; Biomass distribution; Continental slope; Macrofauna; Pelagic-benthic coupling; Upwelling region; Electric circuit breakers; Biomass; benthos; biomass; continental slope; coupling; forage; polychaete; river; shelf break; trough; upwelling; Amundsen Gulf; Arctic Ocean; Bathurst [New Brunswick]; Beaufort Sea; Beaufort Shelf; Canada; Mackenzie River [Northwest Territories]; Mackenzie Trough; New Brunswick; Northwest Territories; Ampelisca; Ampeliscidae; Amphipoda; Byblis; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Haploops; Maldane sarsi; Ophiocten sericeum; Ophiuroidea; Polychaeta",,,,,"British Geological Survey, BGS

This area has experienced pronounced reduction in the extent of summer sea ice over the last decade, as well as increased anthropogenic activity, particularly in the form of oil and gas exploration. The effects of these changes on marine mammal species are presently unknown. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders were deployed over a wide area of the northeastern Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska from Cape Lisburne to Barrow, at distances from 8. km to 200. km from shore: up to 44 each summer and up to 8 each winter. Acoustic data were acquired at 16. kHz continuously during summer and on a duty cycle of 40 or 48. min within each 4-h period during winter. Recordings were analyzed manually and using automated detection and classification systems to identify calls.Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whale calls were detected primarily from April through June and from September to December during their migrations between the Bering and Beaufort seas. Summer detections were rare and usually concentrated off Wainwright and Barrow, Alaska. Gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale calls were detected between July and October, their occurrence decreasing with increasing distance from shore. Fin (Balaenoptera physalus), killer (Orcinus orca), minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales were detected sporadically in summer and early fall. Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) was the most commonly detected species between June and October, primarily occupying the southern edge of Hanna Shoal and haul-outs near coastal recording stations off Wainwright and Point Lay. Ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals occur year-round in the Chukchi Sea. Ringed seal acoustic detections occurred throughout the year but detection numbers were low, likely due to low vocalization rates. Bearded seal acoustic detections peaked in April and May during their breeding season, with much lower detection numbers in July and August, likely as a result of reduced calling rates after breeding season. Ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata) were only detected in the fall as they migrated south through the study area toward the Bering Sea. These results suggest a regular presence of marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea year-round, with species-dependent seasonal and spatial density variations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic detection; Arctic; Marine mammal; Vocalization","acoustics; anthropogenic effect; breeding season; classification; marine mammal; migration; sea ice; species diversity; vocalization; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Histriophoca fasciata; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus; Orcinus orca; Phoca fasciata; Phoca hispida; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,,"Aerts, L., McFarland, A.E., Watts, B.H., Lomac-MacNair, K.S., Seiser, P.E., Wisdom, S.S., Kirk, A.V., Schudel, C.A., (2013), Marine mammal distribution and abundance in three areas of the offshore northeatern Chukchi Sea during the open-water season.

The number of whales arriving to the lagoons fluctuates yearly and is related to climate variability. We analyzed the documented climate effects on the whales over their distribution range and discuss the potential effects of global climate warming in their breeding areas. Our analysis indicates that global warming will be favorable for gray whale populations, but unfavorable for the Mexican whale-watching industry: favorable, because fluctuations in calf production have been positively correlated with the length of time that the primary feeding habitat was free of seasonal ice during the previous year. However, if gray whales change their breeding areas to northern bays, they will be exposed to new challenges, which will have repercussions on the whale-watching industry. We discuss these new challenges.","Baja California; Breeding areas; Eschrichtius robustus; Global warming; Seasonal migration; Sustainable management",,,,,,,,,"Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., Kovacs, K.M., Marine mammals evolutionary biology (2006), San Diego: Academic Press; Cárdenas-Hinojosa, G., Análisis histórico de la mortalidad de ballena gris (Eschrichtius robustus) en la costa occidental de la Península de Baja California, México (2004), BSc thesis, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur; Dedina, S., Young, E., Conservation and development in the gray whale lagoons of Baja Califoronia Sur, México (1995), U.S. Marine Mammal Comissión Report.

It is generally believed that the whales closely follow the western, outer coastline of Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands), an archipelago lying between Vancouver Island and southeastern Alaska, consistent with their pattern of migrating close to shore over the majority of their northward migratory corridor. By tracking satellite-tagged individuals and surveying whales from shore bases, we provide evidence that this is not the primary migratory corridor, but instead that most whales migrate through Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance, broad waterways that lie to the east and north of Haida Gwaii. By using this route, northbound gray whales potentially face a wider range of industrial activities and developments than they would by migrating along the outer coast. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

Notably, this is the first incidental catch of gray whale in Fujian Province, as well as the first record in Chinese waters in the 21th century. This paper reports the external morphological characteristics and skeletal measurements of this whale. The whale was a female, its body length and weight were 1309 cm and 21t respectively, which is the largest gray whale stranded/by-caught in Chinese waters to date. The cranium of this gray whale was 281cm in length, 128 cm in width, and 250 kg in weight. The vertebra, phalanx, rib and V-bone of this whale were different from those reported previously. Specifically, its vertebra arrangement was C7+T13+L13+Ca23=56 and phalanx arrangement was I1, II3, III7, IV5, V3. In addition, this whale had 14 pairs of ribs and 10 V-bones. These findings indicate that the skeletons of gray whales may vary between individuals. This paper also reviews the main threats to the Western North Pacific gray whale.","External morphology; Gray whale(Eschrichtius robustus); Incidental catch; Pingtan; Skeleton","geographical distribution; morphology; new record; skeleton; whale; China; Fujian; Pingtan Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Andrew, R.C., Monograph of the Pacific cetacean.

Population estimates have been derived from these surveys using a variety of techniques that were adapted as the data collection protocol evolved. The subsequent time series of estimates was used to evaluate trend and population status, resulting in the conclusion that the population was no longer endangered and had achieved its optimum sustainable population (OSP) level. We re-evaluated the data from all of the surveys using a common estimation procedure and an improved method for treatment of error in pod size and detection probability estimation. The newly derived abundance estimates between 1967 and 1987 were generally larger (-2.5% to 21%) than previous abundance estimates. However, the opposite was the case for survey years 1992 to 2006, with estimates declining from -4.9% to -29%. This pattern is largely explained by the differences in the correction for pod size bias, which occurred because the pod sizes in the calibration data over-represented pods of two or more whales and underrepresented single whales relative to the estimated true pod size distribution.","Abundance estimate; Gray whales; Whaling - Aboriginal","abundance estimation; biological survey; data set; integrated approach; migration; size distribution; time series; whale; California; Carmel; United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Allen, B.M., Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 2008 (2009) NOAA Tech.

These projects are located in proximity to a habitat used by the Korean-Okhotsk or Western North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), hereafter referred to as the Western Gray Whale (WGW). The WGW population is listed as endangered in the Russian Red Book and as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ENL has a long history of monitoring the WGWs in partnership with Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, Ltd. (SEIC), resulting in one of the most comprehensive data sets on marine mammal ecology and anthropogenic impacts at both the individual and population levels. The robust dataset resulted in the development and implementation of mitigation plans to address major risks to the population and, through a recent tagging / satellite monitored telemetry effort, provided important insights into Pacific basin-scale movements of the population. This paper provides an overview of: 1. ENL's initial studies and protection plans to address WGW ecological data gaps and risks to the population. 2.

Thirteen gray whales were instrumented with satellite transmitters in September 2006 near the Chukotka Peninsula, Russia. Nine transmitters provided positions from whales for up to 81 days. The whales travelled within 5 km of the Chukotka coast for most of the period they were tracked with only occasional movements offshore. The average daily travel speeds were 23 km day -1 (range 9-53 km day -1). Four of the whales had daily average travel speeds &lt;1 km day -1 suggesting strong fidelity to the study area. The area containing 95% of the locations for individual whales during biweekly periods was on average 13,027 km 2 (range 7,097-15,896 km 2). More than 65% of all locations were in water &lt;30 m, and between 45 and 70% of biweekly kernel home ranges were located in depths between 31 and 50 m. Benthic density of amphipods within the Bering Strait at depths &lt;50 m was on average ~54 g wet wt m -2 in 2006. It is likely that the abundant benthic biomass is more than sufficient forage to support the current gray whale population. The use of satellite telemetry in this study quantifies space use and movement patterns of gray whales along the Chukotka coast and identifies key feeding areas. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Chukotka; Feeding grounds; Gray whale; Satellite tracking","foraging behavior; habitat selection; marine ecosystem; movement; radiotelemetry; satellite data; space use; whale; Bering Strait; Chukchi; Chukchi Peninsula; Russian Federation; Amphipoda; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: OPP-ARC-045454

From an initial focus on sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and right whales (Eubalaena spp.), the array of targeted whales expanded to include bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Extensive records of American whaling in the form of daily entries in whaling voyage logbooks contain a great deal of information about where and when the whalemen found whales. We plotted daily locations where the several species of whales were observed, both those caught and those sighted but not caught, on world maps to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of both American whaling activity and the whales. The patterns shown on the maps provide the basis for various inferences concerning the historical distribution of the target whales prior to and during this episode of global whaling. © 2012 Smith et al.",,"article; bowhead whale; fishing; geographic distribution; humpback whale; nonhuman; population distribution; seasonal variation; species distribution; sperm whale; animal; audiovisual equipment; demography; food industry; geography; history; human; methodology; population dynamics; season; species difference; statistics; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Animals; Demography; Fisheries; Geography; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Maps as Topic; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Species Specificity; Whales",,,,,,,,"Williams, M.J., Ausubel, J., Poiner, I., Garcia, S.M., Baker, D.J., Making marine life count: a new baseline for policy (2010) PLoS Biol, 8 (10), pp. e1000531; Jackson, B.C., Alexander, K.E., Sala, E., Shifting baselines: the past and the future of ocean fisheries (2011), Washington, Island Press; Starkey, D.J., Holm, P., Barnard, M., Oceans past: management insights from the history of marine animal populations (2008), London, Earthscan; Reeves, R.R., Smith, T.D., A taxonomy of world whaling: operations and eras (2006) Whales, Whaling and Ocean Ecosystems, pp. 82-101. , In: Estes JA, DeMaster DP, Doak DF, Williams TM, Brownell RL, editors, Berkeley, University of California Press; Tillman, M.F., Breiwick, J.M., Estimates of abundance for the western North Pacific sperm whale based upon historical whaling records (1983) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 5, pp. 257-269; Whitehead, H., Estimates of the current global population size and historical trajectory for sperm whales (2002) Mar Ecol Progr Ser, 242, pp. 295-304; Bannister, J.L., Taylor, S., Sutherland, H., Logbook records of 19th century American sperm whaling: a report on the 12 month project, 1978-79 (1981) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 821-833; Bockstoce, J.R., Botkin, D.B., The historical status and reduction of the western Arctic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) population by the pelagic whaling industry, 1848-1914 (1983) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 5, pp. 107-142; Josephson, E.A., Smith, T.D., Reeves, R.R., Historical distribution of right whales in the North Pacific (2008) Fish and Fisheries, 9, pp. 1-14; Maury, M.F., (1852) Whale chart of the world (the wind and current charts), , Series F.

Visual counts of whales determined that the numbers of single animals in the lower lagoon more than tripled over the observation period. All call types showed production peaks in the early morning and evening with minimum rates generally detected in the early afternoon. For four of the five observation days, the daily number of ""S1""-Type calls increased roughly as the square of the number of the animals in the lower lagoon during both daytime and nighttime. This relationship persisted when raw call counts were adjusted for variations in background noise level, using a simple propagation law derived from empirical measurements. The one observation day that did not fit the square-law relationship occurred during a week when the group size in the lagoon increased rapidly. These results suggest that passive acoustic monitoring does not measure gray whale group size directly but monitors the number of connections in the social network, which rises as roughly M2/2 for a group size M. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America.",,"acoustics; animal; animal behavior; article; biological model; female; information processing; instrumentation; male; Mexico; noise; physiology; population density; sex ratio; sound detection; time; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Data Collection; Female; Male; Mexico; Models, Biological; Noise; Population Density; Sex Ratio; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,,"Adi, K., Johnson, M.T., Osiejuk, T.S., Acoustic censusing using automatic vocalization classification and identity recognition (2010) J.

Animals of 12 taxonomic groups were revealed in the food boluses of whales; amphipods and polychaetes prevailed by biomass and frequency of occurrence. The average specific biomass of amphipods was 54.2-71.7% and the frequency of occurrence reached 96.3-100%; those of polychaetes were 19.5-37.2 and 85.2-100%, respectively. The comparison of the feeding of E. robustus in 2007-2009 and 1998-1999 displayed that the taxonomic composition of the eaten animals remained the same, but the sizes of the groups changed. In 2007-2009, 68 species of amphipods were recorded in the whale stomachs; the input to biomass was counted for six species, Anonyx nugax (31.7%), Ampelisca macrocephala (22.3%), Psammonyx kurilicus (15.3%), Ampelisca eschrichti (9.1%), Hippomedon denticulatus orientalis (4.3%), and Pontoporeia femorata (4.6%). As in 1998-1999, the first two species prevailed. In percentage terms, the greatest portion of the whale bolus was based on most abundant benthic species. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","amphipods; Eschrichtius robustus; food composition; frequency of occurrence; gray whale; polychaetes; specific biomass","amphipod; food consumption; polychaete; stomach content; whale; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Ampelisca eschrichti; Ampelisca macrocephala; Amphipoda; Animalia; Anonyx nugax; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Hippomedon denticulatus; Polychaeta; Pontoporeia femorata; Psammonyx",,,,,,,,"Zenkovich, B.A., Concerning Foods of California Gray Whale (1934) Rybnoye khozyaistvo Dal'nego Vostoka, (1-2), p. 112; Zenkovich, B.A., Foods of Far East Whales (1937) DAN SSSR, 16 (4), pp. 231-234; Blokhin, S.A., Pavlyuchkov, V.A., Feeding of Whales of California-Chukchi Population in the waters of Chukchi Peninsula in 1980 (1981) Nauchno-issled. raboty po morskim mlekopitayuschim severnoi chasti Tikhogo okeana v 1980-1981 gg.

These absorbance maxima values are blueshifted relative to those from typical terrestrial mammals (≈500 nm) but are redshifted when compared to those identified in the odontocetes (479-484 nm). Although these mysticete species represent two of the four mysticete families, they do not fully represent the mysticete whales in terms of foraging strategy and underwater photic environments where foraging occurs. In order to better understand the spectral sensitivities of the mysticete whale rod visual pigments, we have examined the rod opsin genes from 11 mysticete species and their associated amino acid substitutions. Based on the amino acids occurring at positions 83, 292, and 299 along with the directly determined dark spectra from expressed odontocete and mysticete rod visual pigments, we have determined that the majority of mysticete whales possess deep-sea and pelagic like rod visual pigments with absorbance maxima between 479 and 484 nm. Finally, we have defined the five amino acid substitution events that determine the resulting absorbance spectra and associated absorbance maxima for the mysticete whale rod visual pigments examined here.

Populations at low densities may offer an unobstructed view of basic environmental and physiological interactions that impact individual fitness and thus population productivity. The energy reserves of an organism are reflected in its body condition, a measure linking individual fitness and the environment. From 1997 to 2007, we monitored the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population on its primary summer feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia. This effort resulted in a large data set of photo-identification images from 5,007 sightings of 168 individual whales that we used to visually assess western gray whale body condition. We quantified temporal variation in the resulting 1,539 monthly body condition determinations with respect to observations of reproductive status and sex. Western gray whale body condition varied annually, and we identified years of significantly better (2004) and worse (1999, 2006, and 2007) body condition. This study is the 1st to track the within-season body condition of individual whales. Body condition improved significantly as the summer progressed, although results suggest that not all whales replenish their energy stores by the end of the season. The body condition of lactating females was significantly worse than that of other whales at all times and was most often determined to be compromised. The body condition of their weaning calves exhibited no temporal variation and was consistently good. It is possible lactating females provide an energetic buffer to their offspring at the expense of their own body condition and future reproductive success. Findings from the analysis establish a foundation for quantifying links between western gray whale body condition, demographic parameters, and environmental conditions; and provide a baseline for monitoring individual and population condition of an ecosystem sentinel species in a changing environment. Overall, this study highlights the presence of density-independent environmental and physiological mechanisms that affect the abundance and growth of populations. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.","density-independence; energy reserves; environmental variability; fitness; Okhotsk Sea; ordinal logistic regression; photo-identification; western gray whales","abundance; bioenergetics; body condition; data set; demography; density dependence; endangered species; environmental conditions; feeding ground; fitness; image analysis; lactation; physiology; population growth; reproductive success; temporal variation; weaning; whale; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Sea of Okhotsk; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data Analysis, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Mez-Campos, E.G.O., (2007) The Reliability of Blubber Thickness As A Measure of Body Condition in Large Whales, , Paper SC/59/O17 presented to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee, June 2007, Anchorage, Alaska; Angell, C.M., (2006) Body Fat Condition of Free-ranging Right Whales, Eubalaena Glacialis and Eubalaena Australis, , Ph.D. dissertation, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; Atkinson, S.N., Ramsay, M.A., The effects of prolonged fasting on the body composition and reproductive success of female polar bears (1995) Functional Ecology, 9 (4), pp. 559-567; Batzli, G.O., Esseks, E., Body fat as an indicator of nutritional condition for the brown lemming (1992) Journal of Mammalogy, 73 (2), pp. 431-439; Belonje, P.C., Van Niekerk, C.H., A review of the influence of nutrition upon the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy in the mare (1975) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 23, pp. 167-169; Bernardo, J., Maternal effects in animal ecology (1996) American Zoologist, 36 (2), pp. 83-105; Berryman, A.A., Limiting factors and population regulation (2004) Oikos, 105 (3), pp. 667-670. , DOI 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13381.x; Blokhin, S.A., Terms of grey whales' (Eschrichtius robustus) appearance near the northeastern Sakhalin, their abundance and behavior in the beginning and in the end of their stay in the area of Piltun Bay (2004) Marine Mammals of the Holarctic, Collection of Scientific Papers, pp. 78-82. , (V M.

As with many new entertainment ‘industries’ of our era ranging from surfing to the iPods, iPhones and iPads of Apple Computer, Inc., it all started in California. The surprise perhaps lies in how popular and pervasive worldwide the whale-watching industry has become – to the extent that we now focus on the implications from ‘too much success’, try to limit the industry in some areas, and ask if true sustainability is achievable. The origins and early historical development of the whale-watching industry have shaped the industry to this day. Considering the developmental stages of tourism and rate of growth experienced by the whale-watch industry helps us understand its impact. Whale-watching has been profoundly influenced by a number of factors: (1) the platform used, including the types of boats, as well as the background and location of the whale-watching owner-operators; (2) the species being watched and the peculiar geography of the ecosystem where they are found; and (3) the typology of the visitors or tourists taking the trips and their expectations. Looking at all these aspects helps us grasp what the industry has become today and the implications for the future. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,,,,"Beasley, I., Bejder, L., Marsh, H., (2010) Dolphin-Watching Tourism in the Mekong River, Cambodia: A Case Study of Economic Interests Influencing Conservation, , Paper presented to the Scientific Committee at the 62nd Meeting of the InternationalWhaling Commission, 30May–11 June 2010, Agadir, Morocco.

As part of a long-term study on whales off Sakhalin Island, Russia, photo-catalog comparisons of gray whales in the western and eastern North Pacific (ENP) were undertaken to assess population mixing. These comparisons in -volved 2 ap proaches: (1) a systematic comparison of the WNP 'Sakhalin Catalog' to an ENP 'Pacific Northwest Catalog' that consisted of images from the northwest coast of North America and (2) a non-systematic comparison of the WNP 'Sakhalin Catalog' to an ENP 'Laguna San Ignacio Catalog' that consisted of images from central Baja California, Mexico. The Sakhalin to Pacific Northwest comparison consisted of 181 and 1064 whales, respectively, and resulted in 6 matches (3 males, 2 females, and 1 whale of unknown sex). All sightings of 'Sakhalin whales' in the Pacific Northwest occurred off southern Vancouver Island, British Co -lum bia, Canada. The Sakhalin to Laguna San Ignacio comparison consisted of 181 and 2514 whales, respectively, and re sulted in 4 matches (2 males and 2 fe -males). As the Pacific Northwest and Laguna San Ignacio catalogs represent only a small fraction of the total estimated number of individuals in the ENP population (~19 000), it is likely that more WNP/ENP ex change has occurred than was detected by these photo-catalog comparisons. Although these matches provide new records of movements between the WNP and ENP, recent observations of gray whales off Japan and China suggest that not all gray whales identified in the WNP share a common wintering ground. © Inter-Research 2012.","Conservation; Gray whale; Movement patterns; Pacific ocean","conservation management; endangered species; movement; population distribution; whale; Baja California Sur; British Columbia; Canada; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Northwest; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; San Ignacio Lagoon; Vancouver Island",,,,,,,,"Bradford, A.L., (2011) Population characteristics of the critically endangered western gray whale, , PhD dissertation.

We studied the association of Marbled Murrelets with foraging Gray Whales along a 105 km transect on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, in June 2005. Gray Whales forage on benthic invertebrates by scooping up bottom sediments. Spatial association was analyzed across the extent of the transect and within a 50 m radius of surfacing whales. At both spatial scales, murrelets were more closely associated with Gray Whales than would be expected by chance. Murrelets were observed feeding in direct association with foraging whales, and qualitative observations from plankton tows indicated much more abundant zooplankton near surfacing whales. More research is needed to elucidate this relationship. Identifying facilitative relationships among marine organisms is important in understanding structure of food webs and adaptability to environmental change.","Commensalism; Facilitation; Interspecific associations; Social foraging","abundance; adaptation; commensalism; environmental change; food web; foraging behavior; interspecific interaction; plankton; seabird; spatial analysis; whale; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver Island; Brachyramphus; Brachyramphus marmoratus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata",,,,,,,,"Au, D.W.K., Pitman, R.L., Seabird interactions with dolphins and tuna in the eastern Pacific (1986) Condor, 88, pp. 304-317; Becker, B.H., Beisinger, S.R., Centennial decline in the trophic level of an endangered seabird after fisheries decline (2005) Conservation Biology, 20, pp. 470-479; Bruno, J.F., Stachowicz, J.J., Bertness, M.D., Inclusion of facilitation into ecological theory (2002) Trends In Ecology and Evolution, 18, pp. 119-125; Burger, A.E., Chatwin, T.A., (2002) Multi-scale Studies of Populations, Distribution, and Habitat Associations of Marbled Murrelets In Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, , Victoria, BC: Ministry of Water, Land, and Air Protection; Burger, A.E., Hitchcock, C.L., Davoren, G.K., Spatial aggregations of seabirds and their prey on the continental shelf off SW Vancouver Island (2004) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 283, pp. 279-292; Burket, E.E., Marbled Murrelet food habits and prey ecology (1995) Ecology and Conservation of the Marbled Murrelet, pp. 223-246. , Ralph, C.J., Hunt Jr., G.L., Raphael, M.G. & Piatt, J.F.

We evaluate trends in the community structure of mysids (species dominance, diversity, and richness) across mysid habitat in the study area during the gray whale foraging season (May-September) for the period 1996 and 2008. Mysid species composition varies among years and diversity has increased as whales shifted their predatory focus from benthic amphipods (Ampeliscidae Costa, 1857) to mysids, near our starting point in 1996. Holmesimysis sculpta Tattersall, 1933 was the dominant species in early years; however, in 2007, the dominance shifted to Neomysis rayi Murdoch, 1885. The habitat restrictions and life history attributes of local populations of coastal mysids leave them vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of increased predation pressure by gray whales. This case study presents a unique examination implicating predation as an agent of disturbance capable of altering the species structure of a local prey community. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Gray whales; Intermediate disturbance; Mysids; Species diversity; Top-down control","coexistence; crustacean; disturbance; dominance; foraging behavior; predator-prey interaction; species diversity; species richness; top-down control; vulnerability; whale; zooplankton; Acanthomysis sculpta; Ampeliscidae; Amphipoda; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida; Mysidae; Neomysis",,,,,"University of Victoria, UVic","Acknowledgments Research was conducted in the traditional territory of the Ahousaht First Nation.

In particular, the Makah are pursuing legal permission to resume their hunt. Although the majority of whales in this population migrate to summer feeding grounds in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, a small number of individuals (~200) spend the summers feeding in the waters ranging from northern California to southeast Alaska. The relationship of these 'southern feeding group' whales to the rest of the population is unknown. This information is key to making appropriate management decisions, because these whales inhabit the waters directly adjacent to the aboriginal communities interested in resuming whaling. We compared mitochondrial sequence data from 40 southern feeding group individuals to sequences from 105 individuals representing the larger population. We found significant differences in haplotype frequencies between the 2 groups, with an estimated long-term rate of exchange between the groups being &lt;&lt;1%. Moreover, estimates of Θ (N eμ for mtDNA data, i.e. the probability of a mutation occurring within the population in each generation) were significantly different between the 2 groups, indicating that the maternal lineages of the southern feeding group represent a distinct seasonal subpopulation. Combined, these data show that the southern feeding group of gray whales qualifies as a separate management unit, which should be considered when making conservation decisions. © Inter-Research 2011.","Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Management unit; mtDNA; Population structure; Whaling","endangered species; feeding ground; indigenous population; mitochondrial DNA; nature conservation; population structure; subpopulation; whale; whaling; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Palumbi, S., Comparing evolutionary patterns and variability in the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b in three species of baleen whales (2009) J Mol Evol, 68, pp. 97-111; Alter, S.E., Rynes, E., Palumbi, S.R., DNA evidence for historic population size and past ecosystem impacts of gray whales (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 15162-15167; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Smith, T.G., Ellis, G.M., A cetacean biopsy system using lightweight pneumatic darts, and its effect of the behavior of killer whales (1996) Mar Mamm Sci, 12, pp. 14-27; Beerli, P., Comparison of Bayesian and maximumlikelihood inference of population genetic parameters (2006) Bio informatics, 22, pp. 341-345; Beerli, P., Felsenstein, J., Maximum likelihood estimation of a migration matrix and effective population sizes in n subpopulations by using a coalescent approach (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 4563-4568; Butterworth, D.S., Korrûbel, J.L., Punt, A.E., What is needed to make a simple density-dependent response population model consistent with data for the eastern gray whales?

This paper summarizes aerial survey and photogrammetric efforts to determine body lengths and temporal and spatial distributions of migratory gray whales in the southern portion of the Southern California Bight. Aerial surveys were flown along 13 east-west transects between lat. 32°35'N and 33°30'N during the southbound gray whale migratory seasons of 1988-90 in the Southern California Bight. Photogrammetry was used to obtain body length estimates of animals during some of the surveys. A total of 1,878 whales in 675 groups were sighted along 25,440 km of transect distance flown and 217 body lengths were measured. Using position and heading data, three major migratory pathways or corridors in the southern portion of the bight are defined. Those migrating offshore were split almost evenly between two corridors along the west sides of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. These corridors converge on the mainland coast between San Diego and the United States-Mexico border. No whales larger than 11.5 m were photographed within 30 km of the mainland coast, suggesting that smaller, and presumably younger, whales use the coastal migratory corridor through the California Bight.",,"body size; data set; functional morphology; migration determinant; offshore application; photogrammetry; spatiotemporal analysis; survey; whale; California; Channel Islands [California]; Pacific Ocean; San Clemente Island; Santa Catalina Island; Southern California Bight; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Braham, H.W., Distribution and migration of gray whales in Alaska (1984) The Gray Whale, Eschrichtius Robustus, pp. 249-266. , M.

The invertebrates that form their primary prey are restricted to shallow water environments, but global sea-level changes during the Pleistocene eliminated or reduced this critical habitat multiple times. Because the fossil record of gray whales is coincident with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, gray whales survived these massive changes to their feeding habitat, but it is unclear how. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reconstructed gray whale carrying capacity fluctuations during the past 120,000 years by quantifying gray whale feeding habitat availability using bathymetric data for the North Pacific Ocean, constrained by their maximum diving depth. We calculated carrying capacity based on modern estimates of metabolic demand, prey availability, and feeding duration; we also constrained our estimates to reflect current population size and account for glaciated and non-glaciated areas in the North Pacific. Our results show that key feeding areas eliminated by sea-level lowstands were not replaced by commensurate areas. Our reconstructions show that such reductions affected carrying capacity, and harmonic means of these fluctuations do not differ dramatically from genetic estimates of carrying capacity. Conclusions/Significance: Assuming current carrying capacity estimates, Pleistocene glacial maxima may have created multiple, weak genetic bottlenecks, although the current temporal resolution of genetic datasets does not test for such signals. Our results do not, however, falsify molecular estimates of pre-whaling population size because those abundances would have been sufficient to survive the loss of major benthic feeding areas (i.e., the majority of the Bering Shelf) during glacial maxima. We propose that gray whales survived the disappearance of their primary feeding ground by employing generalist filter-feeding modes, similar to the resident gray whales found between northern Washington State and Vancouver Island.",,"article; benthos; environmental carrying capacity; environmental impact; feeding; feeding ecology; glaciation; gray whale; Pacific Ocean; Pleistocene; population size; quantitative analysis; sea level; whale; animal; feeding behavior; ice cover; physiology; population migration; time; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata; sea water; Animal Migration; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Ice Cover; Pacific Ocean; Seawater; Time Factors; Whales",,,,,,,,"Martin, P.S., Klein, R.G., (1984) Quaternary Extinctions: A Prehistoric Revolution, , Tucson, University of Arizona Press; Koch, P.L., Barnosky, A.D., Late Quaternary extinctions: state of the debate (2006) Ann Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 37, pp. 215-250; Barnosky, A.D., Koch, P.L., Feranec, R.S., Wing, S.L., Shabel, A.B., Assessing the Causes of Late Pleistocene Extinctions on the Continents (2004) Science, 306, pp. 70-75; Gill, J.L., Williams, J.W., Jackson, S.T., Lininger, K.B., Robinson, G.S., Pleistocene megafaunal collapse, novel plant communities, and enhanced fire regimes in North America (2009) Science, 326, pp. 1100-1103; Domning, D.P., Sirenian evolution in the North Pacific Ocean (1978) Univ Calif Pub Geol Sci, 118, pp. 1-176; LeBoeuf, B.J., Kenyon, K.W., Villa-Ramirez, B., The Caribbean monk seal is extinct (1986) Mar Mamm Sci, 2, pp. 70-72; Anderson, P.K., Marine mammals in the next one hundred years: twilight for a Pleistocene megafauna?

The hyoid bone and associated musculature generates rapid, piston-like retraction, and depression of the hyoid and tongue. ""Capture"" suction feeders (e.g., Globicephala) use suction for capturing and swallowing prey. ""Combination"" feeders (i.e., Lagenorhynchus) use both raptorial feeding (to capture prey) and suction (to ingest prey). In ""capture"" suction feeders, features of the hyoid and skull have been attributed to creating suction (i.e., large surface area and mandibular bluntness). In addition to odontocetes, a mysticete, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), is considered a benthic suction feeder. However, anatomical studies of purported suction-feeding structures of the gray whale are lacking. In addition, few studies have utilized evolutionary approaches to understand the history of suction feeding in cetaceans. This study incorporates quantitative and qualitative hyoid and cranial data from 35 extant and 14 extinct cetacean species into a multivariate principal component analysis and comparative phylogenetic analyses. Conclusions from these analyses are that some commonly attributed features (i.e., ventral throat grooves and mandibular bluntness) and one principal component are significantly correlated with suction feeding. Finally, ancestral state reconstructions indicate that suction feeding likely evolved once, early in cetacean evolutionary history. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Anatomy; Cetaceans; Comparative phylogenetic analyses; Eschrichtius robustus; Evolution; Gray whale; Suction feeding","anatomy; comparative study; evolutionary biology; feeding mechanism; phylogenetics; principal component analysis; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; whale; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Globicephala; Lagenorhynchus",,,,,,,,"Adam, P.J., Berta, A., Evolution of prey capture strategies and diet in the Pinnipedimorpha (Mammalia, Carnivora) (2002) Oryctos, 4, pp. 83-107; Agnarsson, I., May-Collado, L.J., The phylogeny of Cetartiodactyla: The importance of dense taxon sampling, missing data, and the remarkable promise of cytochrome b to provide reliable species-level phylogenies (2008) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 48, pp. 964-985; Barnes, L.G., The fossil record and evolutionary relationship of the genus Tursiops (1990) The bottlenose dolphin, pp. 1-28. , S.

Salient morphological features are illustrated and identified, including overall shape of the bulla, size of the conical process of the bulla, morphology of the promontorium, and the size and shape of the anterior process of the petrosal. We place our comparative osteological observations into a phylogenetic context in order to initiate an exploration into petrotympanic evolution within Mysticeti. Principal Findings: The morphology of the petrotympanic complex is diagnostic for individual species of baleen whale (e.g., sigmoid and conical processes positioned at midline of bulla in Balaenoptera musculus; confluence of fenestra cochleae and perilymphatic foramen in Eschrichtius robustus), and several mysticete clades are united by derived characteristics. Balaenids and neobalaenids share derived features of the bulla, such as a rhomboid shape and a reduced anterior lobe (swelling) in ventral aspect, and eschrichtiids share derived morphologies of the petrosal with balaenopterids, including loss of a medial promontory groove and dorsomedial elongation of the promontorium. Monophyly of Balaenoidea (Balaenidae and Neobalaenidae) and Balaenopteroidea (Balaenopteridae and Eschrichtiidae) was recovered in phylogenetic analyses utilizing data exclusively from the petrotympanic complex. Significance: This study fills a major gap in our knowledge of the complex structures of the mysticete petrotympanic complex, which is an important anatomical region for the interpretation of the evolutionary history of mammals. In addition, we introduce a novel body of phylogenetically informative characters from the ear region of mysticetes. Our detailed anatomical descriptions, illustrations, and comparisons provide valuable data for current and future studies on the phylogenetic relationships, evolution, and auditory physiology of mysticetes and other cetaceans throughout Earth's history. © 2011 Ekdale et al.",,"article; Balaenoptera; cochlea fenestra; comparative anatomy; controlled study; ear; eardrum; extant species; monophyly; nonhuman; phylogeny; species comparison; whale; animal; biological model; bone; comparative study; genetics; histology; middle ear; species extinction; whale; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Mysticeti; Neobalaenidae; Animals; Bone and Bones; Ear, Middle; Extinction, Biological; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; Whales",,,,,,,,"Kellogg, R., The history of whales- their adaptation to life in the water (1928) Q Rev Biol, 3, pp. 29-76; Luo, Z.X., Gingerich, P.D., Terrestrial Mesonychia to aquatic Cetacea: transformation of the basicranium and evolution of hearing in whales (1999) U Mich Pap Paleontol, 31, pp. 1-98; Nummela, S., Hearing in aquatic mammals (2008) Sensory Evolution on the Threshold, pp. 211-224. , In: Thewissen JGM, Nummela S, editors, Berkeley, University of California Press; Fraser, F.C., Purves, P.E., Hearing in Cetaceans (1960) B Brit Mus (Nat Hist) Zool, 7, pp. 1-140; Kasuya, T., Systematic considerations of recent toothed whales based on the morphology of tympano-petrosal bone (1973) Sci Rep Whales Inst, 25, pp. 1-103; Ketten, D.R., Cetacean ears (2000) Hearing by Whales and Dolphins, pp. 43-108. , In: Au WWL, Popper AN, Fay RR, editors, New York, Springer-Verlag; Au, W.W.L., Hearing in whales and dolphins: an overview (2000) Hearing by Whales and Dolphins, pp. 1-42. , In: Au WWL, Popper AN, Fray RR, editors, New York, Springer; Parks, S.E., Ketten, D.R., O'Malley, J.T., Arruda, J., Anatomical predictions of hearing in the North Atlantic right whale (2007) Anat Rec, 290, pp. 734-744; O'Leary, M., An anatomical and phylogenetic study of the osteology of the petrosal of extant and extinct artiodactylans (Mammalia) and relatives (2010) B Am Mus Nat Hist, 355, pp. 1-206; Luo, Z.X., Homology and transformation of cetacean ectotympanic structures (1998) The Emergence of Whales, pp. 269-302. , In: Thewissen JGM, editors, New York, Plenum Press; Geisler, J., Luo, Z.X., The petrosal and inner ear of Herpetocetus sp.

Since gray whales were last recorded in the North Atlantic in the 1700s, these sightings prompted much speculation about this whale's population origin. Here, we consider three hypotheses for the origin of this individual: (1) it represents a vagrant individual from the larger extant population of gray whales found in the eastern North Pacific; (2) it represents a vagrant individual from the smaller extant population found in the western North Pacific; or (3) it represents an individual from the previously thought extinct North Atlantic population. We believe that the first is the most likely, based on current population sizes, on known summer distributions, on the extent of cetacean monitoring in the North Atlantic and on the results of a performed route analysis. While it is difficult to draw conclusions from such singular events, the occurrence of this individual in the Mediterranean coincides with a shrinking of Arctic Sea ice due to climate change and suggests that climate change may allow gray whales to re-colonize the North Atlantic as ice and temperature barriers to mixing between northern North Atlantic and North Pacific biomes are reduced. Such mixing, if it were to become widespread, would have implications for many aspects of the marine conservation and ecology of these two regions. © 2011 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","climate change; ecosystem sentinels; global warming; migration; sea ice; vagrancy","Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Berzin, A.A., Soviet studies on the distribution and numbers of gray whale in the Bering and Chukchi Seas from 1968 to 1982 (1984) The Gray Whale, pp. 409-419. , Eschrichtius robustus Jones M.L., Swartz S.L. and Leatherwood S.

The sequence of ossification of these joints in mysticetes can be used to characterize the relative age in the calf and early juvenile ontogenetic stages. This study examined occipital joints ossification of 38 dry prepared neonate specimens in four mysticete species from two families (Eschrichtiidae: Eschrichtius robustus; Balaenopteridae: Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Balaenoptera physalus, and Megaptera novaeangliae). Each of the joints responsible for the fusion of the occiput were examined and rated for degree of ossification. The cranial ossification analysis indicates that E. robustus calves have open occipital joints until ~6 months of age and are born at a less mature stage than closely related balaenopterids.

Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observations of foraging and feeding behavior of >150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers. Attacks were conducted by groups of 3 to 4 killer whales, which attempted to drown their prey. Gray whales generally tried to move into shallow water along the shoreline when attacked; if they succeeded in reaching depths of 3 m or less, attacks were abandoned. Kills occurred in waters from 15 to 75 m deep or were moved into such areas after death. After some hours of feeding, the carcasses were usually left, but were re-visited and fed on by killer whales over several days. Carcasses or pieces of prey that floated onshore were actively consumed by brown bears Ursus arctos, and carcasses on the bottom were fed on by sleeper sharks Somniosus pacificus, apparently increasing the local density of both species. © Inter-Research 2011.","Atching Preyc; Brown bear; Foraging strategy; Hale Gray; Killer whale; Predatory behavior; Scavenger; Sleeper shark","bear; feeding behavior; marine ecosystem; predation; scavenger; whale; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Fox Islands; Unimak Island; United States; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Orcinus orca; Somniosus microcephalus; Somniosus pacificus; Ursus arctos",,,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., (2006) Killer Whales of the World: Natural History and Conservation, , Voyageur Press, St. Paul, MN; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Occurrence and behaviour of transient killer whales: Seasonal and pod-specific variability, foraging behaviour, and prey handling (1995) Can J Zool, 73, pp. 1300-1311; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Ecological and social determinants of group size in transient killer whales (1996) Behav Ecol, 7, pp. 408-416; Baldridge, A., Killer whales attack and eat a gray whale (1972) J Mammal, 53, pp. 898-900; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., (2000) Population Structure and Mating Patterns of Killer Whales (Orcinus Orca) as Revealed by DNA Analysis, , PhD thesis University of British Columbia, Vancouver; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Heise, K.A., The natural history and ecology of killer whales (2006) Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems, pp. 163-173. , Estes JA, DeMaster DP, Doak DF, Williams TM, Brownell RL Jr (eds), University of California Press, Berkeley, CA; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Ford, J.K.B., Heise, K.A., The mixed blessing of echolocation: differences in sonar use by fisheating and mammal - Eating killer whales (1996) Anim Behav, 51, pp. 553-565; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Smith, T.G., Ellis, G.M., A cetacean biopsy system using lightweight pneumatic darts, and its effect on the behavior of killer whales (1996) Mar Mamm Sci, 12, pp. 14-27; Bigg, M.A., An assessment of killer whale (Orcinus orca) stocks off Vancouver Island (1982) Rep Int Whal Comm, 32, pp. 625-666. , British Columbia; Bigg, M.A., Ellis, G.M., Ford, J.K.B., Balcomb III, K.C., (1987) Killer Whales: A Study of Their Identification, Genealogy and Natural History in British Columbia and Washington State, , Phantom Press, Nanaimo, British Columbia; Bigg, M.A., Olesiuk, P.F., Ellis, G.M., Ford, J.K.B., Balcomb III, K.C., Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State (1990) Rep Int Whal Comm Spec, (12), pp. 383-405; Brown, C., Brown bear management report of survey-inventory activities 1 July 2002-30 June 2004 (2005) Alaska Department of Fish and Game, , Juneau, AK (ed); Budylenko, G.A., Distribution and some aspect of the biology of killer whale in the South Atlantic (1981) Rep Int Whal Comm, 31, pp. 523-525; Butler, L.B., Unit 10 brown bear management report (2005) Brown Bear Management Report of Surveyinventory Activities 1 July 2002-30 June 2004.

These 'biofuel' stores have been used by humans from prehistoric times to more recent industrial- scale whaling. Deep-sea biologists have now discovered that the oily bones of dead whales on the seabed are also used by specialist and generalist scavenging communities, including many unique organisms recently described as new to science. In the context of both cetacean and deep-sea invertebrate biology, we review scientific knowledge on the oil content of bone from several of the great whale species: Balaenoptera musculus, Balaenoptera physalus, Balaenoptera borealis, Megaptera novaeangliae, Eschrichtius robustus, Physeter macrocephalus and the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba. We show that data collected by scientists over 50 years ago during the heyday of industrial whaling explain several interesting phenomena with regard to the decay of whale remains. Variations in the lipid content of bones from different parts of a whale correspond closely with recently observed differences in the taphonomy of deep-sea whale carcasses and observed biases in the frequency of whale bones at archaeological sites. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Bioerosion; Marine mammals; Osedax; Whale-fall","anthropology; archaeological evidence; biofuel; bone; deep-sea organism; lipid; oil; paleoecology; scavenger; taphonomy; whale; whaling; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Osedax; Physeter catodon; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,"Krogh, A., Conditions of life at great depths in the ocean (1934) Ecol.

From its inception at Monterey, Calif, in the mid 1850's, the shore fishery, involving open boats deployed from land to catch and tow whales for processing, eventually spread from Monterey south to San Diego and Baja California and north to Crescent City near the California-Oregon border. It had declined to a relict industry by the 1880's, although sporadic efforts continued into the early 20th century. The main target species were gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, with the valuable North Pacific right whale, Eubalaena japonica, also pursued opportunistically. Catch data are grossly incomplete for most stations; no logbooks were kept for these operations as they were for high-seas whaling voyages. Even when good information is available on catch levels, usually as number of whales landed or quantity of oil produced, it is rarely broken down by species. Therefore, we devised methods for extrapolation, interpolation, pro rationing, correction, and informed judgment to produce time series of catches. The resulting estimates of landings from 1854 to 1899 are 3,150 (SE = 112) gray whales and 1,637 (SE = 62) humpback whales. The numbers landed should be multiplied by 1.2 to account for hunting loss (i.e. whales harpooned or shot but not recovered and processed).",,"catch statistics; commercial species; time series; whale; whaling; Baja California [(PNN) Mexico]; California; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena japonica; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Rynes, E., Palumbi, S.R., The once and future gray whales: DNA evidence for historic population size and ecosystem impacts (2007) Proc.

Henderson identified three periods in the southern part of the fishery: Initial, 1846-1854; Bonanza, 1855-1865; and Declining, 1866-1874. The largest catches were made by ""lagoon whaling"" in or immediately outside the whale population's main wintering areas in Mexico-Magdalena Bay, Scammon's Lagoon, and San Ignacio Lagoon. Large catches were also made by ""coastal"" or ""alongshore"" whaling where the whalers attacked animals as they migrated along the coast. Gray whales were also hunted to a limited extent on their feeding grounds in the Bering and Chukchi Seas in summer. Using all available sources, we identified 657 visits by whaling vessels to the Mexican whaling grounds during the gray whale breeding and calving seasons between 1846 and 1874. We then estimated the total number of such visits in which the whalers engaged in gray whaling. We also read logbooks from a sample of known visits to estimate catch per visit and the rate at which struck animals were lost. This resulted in an overall estimate of 5,269 gray whales (SE = 223.4) landed by the ship-based fleet (including both American and foreign vessels) in the Mexican whaling grounds from 1846 to 1874. Our ""best"" estimate of the number of gray whales removed from the eastern North Pacific (i.e. catch plus hunting loss) lies somewhere between 6,124 and 8,021, depending on assumptions about survival of struck-but-lost whales. Our estimates can be compared to those by Henderson (1984), who estimated that 5,542-5,507 gray whales were secured and processed by ship-based whalers between 1846 and 1874; Scammon (1874), who believed the total kill over the same period (of eastern gray whales by all whalers in all areas) did not exceed 10,800; and Best (1987), who estimated the total landed catch of gray whales (eastern and western) by American ship-based whalers at 2,665 or 3,013 (method-dependent) from 1850 to 1879. Our new estimates are not high enough to resolve apparent inconsistencies between the catch history and estimates of historical abundance based on genetic variability. We suggest several lines of further research that may help resolve these inconsistencies.",,"catch statistics; commercial activity; feeding ground; genetic variation; survival; whale; whaling; Arctic Ocean; Baja California Sur; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Magdalena Bay; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Ocean; San Ignacio Lagoon; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Palumbi, S.R., Could genetic diversity in eastern.

In addition to gray whales, other cetacean species were also recorded. These observations were summarized compared among survey platforms to ocean conditions. Eleven cetacean species were identified including eight odontocete species (killer whale, Orcinus orca; Pacific white-sided dolphin, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; common dolphin, Delphinus spp.; bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, northern right whale dolphin, Lissodelphis borealis; Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus; Dall's porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli; harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoenaj three mysticete species (humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata/ blue whale, Balaenoptera musculusj. As expected, the detection of certain species among survey platforms (shore-based census watches, 25-power ""Big Eye"" binocular watches, aerial surveys) was limited by species surfacing behavior and/ or bathymétrie preference. Comparisons among the shore-based census efforts showed a significant difference in sightings rates from 1967-84 (n = 14, mean = 0.11, SD = 0.11) to 1985-2007 (n = 11, mean = 1.48, SD = 0.47; t-Test: p < 0.001,df= 23).

Although the 10 or more species of epibenthic mysids found in Clayoquot Sound, BC, Canada, form the primary prey resource for seasonally abundant gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), little is known about their life history. Here, Holmesmysis sculpta dominates multi-species swarms, however there are several potential routes to this state, one of which is higher embryo production. Reproductive capacity is key to the resiliency of local mysid populations and species diversity, in this study I compare one aspect, brood size for the four most commonly found species, H. sculpta, Neomysis rayii, Exacanthomysis davisi, and Columbiaemysis ignota. The number of embryos per brood was found to vary significantly between species; however, individual length is a stronger determinant of brood size. Here, I report previously unknown life history attributes of coastal mysid species, with important consequences for community structure and local marine food webs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"brood size; coastal water; crustacean; embryo; food web; life history; seasonality; species diversity; swarming; sympatry; British Columbia; Canada; Clayoquot Sound; Vancouver Island; Acanthomysis davisi; Cetacea; Crustacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida; Mysidacea; Mysidae; Neomysis rayii",,,,,,,,"Adare, K.I., Lasenby, D.C., Seasonal changes in the total lipid content of the opossum shrimp, Mysis relicta (Malacostraca: Mysidacea) (1994) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 51, pp. 1935-1941; Choi, J.S., Frank, K.T., Leggett, W.C., Drinkwater, K., Transition to an alternate state in a continental shelf ecosystem (2004) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 61, pp. 505-510; Clutter, R.I., The microdistribution and social behaviour of some pelagic mysid shrimps (1969) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 3, pp. 125-155; Crawley, M.J., Timing of disturbance and coexistence in a species-rich ruderal plant community (2004) Ecology, 85 (12), pp. 3277-3288; Duffus, D.A., The recreational use of grey whales in southern Clayoquot Sound, Canada (1996) Appl Geogr, 16 (3), pp. 179-190; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Foraging patterns of gray whales in central Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada (2001) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 223, pp. 299-310; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Diet of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada (2002) Mar Mamm Sci, 18 (2), pp. 419-437; Durbin, G.E., Campbell, R.G., Casas, M.C., Ohman, M.D., Niehoff, B., Runge, J., Wagner, M., Interannual variation in phytoplankton blooms and zooplankton productivity and abundance in the Gulf of Maine during winter (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 254, pp. 81-100; Garnacho, E., Tyler, P.A., Peck, L.S., Reproduction, seasonality, and copper toxicity in the coastal mysid Praunus flexuosus (2001) J Mar Biol Assoc UK, 81, pp. 433-440; Green, J.M., Observation on the behavior and larval development of Acanthomysis sculpta (Tattersall), (Mysidacea) (1970) Can J Zool, 48, pp. 289-292; Hanamura, Y., Seasonal abundance and life cycle of Archaemysis articulate (Crustacea: Mysidacea) on a sandy beach of western Hokkaido, Japan (1999) J Nat Hist, 33, pp. 1811-1830; Hanamura, Y., Siow, R., Chee, P.E., Reproductive biology and seasonality of the Indo-Australasian mysid Mesopodosis orientalis (Crustacea: Mysida) in a tropical mangrove estuary, Malaysia (2008) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 32, pp. 467-474; Johnston, N.T., Northcote, T.G., Life-history variation in Neomysis mercedis Holmes (Crustacea, Mysidacea) in the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia (1989) Can J Zool, 67, pp. 363-372; Johnston, N.M., Ritz, D.A., Fenton, G.E., Larval development in the Tasmanian mysids Anisomysis mixta australis, Tenagomysis tasmaniae and Paramesopodopsis rufa (Crustacea: Mysidacea) (1997) Mar Biol, 130, pp. 93-99; Jones, M.B., Greenwood, J.G., Greenwood, J., Distribution, body size, and brood characteristics of four species of mysids (Crustacea: Peracarida) in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, New Zealand (1989) N Z J Mar Freshw Res, 23, pp. 195-199; Jumars, P., Habitat coupling by mid-latitude, subtidal, marine Mysids: import-subsidized omnivores (2007) Oceanogr Mar Biol, 45, pp. 1-50; Kim, S.L., Oliver, J.S., Swarming benthic crustaceans in the Bering and Chukchi seas and their relation to geographic patterns in gray whale feeding (1989) Can J Zool, 67, pp. 1531-1542; Laskin, D.N., Duffus, D.A., Bender, D.J., Mysteries of the not-so-deep: an investigation into gray whale habitat use along the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (2010) Ocean Globe, pp. 105-120. , 1st edn., J.

In 2008, photo-ID studies were carried out in two areas, off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island and off the southeastern coast of Kamchatka. As a result of the studies, 122 whales known from the Sakhalin gray whale catalogue were photographed. Of them, 97 individuals were registered off Sakhalin, 24, off Kamchatka, and one whale was observed at both sites. In addition, 25 more gray whales that had not been sighted off Sakhalin Island before were found off the coast of Kamchatka. Based on these photographic materials, the whales physical and skin conditions were also analyzed.

Politécnico Nacional s/n, Baja California Sur, Mexico","The numbers of potentially pathogenic microorganisms that have been isolated from stranded cetaceans in the last three decades underscore the urgent need for methods of detection of microorganisms that might cause significant disease and increase the likelihood of population declines. We have designed and implemented two non-invasive techniques for the collection of exhaled breath condensate (blow) from free-ranging whales and demonstrated their suitability for the detection of respiratory bacteria. We successfully collected 22 individual blow samples from eight cetacean species. Using well-established molecular techniques we detected three bacterial genera (Haemophilus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus). Haemophilus spp. was detected in fin whale Balaenoptera physalus, sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and gray whale Eschrichtius robustus blows, while unidentified β-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in gray whale and blue whale Balaenoptera musculus blows. The detection limit of the test was determined as 1 CFU mL-1. None of the identified bacteria were found in environmental (control) samples, suggesting that their presence in the blows was genuine and not due to inadvertent contamination. While the population-level relevance of these bacteria is as yet unclear and it is possible that they are commensal microorganisms, S. aureus has been identified previously as a high-risk pathogen to cetacean health, and streptococci have increasingly been associated with cetacean mortality events. We suggest that future cetacean monitoring programs of vulnerable or threatened species include blow sampling as a means to determine the prevalence of the respiratory bacteria in the populations and monitor spatiotemporal fluctuations as indicators of changes in cetacean health. © 2009 The Authors.

One important aspect to consider in the assessment of habitat suitability and the underlying mechanism of animal distribution is the spatial distribution of their food resources. In marine areas, where many mammal and bird species occur over large spatial scales, the analysis of habitat use and distribution patterns requires information on the distribution of food resources at appropriately large scales (Huettmann and Diamond 2006). An important food resource for several species of marine birds and mammals are invertebrate organisms that live on the bottom of the sea and are collectively described as the benthos, a community that is especially productive and diverse at high latitudes (Carey 1991; Piepenburg 2005; Starmans et al. 1999). The distribution and productivity of benthic foragers such as ice seals, walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), sea ducks (Somateria spp., Melanitta spp.), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) is influenced by the distribution of accessible benthic prey resources (Kaiser et al. 2006; Lovvorn et al. 2003; Moore et al. 2003). Benthic invertebrates thus form a key component in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems, and the distribution of marine benthic invertebrates is of major interest to wildlife managers (Solan et al. 2004). Most of the species mentioned above are of management concern, and either are (Spectacled Eider, Somateria fischeri; Steller's Eider, Polysticta stelleri) or have been proposed (walrus, ice seals) to be listed as 'threatened'. Therefore, the identification and delineation of critical habitat providing sufficient food resources for these species will become extremely important in the near future. © Springer 2010.
