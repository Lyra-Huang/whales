Data were collected on sixteen California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) quarterly cruises (lines 77-93) from July 2004-March 2008.The most frequently sighted large whales were humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, 67 sightings), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus, 52 sightings), and blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus, 36 sightings). Blue and humpback whale sightings peaked in summer (July/August) and fin whales were most frequently seen in summer and fall, consistent with known migratory patterns. In spring through fall, whale sighting locations were associated with colder SST and greater zooplankton abundance levels compared to averages from random locations on the trackline.These results support the hypothesis that foraging distributions of large whales are linked to cold surface temperatures, which may indicate processes that enhance prey production and accumulation, such as upwelling or advection of productive water within the California Current. However, winter distributions of whales presumed to be migrating do not appear to be related to the habitat variables we analyzed, and may be harder to predict based on oceanographic data.The frequency of CalCOFI cruises provides us with high temporal resolution and an ongoing, long time series compared to other survey efforts, allowing comparison between seasons and years that will increase our understanding of these top predators and their response to habitat variability within an important subregion of the California Current Ecosystem.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem (2007) Fish.

Low-frequency ocean noise has increased in recent decades, often in habitats with seasonally resident populations of marine mammals, raising concerns that noise chronically influences life histories of individuals and populations. In contrast to physical harm from intense anthropogenic sources, which can have acute impacts on individuals, masking from chronic noise sources has been difficult to quantify at individual or population levels, and resulting effects have been even more difficult to assess. This paper presents an analytical paradigm to quantify changes in an animal's acoustic communication space as a result of spatial, spectral, and temporal changes in background noise, providing a functional definition of communication masking for free-ranging animals and a metric to quantify the potential for communication masking. We use the sonar equation, a combination of modeling and analytical techniques, and measurements from empirical data to calculate time-varying spatial maps of potential communication space for singing fin (Balaenoptera physalus), singing humpback (Megoptera novaeangliae), and calling right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales. These illustrate how the measured loss of communication space as a result of differing levels of noise is converted into a time-varying measure of communication masking.

The fin whale is a slender balaenopterid, its maximum girth being between 40% and 50% of the total length. The rostrum is narrow, with a single, well-developed longitudinal ridge. The fin whale is a cosmopolitan cetacean. It is found in most large water masses of the world, from the Equator to the polar regions. However, in the most extreme latitudes it may be absent near the ice limit; thus, it has not been reported off northern Novaya Zemlya or Franz Josef Land in the Northern Hemisphere or in the Weddell or Bellinghausen seas in the Antarctic. The fin whale feeds on a wide variety of organisms, depending on availability. Possibly, diet varies with season and locality. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Monthly values for satellite-derived oceanographic data and whale call data were compared for 4 regions (30° longitude by 15° of latitude) encompassing the whole subarctic North Pacific and an area in the temperate northeastern Pacific. To determine predictive models for whale call occurrence, generalized linear models were used to determine which, if any, oceanographic variables might influence whale calling behavior over such broad space and time scales.

Numerous bones of gregarious dolphins in a site of the Jomon Era (10,000 bp-3200 bc) on the Noto coasts, Sea of Japan, suggest the presence of a drive fishery. Other sites of similar antiquity on the Pacific coasts of central and northern Japan and on the coasts of northern Kyushu facing the Sea of Japan/East China Sea revealed remains of small cetaceans and detachable harpoon heads. The Okhotsk Sea culture of Hokkaido in the fifth to fourteenth centuries left skeletons, harpoons, and drawings depicting whale harpooning. Harpooning whales that are found in a harbor could have taken place widely. Records of such takes in a harbor at Ine, Sea of Japan, included 167 humpback, 148 fin (. Balaenoptera physalus), and 40 right whales in the period 1656-1913. A village next to Ine took small cetaceans in the same way. A similar fishery was also recorded in the fourteenth century at villages on Tsushima Island, off northern Kyushu. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Trichechus spp.), and polar bears (. Ursus maritimus). Understandably, there is much and growing public interest in these rendezvous. Individuals of these species are sentient beings (capable of experiencing pleasure and pain) and sentience must influence how we interact with them. New scientific data appear that force us to rethink what we know and to revise our stereotypes. For example, spindle cells, which were long thought to exist only in humans and other great apes, have been discovered in humpback whales (. Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whales (. Balaenoptera physalus), killer whales (. Orcinus orca), and sperm whales (. Physeter macrocephalus) in the same area of their brains as spindle cells in human brains. This brain region is linked with social organization, empathy, and intuition about the feelings of others, as well as rapid gut reactions. Spindle cells are important in processing emotions. There is also a growing database showing that fish are sentient beings that experience pain and suffering and that dolphins and other cetaceans are highly intelligent and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain and have remarkable social and cognitive skills. Indeed, dolphins and other marine mammals seem to fulfill some criteria of ersonhood in that they are aware of their surroundings, sentient, and may have a sense of self. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We examined tissues from adult killer whales and detected a novel gammaretrovirus by degenerate PCR. Reverse transcription-PCR also demonstrated tissue and serum expression of retroviral mRNA. The full-length sequence of the provirus was obtained by PCR, and a TaqMan-based copy number assay did not demonstrate evidence of productive infection. PCR on blood samples from 11 healthy captive killer whales and tissues from 3 free-ranging animals detected the proviral DNA in all tissues examined from all animals. A survey of multiple cetacean species by PCR for gag, pol, and env sequences showed homologs of this virus in the DNA of eight species of delphinids, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, and harbor porpoises, but not in beluga or fin whales. Analysis of the bottlenose dolphin genome revealed two full-length proviral sequences with 97.4% and 96.9% nucleotide identity to the killer whale gammaretrovirus. The results of single-cell PCR on killer whale sperm and Southern blotting are also consistent with the conclusion that the provirus is endogenous. We suggest that this gammaretrovirus entered the delphinoid ancestor's genome before the divergence of modern dolphins or that an exogenous variant existed following divergence that was ultimately endogenized. However, the transcriptional activity demonstrated in tissues and the nearly intact viral genome suggest a more recent integration into the killer whale genome, favoring the latter hypothesis. The proposed name for this retrovirus is killer whale endogenous retrovirus. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

As a consequence, there has been only limited use of active acoustic techniques by marine mammal researchers. Instead more attention has been given to the development and use of passive acoustic methods for the detection of cetaceans. Nevertheless there is great potential for the use of active acoustic systems in ecological studies, and studies aimed at improving conservation of whales and dolphins in their natural environment: active acoustic techniques can be used for the good of cetaceans, and should not just be considered a source of disturbance. We evaluated the capability of various acoustic systems - systems that are used commonly in fisheries research - to detect and track cetaceans underwater. We collected data initially with standard scientific echosounders (SIMRAD EK500) from moving vessels and from fixed moorings (EK60) at 38 and 120 kHz. Scientific echosounders have narrow beams and therefore enable sampling from only fixed and limited volumes. To overcome these limitations we progressed to use high frequency omnidirectional sonar (SIMRAD SH80) operating at 110 kHz. During Norwegian Sea ecosystem surveys (2006-2008) we recorded the backscatter energy from three species of large whales: Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeanglie). During the observations no avoidance reactions by cetaceans were observed, even when the vessel's entire suite of active acoustic instruments were running (frequency range from 18 kHz to 200 kHz, maximum source level 210 dB re 1 μPa (at 20 and 110 kHz). Here we present a small sample of data from two Fin whales that show the animals backscatter response at broadside. In addition, we give an overview of the present status and possible future development of the use of standard active acoustic methods for cetacean studies. Omnidirectional sonar shows great potential as a tool for marine mammal detection, and could be developed to produce an automatic cetacean detector. Such a detector would be a highly valuable aid for seismic mitigation and ship strike prevention, and in addition could contribute to behavioural studies with its high definition time scale. Much work is required to understand relationships between cetacean body shape, physiology, kinematics and acoustic reflectivity, before a detector can be realized.",,"Acoustic method; Acoustic systems; Acoustic techniques; Active sonar; Body shapes; Echo sounders; Ecological studies; Frequency ranges; High definition; High frequency; Humpback whales; Marine environment; Marine mammals; Minke whales; Narrow beams; Natural environments; Passive acoustics; Possible futures; Present status; Seismic mitigation; Small samples; Sonar use; Source level; Time-scales; Acoustic fields; Backscattering; Ecology; Fins (heat exchange); Mammals; Profilometry; Sonar; Tracking (position); Underwater acoustics; Bioacoustics",,,,,,,"Axelsen, B.E., Anker-Nilssen, T., Fossum, P., Kvamme, C., Nøttestad, L., Pretty patterns but a simple strategy: Predator-prey interactions between juvenile herring and atlantic puffins observed with multibeam sonar (2001) Can.

The records of Mesoplodon mirus and M. bowdoini represent significant extensions to their known distribution.

We examined the spatio-temporal relationships between oceanographic features and abundance of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest free-ranging predator in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WM), through two independent approaches. First, spatial modeling was used to estimate whale density, using waiting distance (the distance between detections) for fin whales along ferry routes across the WM, in relation to remotely sensed oceanographic parameters. At a large scale (basin and year), fin whales exhibited fidelity to the northern WM with a summer-aggregated and winter-dispersed pattern. At mesoscale (20-100. km), whales were found in colder, saltier (from an on-board system) and dynamic areas defined by steep altimetric and temperature gradients. Second, using an independent fin whale satellite tracking dataset, we showed that tracked whales were effectively preferentially located in favorable habitats, i.e. in areas of high predicted densities as identified by our previous model using oceanographic data contemporaneous to the tracking period. We suggest that the large-scale fidelity corresponds to temporally and spatially predictable habitat of whale favorite prey, the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), while mesoscale relationships are likely to identify areas of high prey concentration and availability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Foraging predator; Habitat use; Mesoscale oceanographic processes; Spatial and temporal scales; Whale","Foraging predator; Habitat use; Oceanographic process; Temporal scale; Whale; Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Fins (heat exchange); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Meganyctiphanes norvegica",,,,,"CanceropÃ´le Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te dâAzur

Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) songs present a unique opportunity to determine interstock differences. Their highly stereotyped interpulse interval has been shown to vary between geographic areas and to remain stable over time in some areas. In this study the structure of songs recorded at two geographically close feeding aggregations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Gulf of Maine (GoM) was compared. Recordings were made from September 2005 through February 2006 in the GSL and intermittently between January 2006 and September 2007 at two locations in the GoM. 6257 pulse intervals corresponding to 19 GSL and 29 GoM songs were measured to characterize songs from both areas. Classification trees showed that GSL songs differ significantly from those in the GoM. The results are consistent with those derived from other stock structure assessment methodologies, such as chemical signature and photoidentification analysis, suggesting that fin whales in these areas may form separate management stocks. Song structure analysis could therefore provide a useful and cost-efficient tool for defining conservation units over temporal and geographical scales relevant to management objectives in fin whales. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic datum; Assessment methodologies; Chemical signatures; Classification trees; Conservation units; Cost-efficient; Geographic areas; Geographic variations; Geographical scale; Gulf of maine; Interpulse intervals; Management objectives; Marine mammals; Northwest atlantic; Song structures; Mammals; Population statistics; Fins (heat exchange); Animals; Fin Whale; Geography; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"Marisla Foundation

Location : The study area included all major inland waters of Southeast Alaska. Methods : Between 1991 and 2007, cetacean surveys were conducted by observers who kept a constant watch when the vessel was underway and recorded all cetaceans encountered. For each species, we examined distributional patterns, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends. Analysis of variance (anovaF) was used to test for differences in group sizes between multiple means, and Student's t-test was used to detect differences between pairwise means. Cetacean seasonal occurrence and annual trends were investigated using a generalized linear model framework. Results : Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were seen throughout the region, with numbers lowest in spring and highest in the fall. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) distributions were more restricted than that reported for humpback whales, and the low number of sightings precluded evaluating seasonal trends. Three killer whale (Orcinus orca) eco-types were documented with distributions occurring throughout inland waters. Seasonal patterns were not detected or could not be evaluated for resident and offshore killer whales, respectively; however, the transient eco-type was more abundant in the summer. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were distributed throughout the region, with more sightings in spring and summer than in fall. Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution was clumped, with concentrations occurring in the Icy Strait/Glacier Bay and Wrangell areas and with no evidence of seasonality. Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) were observed only occasionally, with more sightings in the spring. For most species, group size varied on both an annual and seasonal basis. Main conclusions : Seven cetacean species occupy the inland waters of Southeast Alaska, with distribution, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends varying by species. Future studies that compare spatial and temporal patterns with other features (e.g. oceanography, prey resources) may help in identifying the key factors that support the high density and biodiversity of cetaceans found in this region. An increased understanding of the region's marine ecology is an essential step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of cetaceans in Southeast Alaska. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Annual trends; Cetaceans; Distribution; Group size; Multi-year investigations; Seasonal occurrence; Southeast Alaska","biodiversity; biological survey; cetacean; ecotype; group size; inland sea; marine ecosystem; population distribution; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; species occurrence; variance analysis; zoogeography; Alaska; North America; United States; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., The killer whale - Foraging specializations and group hunting (2000) Cetacean Societies: Field Studies on Dolphins and Whales, pp. 127-153. , ed. by.

In the Mediterranean Sea, changes in bio-chemical and physical seawater properties resulting from global warming are likely to alter marine biodiversity and productivity, trigger trophic web mismatches and encourage diseases, toxic algal bloom and propagation of thermophilic species. This review highlights the current and potential threats of climate change to the Mediterranean marine ecosystems, including cetaceans, and stresses the emergent necessity for more integrated regulations and policies for the protection of marine biodiversity. For instance, in the Mediterranean Sea, the distribution and abundance of the small euphausid species Meganyctiphanes norvegica is correlated with specific hydrobiological parameters including seawater temperature, salinity and current patterns. Situated at the northern limit of its ecological tolerance, this species, which constitutes the only known food supply of the fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in this region, might be affected by climate change-induced alteration of ocean circulation. © 2008 Copyright Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cetaceans; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Marine ecosystems; Mediterranean; Potential impacts","algal bloom; biodiversity; cetacean; climate change; climate effect; emission; food supply; food web; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; hydrobiology; marine ecosystem; thermophily; whale; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; algae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Meganyctiphanes norvegica",,,,,,,,"Gambaiani, D.

We summarize fin whale Balaenoptera physalus catch statistics, sighting data, mark recov-eries and acoustics data. The annual cycle of most populations of fin whales had been thought to entail regular migrations between high-latitude summer feeding grounds and lower-latitude winter grounds. Here we present evidence of more complex and varied movement patterns. 2. During summer, fin whales range from the Chukchi Sea south to 35 oN on the Sanriku coast of Honshu, to the Subarctic Boundary (ca. 42 oN) in the western and central Pacific, and to 32 oN off the coast of California. Catches show concentrations in seven areas which we refer to as 'grounds', representing productive feeding areas. 3. During winter months, whales have been documented over a wide area from 60 oN south to 23 oN. Coastal whalers took them regularly in all winter months around Korea and Japan and they have been seen regularly in winter off southern California and northern Baja California. There are also numerous fin whale sightings and acoustic detections north of 40 oN during winter months. Calves are born during the winter, but there is little evidence for distinct calving areas. 4. Whales implanted with Discovery-type marks were killed in whaling operations, and location data from 198 marked whales demonstrate local site fidelity, consistent movements within and between the main summer grounds and long migrations from low-latitude winter grounds to high-latitude summer grounds. 5. The distributional data agree with immunogenetic and marking findings which suggest that the migratory population segregates into at least two demes with separate winter mating grounds: a western ground off the coast of Asia and an eastern one off the American coast. Members of the two demes probably mingle in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands area. 6. Prior research had suggested that there were at least two non-migratory stocks of fin whale: one in the East China Sea and another in the Gulf of California. There is equivocal evidence for the existence of additional non-migratory groups in the Sanriku-Hokkaido area off Japan and possibly the northern Sea of Japan, but this is based on small sample sizes. © 2009 The Authors.

By accelerating to high speeds and by opening their mouth to large gape angles, these whales generate the water pressure required to expand their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water. Such large influx is facilitated by highly extensible ventral groove blubber (VGB) associated with the walls of the throat (buccal cavity). Based on the mechanical properties of this tissue, previous studies have assumed lunge-feeding to be an entirely passive process, where the flow-induced pressure driving the expansion of the VGB is met with little resistance. Such compliant engulfment would be facilitated by the compliant properties of the VGB that have been measured on dead specimens. However, adjoining the ventral blubber are several layers of well-developed muscle embedded with mechanoreceptors, thereby suggesting a capability to gauge the magnitude of engulfed water and use eccentric muscle action to control the flux of water into the mouth. An unsteady hydrodynamic model of fin whale lunge-feeding is presented here to test whether engulfment is exclusively passive and compliant or involves muscle action. The model is based on the explicit simulation of the engulfed water as it interacts with the buccal cavity walls of the whale, under different heuristically motivated cavity forces. Our results, together with their comparison with velocity data collected in the field, suggest that adult rorquals actively push engulfed water forward from the very onset of mouth opening in order to successfully complete a lunge. Interestingly, such an action involves a reflux of the engulfed mass rather than the oft-assumed rebound, which would occur mainly at the very end of a lunge sequence dominated by compliant engulfment. Given the great mass of the engulfed water, reflux creation adds a significant source of hydrodynamic drag to the lunge process, but with the benefit of helping to circumvent the problem of removing prey from baleen by enhancing the efficiency of cross-flow filtration after mouth closing. Reflux management for a successful lunge will therefore demand well-coordinated muscular actions of the tail, mouth and ventral cavity. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Hydrodynamics; Lunge-feeding; Rorqual whales","Biomechanics; Feeding; Fins (heat exchange); Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Mechanical properties; Muscle; Simulators; Cavity wall; Cross flow filtration; Engulfment; Hydrodynamic drag; Hydrodynamic model; Lunge-feeding; Mechanoreceptors; Muscle action; Muscular actions; Rorqual whales; Trajectory simulation; Water pressures; Water filtration; animal behavior; article; feeding behavior; flow; hydrodynamics; kinematics; lunge feeding; mechanoreceptor; mouth cavity; nonhuman; predation; pressure; swimming; throat; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J.

Call characteristics were compared among sites using the average pressure spectrum levels from 1 month of data at each location. Presence of calls was analyzed using automatic call detection and acoustic power analysis methods. Blue whale calls were recorded year-round, with the highest detections in February-May and November. This suggests that the blue whale population may not migrate synchronously, and may indicate long duration calls are more common during migrations. Fin whale calls were detected only during February-July. Two distinct fin whale call types were recorded, suggesting a possible separation into two populations. The calls at the EA site had a secondary frequency peak in the pressure spectrum at 99 Hz and the calls at the WAP and the SS sites had a peak at 89 Hz. No fin whale calls were detected at the RS site. Acoustics are a good tool to monitor large whales in the Southern Ocean. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Blue whale; Circumpolar; Distribution; Fin whale; Passive acoustics; Southern Ocean","acoustic method; calling behavior; geographical distribution; migration; seasonal variation; spatial variation; species occurrence; whale; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; Ross Sea; Scotia Sea; Southern Ocean; West Antarctica; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Branch, T.A., Butterworth, D.S., Estimates of abundance south of 60°S for cetacean species sighted frequently on the 1978/79 to 1997/98 IWC/IDCR-SOWER sighting surveys (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 3, pp. 251-270. , and; Branch, T.A., Matsuoka, K., Miyashita, T., Evidence for increases in Antarctic blue whales based on Bayesian modelling (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20, pp. 726-754. , and; Branch, T.A., Stafford, K.M., Palacios, D.M., Past and present distribution, densities, and movements of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean (2007) Mammal Review, 37, pp. 116-175. , and. 39. others; Brown, S.G., Dispersal in blue and fin whales (1954) Discovery Reports, 26, pp. 355-384; Brown, S.G., A note on migration of fin whales (1962) Norsk Hvalfangst-Tidende, 51, pp. 13-16; Brown, S.G., The movements of fin and blue whales within the Antarctic zone (1962) Discovery Reports, 33, pp. 1-54; Clapham, P.J., Baker, C.S., (2001) How Many Whales Were Killed in the Southern Hemisphere in the 20th Century?, , and.

Although the kinematics of lunge feeding in fin whales supports this hypothesis, it is unclear whether respiratory compensation occurs as a consequence of lunge-feeding activity. We used high-resolution digital tags on foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) to determine the number of lunges executed per dive as well as respiratory frequency between dives. Data from two whales are reported, which together performed 58 foraging dives and 451 lunges. During one study, we tracked one tagged whale for approximately 2h and examined the spatial distribution of prey using a digital echosounder. These data were integrated with the dive profile to reveal that lunges are directed toward the upper boundary of dense krill aggregations. Foraging dives were characterized by a gliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady swimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these extended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken after a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half of those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales. At the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate was at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that underwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high energetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also occurs in intermediate sized rorquals.","Diving; Foraging; Whale","animal; article; biomechanics; breathing; diving; feeding behavior; humpback whale; physiology; time; Animals; Biomechanics; Diving; Feeding Behavior; Humpback Whale; Respiration; Time Factors; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Megaptera",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J.

Therefore, a prediction model of fin whale's (Balaenoptera physalus) summer distribution was developed from data collected between May and August, in the Pelagos Mediterranean Marine Mammals Sanctuary. Explanatory variables were selected by multiple logistic regression, among several physiographic and oceanographic parameters. Depth, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentration, and sea surface temperature (SST) were selected for characterizing fin whale presence. Remote sensing imagery (Chl a and SST) was used at an 8-d resolution to capture short-term environmental variability. With the selection of a presence/absence threshold by the receiver operating characteristic curve, a correct classification of 70% (49% for presence, 85% for absence) was achieved for the initial dataset. Model reliability was also tested on an independent dataset, collected in the northwestern Basin; a correct classification of 71% (41% for presence prediction, 86% for absence prediction) was obtained. This study contributes to an understanding of where fin whales might concentrate to feed in summer. Weekly predictions of their distribution represent a valuable conservation tool in a marine protected area, for example to prevent collisions with ships. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Its exceptional high abundance during the summer period in the north-western Mediterranean is essentially due to productive waters, but outside of this spatio-temporal window its distribution still remains quite unknown. This paper investigates the distribution of the fin whale on large-scales during the 2002-2006 period. Three areas of the central Mediterranean Sea were selected: the Ligurian Sea in the north-western Mediterranean belonging to the Pelagos Sanctuary; the area connecting both Mediterranean basins in the south-western Mediterranean, the Strait of Messina; and the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa, in the central Mediterranean. Of the 41,270 km covered by the three surveys, a total of 98 sightings was recorded corresponding to 198 fin whales. Results display a year round distribution along synchronic seasonal dispatching, with a feeding behaviour occurrence in the northern part of the Pelagos Sanctuary during late spring and summer. They indicate high abundance in the Lampedusa area from late winter to early spring manifesting feeding activity. In the Strait of Messina, our results point out the importance of this area as a seasonal feeding ground and an important location for regular autumn transfers between both Mediterranean basins. According to the feeding ground in the two Mediterranean basins, whales change foraging strategy, one being single animals or animal pairs searching for prey in the water column while the other strategy is associated with more individuals feeding on the surface. The strategies differ also by their ecological conditions, such as depth affinity and shoreline distance. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Central Mediterranean; Feeding behaviour; Fin whale; Group size; Sea topography; Seasonal distribution","abundance; feeding ground; foraging behavior; group size; population distribution; seasonal variation; shoreline; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; whale; Agrigento; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Lampedusa; Mediterranean Sea; Pelagi Islands; Pelagos Sanctuary; Sicily; Southern Europe; Strait of Messina; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Anderson, V., Sardou, J., Nival, P., The diel migrations and vertical distributions of zooplankton and micronecton in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea.

We examined 130 records (from 1980-2006) of large whale strandings in Washington State. Nineteen strandings (seven species) had evidence of ship-strikes. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) had the highest incidence of ante-mortem ship strike (five of seven, with the remaining two possibly post-mortem) and all but one occurring since 2002. Six grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) suffered 'possible ship strike' injuries, likely the result of their large numbers in the area, rather than high levels of ship strikes. Only one possible ship-struck humpback whale was recorded, despite concentrations of humpbacks feeding within shipping lanes in this region. This study shows dramatic differences in occurrences of ship-struck large whales by species, which we believe results from a combination of species' vulnerability to ship strikes, and how likely a struck whale is to be caught up on the bow of a ship and brought to waters where it can be examined. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Balaenoptera physalus; Grey whale; Immature fin whale; Ship strike; Stranding; Washington State","anthropogenic effect; community response; marine record; mortality; species occurrence; stranding; vulnerability; whale; North America; United States; Washington [United States]; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Lockyer, C.H., Growth, physical maturity, and mortality of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) inhabiting the temperate waters of the northeast Atlantic (1987) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 65, pp. 253-264; Allison, P.A., Smith, C.R., Kukert, H., Deming, J.W., Bennett, B.A., Deep-water taphonomy of vertebrate carcasses: A whale skeleton in the bathyal Santa Catalina Basin (1991) Paleobiology, 17, pp. 78-89; Andre M., Terada M. and Watanabe Y.

Relationships with temperature were investigated for: striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data were studied. A series of 20 monthly images (i.e. June to September monthly images from 1996 to 2000) was considered. Concurrently, distribution data collected during shipboard summer surveys, and covering an area of about 20,000 km2 in the western Ligurian Sea, were analysed. The relationship between the three species presence and SST was investigated by using a grid of 3 x 3 nautical mile cell units. For every cell the SST mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variance and the deviation from the monthly average were calculated. Finally, binary logistic regression functions allowed to assess significant (P &lt; 0.05) relationships with temperature in these species. These logistic models, were able to predict 60-78% of the species presence(1)/absence(0) cells, and suggest the need for further investigations spanning longer time periods to assess how the global climate change has been changing and will change in the future cetacean distribution in the western Ligurian Sea. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cetaceans; Climate change; Distribution; Habitat; Western Ligurian Sea","cetacean; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; global warming; population distribution; population modeling; regression analysis; remote sensing; sea surface temperature; species diversity; temperature effect; temporal analysis; variance analysis; Ligurian Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba",,,,,,,"Afifi, A., Clark, V., (1996) Computer-aided multivariate analysis, , London: Chapman & Hall; Allan, R., Lindesay, J., Parker, D., (1996) El Niño Southern Oscillation and climate variability, , Collingwood, Australia: CSIRO; Azzellino, A., Airoldi, S., Gaspari, S., Nani, B., Habitat use and preferences of cetaceans along the continental slope and the adjacent pelagic waters in the western Ligurian Sea Deep-Sea Research Part I, , in press; Boots, B.N., Getis, A., (1988) Point pattern analysis.

The survey covered the area between Cape Farewell and Disko Island on the West Greenland coast out to the 200m depth contour. The surveyed area covered 163,574km 2 and a total of 246 sightings of 9 cetacean species were obtained. Abundance estimates were developed for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (21 sightings), fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus (78 sightings) and common minke whales, B. acutorostrata (42 sightings). The mean group size of humpback whales was 3.30 but groups as large as 95 animals were seen off effort. The mean group size of fin whales was 2.96 with groups as large as 50 seen. Common minke whale group size was 1.1 with only one sighting of a group of two whales. Humpback whales were found both in offshore and coastal areas of West Greenland with the exception of Store Hellefiske Bank and the Cape Farewell offshore area. The line transect abundance estimate of humpback whales was 1, 218 (CV=0.56), uncorrected for submerged whales (availability bias) and whales that were available to be seen but were missed by the observers (perception bias). Fin whales were observed in all areas of the survey and the uncorrected line transect estimate was 1, 660 (CV=0.38). When corrected for perception bias the estimates increases to 3,234 fin whales (CV=0.44). Common minke whales were found in almost equal densities in all strata except for the Cape Farewell offshore area, where none were seen. The cue-counting abundance estimate of common minke whales was 4, 856 (CV=0.49) for West Greenland using a cue rate of 46.3 cues per hour (CV=0.11). If the estimate is corrected for perception bias the common minke whale abundance is estimated to be 10,792 whales (CV=0.59). Low coverage was attained in the northern area of West Greenland and this should cause an especially large negative bias for the estimates of fin whale and humpback whale abundance because this area is believed to have particularly large densities of these whales.","Abundance estimate; Common minke whale; Cue counting; Distribution; Fin whale; g(0); Humpback whale; Northern hemisphere; School size; Survey-Aerial; Survey-Vessel","abundance estimation; aerial survey; demographic survey; Northern Hemisphere; population density; spatial distribution; whale; Arctic; Cape Farewell; Disko Island; Egger Island; Greenland; West Greenland; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Hedley, S.L., Southern Hemisphere group IV humpback whales: Their status from recent aerial survey (2001) Mem.

For three years, monitoring has been conducted from five motor vessels covering about 30,050 km. The most frequently encountered species were the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba representing 64.7% of all sightings, the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (17.0%), Cuvier's beaked whale Ziphius cavirostris (9.9%), Risso's dolphin Grampus griseus (4.3%) and the sperm whale Physeter catodon (2.2%). Sightings' positions and effort coverage were distributed over a grid of 5′ longitude and 5′ latitude. Spatial concentrations of sightings were analysed according to the distribution of effort to identify 'hotspots' (locations where the species occurred at a significantly greater frequency than expected), and 'coldspots' (locations with a significantly lower frequency than expected). Most fin whale hotspots (14) were located on the bathyal plain between 2000 and 2500 m, four hotspots were around the 1000 m isobaths, and one is located close to the seamount off Genoa. Fin whale coldspots were mainly along the coast. Striped dolphin hotspots were widely distributed over two main areas, in waters with depths between 2000 and 2500 m and at the continental slope; coldspots for this species were also mainly along the coast in the northern part of the study area. Many hotspots were found in the Genoa Canyon, and hotspots of striped dolphins, Cuvier's beaked whales, sperm whales and Risso's dolphins overlapped in this region. Some of the hotspots of Cuvier's beaked whales were identified at the seamount in the study area, where no other species was sighted frequently. Risso's dolphin hotspots were mainly near the 1000 m isobath. For sperm whales, several hotspots were identified: three associated with steep slope features (such as canyons or the continental slope), and one was in the centre of the flat area of Pelagos where the depth is 2500 m. This study highlights the ecological importance of particular locations inside the Pelagos Sanctuary - locations that should be protected from anthropogenic degradations for marine mammal conservation. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cetacean distribution; Hotspots; Marine protected area; Mediterranean Sea","bathyal zone; cetacean; human activity; marine park; niche overlap; niche partitioning; population distribution; seamount; species conservation; species diversity; Mediterranean Sea; Pelagos Sanctuary; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Grampus griseus; Mammalia; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba; Ziphiidae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Aïssi M., Celona A., Comparetto G., Mangano R., Würtz M. and Moulins A.

Sars conducted a multi-disciplinary survey along the mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) from the Reykjanes Ridge to north of the Azores. This provided the first systematic survey information on MAR cetacean populations. Using naked eye or 7×50 hand-held binoculars, observers searched in a 140° arc centred along the ships' heading. Eleven cetacean species and 10 other taxonomic groups were identified along 2,321km of transect effort. The sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) were the most commonly sighted species (53 and 48 sightings, respectively). There were 12 sightings of the fin whale (B. physalus). There were 26, 13 and 12 sightings, respectively of the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), pilot whale (Globicephala sp.) and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). Density estimates of species ranged from 0.018 to 0.238 animals km-2. The precision of the estimates (CV) was low, ranging from 40% to 61%. Species distribution varied north to south; the highest aggregations of baleen whales were sighted at the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ). Sperm whales were also observed at the CGFZ as well as north of this area. Pilot whales and Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) were sighted mainly in the cold (5-16°C) and less saline (34.6-35.8%c) water masses along the Reykjanes Ridge. Conversely, common dolphins and striped dolphins were most commonly sighted south of the CGFZ in areas with warmer (12-22°C) and more saline (34.8-36.7%c) surface water temperatures.","Abundance estimate; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic white-sided dolphin; Common dolphin; Distribution; Fin whale; Northern hemisphere; Pilot whale; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Striped dolphin; Survey-Vessel","aggregation behavior; cetacean; demographic survey; dolphin; Northern Hemisphere; population density; population estimation; spatial distribution; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala sp.; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Mysticeti; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba",,,,,,,"Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Cetaceans of the Western Tropical Indian Ocean: Distribution, relative abundance, and comparisons with cetacean communities of two other tropical ecosystems (1998) Mar.

This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 2′ latitude by 2′ longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 °C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

During 2003 and 2004, 4 field trips per year were carried out (winter-spring, spring, summer, and autumn). Systematic line transects and random surveys for whales were conducted in small boats (6 m) and euphausiid swarms were sampled with a zooplankton net. Fin whales foraged mostly in shallow waters (10-100 m) off the west and south coast of Coronado Island and were observed feeding on 18 of 19 swarms of Nyctiphanes simplex (5 in 2003 and 14 in 2004). Swarms occurred from March to early August and were almost absent from October to November. Although fin whales were sighted throughout the study area, there was a characteristic distribution pattern of feeding activity, mainly during spring and summer seasons. Examination of our data shows that the adjacent waters off Coronado Island constitute a unique seasonal foraging habitat for fin whales in the Gulf of California. © 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.","Balaenoptera physalus; Euphausiids; Fin whale; Gulf of California; Nyctiphanes simplex; Surface swarms","crustacean; feeding ground; foraging behavior; identification method; insect; line transect; shallow water; swarming; whale; zooplankton; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; Ballenas Channel; Mexico [North America]; North America; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Euphausiidae; Nyctiphanes simplex",,,,,,,"AGLER, B.

The structures of recorded calls were broadly similar to those reported from other areas, but lacked the stereotypical patterning of those signals thought to represent reproductive displays. Counts of non-patterned blue whale calls indicated low vocalisation rates, with a mean of 0.62 phrases per whale per hour (0.12 A-B and 0.49 arch phrases per whale per hour). However, vocalisations were highly clustered in time, with 80% of blue whale calls ascribed to the focal animals arriving within a single 80 second period. It is not clear what behavioural, geographical or seasonal trends may influence the vocalisation rate of large baleen whales, and thus direct comparisons between areas are difficult. However, it is hoped the results presented will be of use in interpreting remote recordings of blue whales made from the North Atlantic. Hydrophones were also monitored continuously over 7,757km of trackline using an automated detection algorithm developed for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, no North Atlantic right whales were seen or heard during the study period.","Acoustics; Atlantic Ocean; Blue whale; Fin whale; North Atlantic right whale; Northern Hemisphere; Survey-acoustic; Vocalisation","acoustic survey; algorithm; behavioral ecology; detection method; hydrophone; seasonality; signaling; vocalization; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Eurasia; Europe; Greenland; Iceland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Bass, A.H., Clark, C.W., The physical acoustics of underwater sound communication (2003) Acoustic Communication: Springer Handbook of Auditory Research, pp. 15-64. , Fay, R. and Popper, A, eds, Springer-Verlag, New York; Berchok, C.L., Bradley, D.L., Gabrielson, T.B., St. Lawrence blue whale vocalizations revisited: Characterisation of calls detected from 1998 to 2001 (2006) J.

Gadio 2, 20121 Milano, Italy; Nani, B., BluWest, via Scarincio 12, Imperia, Italy","The physical habitat of cetaceans occurring along the continental slope in the western Ligurian Sea was investigated. Data were collected from two different sighting platforms, one of the two being a whale-watching boat. Surveys, conducted from May to October and from 1996 to 2000, covered an area of approximately 3000 km2 with a mean effort of about 10,000 km year-1. A total of 814 sightings was reported, including all the species occurring in the area: Stenella coeruleoalba, Balaenoptera physalus, Physeter macrocephalus, Globicephala melas, Grampus griseus, Ziphius cavirostris, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis. A Geographic Information System was used to integrate sighting data to a set of environmental characteristics, which included bottom gradient, area between different isobaths, and length and linearity of the isobaths within a cell unit. Habitat use was analysed by means of a multi-dimensional scaling, MDS, analysis. Significant differences were found in the habitat preference of most of the species regularly occurring in the area. Bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale were found strongly associated to well-defined depth and slope gradient characteristics of the shelf-edge and the upper and lower slope. The hypothesis of habitat segregation was considered for Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale. Canonical discriminant functions using depth and slope as predictors outlined clear and not overlapping habitat preferences for Risso's dolphin and Cuvier's beaked whale, whereas a partial overlapping of the habitat of the other two species was observed for sperm whale. Such a partitioning of the upper and lower slope area may be the result of the common feeding habits and suggests a possible competition of these three species. A temporal segregation in the use of the slope area was also observed for sperm whales and Risso's dolphins. Fin whales, and the occasionally encountered common dolphin and long-finned pilot whales showed a generic preference for the pelagic area. In contrast, striped dolphins were generically found in any type of physical habitat, in agreement with their known opportunistic feeding habits. Interannual and seasonal movements were observed in fin whales and in all the other regularly occurring species, indicating that changes in the environmental and climatological conditions have a remarkable influence on habitat use. Finally, a relationship between group size and habitat use was observed for the species known to forage in groups. This relationship suggests that these species respond to environmental variability either by moving within the study area or by behavioural changes that may reflect changes in the preference for prey items. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This population shows reduced neutral genetic variation in comparison to the North Pacific population and thus might also display limited adaptive polymorphism. We sampled 36 fin whales from the GOC and assessed genetic variation at exon 2 of the major histocompatibility complex class II DQB-1 genes responsible for eliciting immune responses. Three divergent alleles were found with higher nonsynonymous than synonymous substitution rates within the peptide-binding region positions as well as the likely retention of ancient alleles, indicating that positive selection has shaped diversity in this species. Limited levels of nonneutral polymorphism, in addition to previously described low levels of neutral polymorphism, are consistent with the results of previous studies on vertebrate populations that have remained small and demographically stable for a very long time. Such low genetic variation in the GOC fin whales could be explained by 2 demographic scenarios: an ancient isolated population with limited gene flow or a more recent founder event after the last glacial maximum with very restricted gene flow. © The American Genetic Association. 2007.

With the main goal of gathering information on a feeding ground of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) that winter in Brazilian waters, we conducted an expedition to South Georgia. We present here the information regarding cetacean sightings during the expedition. From 28 January to 2 March, 2006 we carried out 13 research cruises, covering 700 nautical miles and 110 h of observation. We registered 10 sightings, in 7 h of ad libitum observations, of the following species: Megaptera novaeangliae, Eubalaena australis, Balaenoptera physalus, Mesoplodon layardii, Orcinus orca and Lagenorhynchus cruciger.

Fin whales, and other rorquals (Balaenopteridae), lunge with their mouth fully agape, thereby generating dynamic pressure to stretch their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water, which is then filtered by racks of baleen. Despite their large body size, fin whales appear to be limited to short dive durations, likely because of the energetic cost associated with large accelerations of the body during several lunges at depth. Here, we incorporate kinematic data from high-resolution digital tags and morphological data of the engulfment apparatus in a simple mechanical model to estimate the drag acting on a lunge-feeding fin whale. This model also allowed us to quantify the amount of water and prey obtained in a single lunge. Our analysis suggests that the reconfiguration and expansion of the buccal cavity enables an adult fin whale to engulf approximately 60 to 82 m3 of water, a volume greater than its entire body. This large engulfment capacity, however, comes at a high cost because the drag, work against drag, and drag coefficient dramatically increase over the course of a lunge. As a result, kinetic energy is rapidly dissipated from the body, and each subsequent lunge requires acceleration from rest. Despite this high cost, living balaenopterids are not only among the largest animals on earth, but are relatively speciose and exhibit diverse prey preferences. Given this ecological diversity, we frame our results in an evolutionary context, and address the implications of our results for the origin of lunge feeding. © Inter-Research 2007.","Balaenoptera physalus; Drag; Fin whale; Foraging; Locomotion; Lunge feeding","body size; drag; feeding; foraging behavior; locomotion; modeling; prey preference; quantitative analysis; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J Exp Biol, 205, pp. 1747-1753; Ahlborn, B.K., (2004) Zoological physics, , 2nd edn.

The source levels of blue and fin whale calls off the Western Antarctic Peninsula were calculated using recordings made with calibrated, bottom-moored hydrophones. Blue whales were located up to a range of 200 km using hyperbolic localization and time difference of arrival. The distance to fin whales, estimated using multipath arrivals of their calls, was up to 56 km. The error in range measurements was 3.8 km using hyperbolic localization, and 3.4 km using multipath arrivals. Both species produced high-intensity calls; the average blue whale call source level was 189±3 dB re:1 μPa - 1 m over 25-29 Hz, and the average fin whale call source level was 189±4 dB re:1 μPa - 1 m over 15-28 Hz. Blue and fin whale populations in the Southern Ocean have remained at low numbers for decades since they became protected; using source level and detection range from passive acoustic recordings can help in calculating the relative density of calling whales. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Audio recordings; Fish; Frequency estimation; Hydrophones; Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales; Hyperbolic localization; Passive acoustic recordings; Bioelectric potentials; acoustics; analytic method; animal communication; animal experiment; article; Balaenoptera musculus; balaenoptera physalus; controlled study; feeding; frequency analysis; mating; nonhuman; priority journal; sea; sound; sound detection; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Animals, Wild; Antarctic Regions; Balaenoptera; Fin Whale; Models, Biological; Population Density; Seawater; Sound Localization; Species Specificity; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"OPP 05-23349, OPP 99-10007","This work was supported by National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Grants OPP 99-10007 and OPP 05-23349 as part of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program, with program guidance by Polly Penhale, Roberta Martinelli, and Marie Bundy.

Attention is drawn to the decrease in longevity with size and the differences in biological parameters that reflect this and affect life history strategy and energy utilization. Data from the past whaling industry in Iceland for fin whales, the Faroese 'grindedrap' for pilot whales, and by-catches as well as some live captive studies for harbour porpoise have been used. The studies demonstrate how information can be gathered to compile energy budgets for individuals, relying on carcase measurement and analysis, dietary investigations, biochemical analyses of tissues, and general life history studies including reproduction; as well as from monitoring living animals. The individual examples presented show how food energy storage in the form of fat can be variously important in insulation in the smallest species to controlling reproductive efficiency in large migratory species. The paper concludes by noting that an understanding of energy use in the individual can be an important input in multi-species ecosystem modelling.",,"bioenergetics; cetacean; diet; ecosystem modeling; energy budget; fat reserve; insulation; life history; longevity; porpoise; reproduction; whale; Arctic; Iceland; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Globicephala melas; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Acquarone, M., (2004) Body composition, field metabolic rate and feeding ecology of walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) in northeast Greenland, , PhD thesis, National Environmental Research Institution, Roskilde, Denmark; Aarefjord, H., Bjørge, A.J., Kinze, C.C. & Lindstedt, I., 1995.

The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales.

Some geographic areas are potentially more threatened than others: one of these is the Mediterranean Sea. Levels of some xenobiotics are much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this paper we review the final results of a project supported by the Italian Ministry of the Environment, in which the hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDCs was investigated. We illustrate the need to develop and apply sensitive methodological tools, such as biomarkers (Vitellogenin, Zona Radiata proteins and CYP1A activities) for evaluation of toxicological risk in large pelagic fish top predators (Swordfish, (Xiphias gladius), Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus thynnus)) and nondestructive biomarkers (CYP1A activities and fibroblast cell culture in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened marine mammals species (Striped Dolphin, (Stenella coeruleoalba), Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus))exposed to EDCs. Differential gender susceptibility to EDCs is also explored both in large pelagic fish and in cetaceans. In cetaceans, male specimens showed higher cytochrome P450 induction (BPMO in skyn biopsies, CYP2B in fibroblasts cell cultures) by xenobiotics with respect to females. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J4P 1T3, Canada","Understanding the factors influencing habitat selection is critical to improving management and conservation plans for large whales. Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies. Identification of surface fronts from satellite imagery thus effectively complemented field observations of whales. These findings significantly increase our understanding of habitat quality in rorqual whales, and encourage a greater use of dynamic environmental variables in future studies of whale habitat use. © Inter-Research 2007.","Blue whale; Finback whale; Gulf of St. Lawrence; Habitat selection; Humpback whale; Minke whale; Sea surface temperature; Thermal fronts","environmental factor; feeding behavior; feeding mechanism; habitat selection; oceanic front; population distribution; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; temperature effect; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Benson, S.R., Croll, D.A., Marinovic, B.B., Chavez, F.P., Harvey, J.T., Changes in the cetacean assemblage of a coastal upwelling ecosystem during El Nino 1997-98 and La Nina 1999 (2002) Prog Oceanogr, 54, pp. 279-291; Bjørge, A., How persistent are marine mammal habitats in an ocean of variability?

Box 22085, Valencia 46071, Spain","Evidence about the diet and the type of association, commensalistic or parasitic, of species of Balaenophilus is not conclusive. In this study, we addressed these questions based on patterns of microhabitat selection, SEM and immunohistochemistry analyses of gut contents of the two species in the genus, B. unisetus and B. umigamecolus. We also made histopathological descriptions of the sites where the latter species occurred. Heavy infections of B. unisetus were found on the baleen plates of 18 out of 20 fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, captured off the NW coast of Spain. Gut contents were packed as food pellets that were composed mostly of baleen tissue, as indicated by both SEM and immunohistochemistry. Individuals of B. umigamecolus appeared in 43 out of 52 loggerhead sea turtles from the Western Mediterranean. In six turtles analysed in detail, copepods occurred mostly in the hinge region between limb scales and on the skin of the cloacal region; rarely under whitish skin lesions on the neck and hindlimbs. No food pellets could be found in 20 individuals examined, but two of them had pieces of tissue in the mouth that resembled turtle skin. The histopathologic analysis was also compatible with mild host reaction to the erosion of epidermis produced by B. umigamecolus. The occurrence of Balaenophilus spp. as ectoparasites of phylogenetically unrelated hosts which, however, provide similar keratin-rich habitats, might suggest that the exploitation of this food resource (an ecological novelty among crustaceans) is in the origin of these associations. This hypothesis is further supported by the record of another putative species of Balaenophilus on the skin of sirenians. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",,"crustacean; diet; ectoparasite; histopathology; host use; host-parasite interaction; microhabitat; protein; skin; stomach content; whale; Eurasia; Europe; Mediterranean Coast [Spain]; Southern Europe; Spain; Balaenophilus; Balaenophilus unisetus; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Caretta; Copepoda; Crustacea; Harpacticoida; Sirenia; Testudines",,,,,,"Acknowledgments We thank G.

Age estimates were based on the racemization of L-aspartic acid to D-aspartic acid in the nucleus of the eye lens. The ratio of D- and L-enantiomers was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The aspartic acid racemization rate (kAsp) was estimated to be 0.001045/year ± 0.000069 SE by regression of D/L ratios on age estimated by length from 15 young narwhals (≤298 cm) and by earplug laminations from 13 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). The D/L ratio at age 0 ((D/L)0) was estimated to be 0.0288 by regression of D/L ratios against the estimated age of the 15 young narwhals. The intercept of the regression slope, providing twice the (D/L)0 value, was 0.05759 ± 0.00147 SE. The maximum estimated age was a 115-year-old (±10 SE) female. Asymptotic body length was estimated to be 396 cm for females and 457 cm for males, and asymptotic body mass was estimated to be 904 kg for females and 1,645 kg for males. Using the von Bertalanffy growth model, age at sexual maturity was estimated to be 6-7 years for females and 9 years for males. © 2007 American Society of Mammalogists.","Age estimation; Aspartic acid racemization; Monodon monoceros; Narwhal","age determination; aspartic acid; estimation method; eye; growth; growth modeling; longevity; racemization; whale; Arctic; Greenland; West Greenland; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Monodon; Monodon monoceros",,,,,,,"ADAMS, J.

From February 2001 to February 2004, thirty similar transects were conducted monthly, using the same dedicated boat and a consistent sampling protocol, including visual observation and passive acoustic sampling. A total effort of 5759 km was sampled, conducted at the same speed and in good sighting conditions. Relative abundances of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were determined using standard line-transect methodology. The relative abundance of striped dolphins peaked in May and September (&gt;1.3×10-2 ind.km-1), while a consistent minimum value (&lt;0.6×10-2 ind.km-1) was obtained from December to April. A maximum relative abundance of fin whales occurred in August with 5.6×10-2 ind.km-1 and decreased to almost zero from November to January. For sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), a long diver species, frequency and abundance indices were determined using acoustic sampling. The highest acoustic relative abundance was observed from August to October, with more than 2×10-2 ind.km-1. Environmental parameters (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll) were computed for the sampling area from remote sensing imagery and pooled on a monthly basis, to correlate with relative abundance indices of the three species. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"chlorophyll; dolphin; line transect; monitoring; relative abundance; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; whale; Corse; Eurasia; Europe; France; Italy; Liguria; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; Western Europe; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Raga, J.A., The striped dolphin epizootic in the Mediterranean Sea (1993) Ambio, 22, pp. 524-528; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling: Estimating abundance of biological populations, , New York: Oxford University Press; Clark, C.W., Borsani, J.F., Notarbartolo di Sciara, G., Vocal activity of fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, in the Ligurian Sea (2002) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 286-295; Drouot, V., Gannier, A., Goold, J.C., Summer social distribution of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in the Mediterranean Sea (2004) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 84, pp. 675-680; Drouot, V., Gannier, A., Goold, J.C., Diving and feeding behavior of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea (2004) Aquatic Mammals, 30, pp. 419-426; Forcada, J., Hammond, P.S., Geographical variation in abundance of striped and common dolphins of the western Mediterranean (1998) Journal of Sea Research, 39, pp. 313-325; Forcada, J., Notarbartolo di Sciara, G., Fabbri, F., Abundance of fin whales and striped dolphins summering in the Corso-Ligurian Basin (1995) Mammalia, 59, pp. 127-140; Forcada, J., Aguilar, A., Hammond, P.S., Pastor, X., Aguilar, R., Distribution and abundance of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Western Mediterranean during summer (1996) Journal of Zoology, 238, pp. 23-34; Gannier, A., Estimation de l'abondance estivale du Rorqual commun Balaenoptera physalus (Linné, 1758) dans le bassin Liguro-Provençal (Méditerranée nord-occidentale) (1997) Revue d'Ecologie (Terre et Vie), 52, pp. 69-86; Gannier, A., Une estimation de l'abondance estivale du Dauphin bleu et blanc Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833) dans le futur Sanctuaire Marin International de Méditerranée nord-occidentale (1998) Revue d'Ecologie (Terre et Vie), 53, pp. 255-272; Gannier, A., Les cétacés de Méditerrané e: Nouveaux résultats sur leur distribution, la structure de leur peuplement et l'abondance relative des différentes espèces (1999) Mésogée, 56, pp. 3-19; Gannier, A., Drouot, V., Goold, J.C., Distribution and relative abundance of sperm whales in Mediterranean Sea (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 243, pp. 281-293; Goffart, A., Hecq, J.H., Prieur, L., Contrôle du phytoplancton du bassin Ligure par le front Liguro-Provençal (secteur Corse) (1995) Oceanologica Acta, 18, pp. 329-342; Gomez de Segura, A., Crespo, E.A., Pedraza, S.N., Hammond, P., Raga, J.A., Abundance of small cetaceans in waters of the central Spanish Mediterranean (2006) Marine Biology, 150, pp. 149-160; Gordon, J.C.D., Matthews, J.N., Panigada, S., Gannier, A., Borsani, F.J., Notarbartolo di Sciara, G., Distribution and relative abundance of striped dolphins, and distribution of sperm whales in the Ligurian Sea cetacean sanctuary (2000) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2, pp. 27-36; Goujon, M., Forcada, J., Desportes, G., Fin whale abundance in the eastern north Atlantic, estimated from French program MICA-93 data (1994) 8th Annual Conference of the European Cetacean Society, pp. 81-83; Laran, S., 2005.

A single observer recorded the positions, species, numbers and surface activity of whales encountered during boat tours. We controlled for biased search effort by calculating sightings rates for both species in cells measuring 2′ latitude by 2′ longitude throughout the study area. Sightings rates were calculated by dividing the number of sightings of fin and minke whales in each cell by the number of visits by the tour boat to that cell. We used generalized additive models and generalized linear models to examine the influence of benthic topography on whale distribution patterns. Models showed a non-linear relationship for minke whale sighting rates with increasing benthic slopes and a linear relationship for minke and fin whale sightings rates with increasing water depth. Sightings of minkes were concentrated in areas subject to tidal wakes near the northern tips of Grand Manan and Campobello Island. Fin whales were also found off the northern tip of Grand Manan but sighting rates for this species were highest in areas with less benthic sloping topography adjacent to the relatively deep Owen Basin. Foraging was recorded during 87% of all whale encounters and our results indicate that whale distribution in this area is likely to be influenced by depth, bottom topography and fine scale oceanographic features that facilitate foraging. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"benthos; foraging behavior; habitat fragmentation; habitat structure; population distribution; topography; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Australasia; Australia; Bay of Fundy; Bowen Basin; Campobello Island; Canada; Grand Manan Archipelago; New Brunswick; North America; Queensland; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , ed.

The objective was to collect sightings data for all cetacean species encountered to begin to collate information for a large-scale sightings database. Two observers employed standard-distance sampling techniques and visual observations (naked eye) to scan for cetaceans during daylight hours and favourable weather conditions. Approximately 112 h were spent surveying over 23 d. A total of 13 cetacean species were encountered, with 173 separate sightings recorded, totalling over 2000 animals. The most commonly sighted species were minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata: N=44), Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus: N=34, with group sizes of up to 600), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae: N=31). The distribution of minke whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins and fin whales was linked to underlying oceanographic variables. Overall patterns of distribution were consistent with our understanding of the summer distributions for the species encountered. The survey highlighted the cetacean diversity of the northern North Atlantic region. Repeat work using this methodology will allow an examination of species' distributions and estimation of their relative abundance. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"abundance; cetacean; data acquisition; monitoring; passenger ship; population distribution; species diversity; surveying; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Dietz, R., Teilmann, J., Heide-Jorgensen, M., Jensen, M.K., Satellite tracking of humpback whales in West Greenland (2002) NERI Technical Report, , No. 411, National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark; Evans, P.G.H., Hammond, P.S., Monitoring cetaceans in European waters (2004) Mammal Review, 34, pp. 131-156; Kapel, F.O. & F.

This research presents sounds recorded in the presence of Sei whales near the Hawaiian Islands in November, 2002. A total of 107 vocalizations, including two variations of low-frequency downswept calls, were measured. Two of these calls were sweeps from 100 Hz to 44 Hz, over 1.0 seconds. The second call type (n=105) consisted of low- frequency calls which swept from 39 Hz to 21 Hz over 1.3 seconds. These calls are different from sounds attributed to Sei whales in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, where recordings were made only in the summer months. These sounds are similar, however, to sounds attributed to fin whales in Hawaiian waters.

Whereas brain structure has been documented in detail in some odontocetes, few reports exist on its organization in mysticetes. We studied the cerebral cortex of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in comparison to another balaenopterid, the fin whale, and representative odontocetes. We observed several differences between Megaptera and odontocetes, such as a highly clustered organization of layer II over the occipital and inferotemporal neocortex, whereas such pattern is restricted to the ventral insula in odontocetes. A striking observation in Megaptera was the presence in layer V of the anterior cingulate, anterior insular, and frontopolar cortices of large spindle cells, similar in morphology and distribution to those described in hominids, suggesting a case of parallel evolution. They were also observed in the fin whale and the largest odontocetes, but not in species with smaller brains or body size. The hippocampal formation, unremarkable in odontocetes, is further diminutive in Megaptera, contrasting with terrestrial mammals. As in odontocetes, clear cytoarchitectural patterns exist in the neocortex of Megaptera, making it possible to define many cortical domains. These observations demonstrate that Megaptera differs from Odontoceti in certain aspects of cortical cytoarchitecture and may provide a neuromorphologic basis for functional and behavioral differences between the suborders as well as a reflection of their divergent evolution. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Balaenopterids; Cetaceans; Cytoarchitecture; Dolphins; Mysticete; Neocortex; Odontocete","animal tissue; article; Balaenoptera; brain cortex; brain region; Cetacea; controlled study; echolocation; female; humpback whale; mammal; Megaptera novaeangliae; nonhuman; priority journal; spindle cell; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Dolphins; Evolution; Female; Fin Whale; Humpback Whale; Male; Neocortex; Neurons; Porpoises; Pyramidal Cells; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Hominidae; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti",,,,,,,"Allman, J.M., Watson, K.K., Tetreault, N.A., Hakeem, A.Y., Intuition and autism: A possible role for Von Economo neurons (2005) Trends Cogn Sci, 9, pp. 367-373; Baldauf, Z., SMI-32 parcellates the visual cortical areas of the marmoset (2005) Neurosci Lett, 383, pp. 109-114; Barnes LG, Domming DP, Ray CE. 1985.

These compounds were found in Atlantic white sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) and a potential food source (Loligo pealei) with concentrations as high as 2.7 μg/g (lipid weight). The regiospecificity of C9H3N2Br6Cl is suggestive of a biogenic origin. Debromination of C9H3N2Br6Cl may be significant in the formation of C9H4N2Br5Cl. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (B. acutorostrata) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and 6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 159, Gloucester, MA 01930, United States","This paper reviews and analyzes ship collision records for the relatively isolated population of fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea from 1972 to 2001. Out of 287 carcasses, 46 individuals (16.0%) were certainly killed by boats. The minimum mean annual fatal collision rate increased from 1 to 1.7 whales/year from the 1970s to the 1990s. Fatal strike events (82.2%) were reported in or adjacent to the Pelagos Sanctuary, characterized by high levels of traffic and whale concentrations. Among 383 photo-identified whales, 9 (2.4%) had marks that were attributed to a ship impact. The reported rates are unusually high for baleen whales. The high likelihood of unreported fatal strikes combined with other anthropogenic threats suggests an urgent need for a comprehensive, basin-wide conservation strategy, including ship strike mitigation requirements, like real-time monitoring of whale presence and distribution to re-locate ferry routes to areas of lower cetacean density, and reducing ship speed in high cetacean density areas. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we examine the evolutionary history of this group by comparing genealogies derived from Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA sequences. We generated topologies based on paternally and maternally inherited characters for males from nine baleen whale species, including representatives of three families (Balaenidae, Eschrichtiidae, and Balaenopteridae) and four genera (Balaena, Eschrichtius, Balaenoptera, and Megaptera). Divergence among species was fifteen times greater for mtDNA than for Y-specific DNA. Both mtDNA and yDNA topologies revealed the family Balaenopteridae to be paraphyletic, but this relationship was neither strongly supported nor consistent across phylogenetic analysis methodologies. Humpback and fin whales, representing different genera, were reciprocally monophyletic sister species according to mtDNA. Although the monophyly of fin whales decayed for yDNA, a close relationship between fin and humpback whales was retained in yDNA trees. The paraphyly of fin whales and the long branch leading to humpback whales for the yDNA marker may suggest life history differences between these species. Specifically, male humpback whales showed higher than average divergence from other baleen whales at yDNA, although not at mtDNA, suggesting a potential for smaller effective population sizes among male humpbacks on an evolutionary timescale. The observation that those species that have been found to hybridize in nature (blue/fin and blue/humpback) do not reveal evidence for paraphyly for either maternal or paternal markers suggests that introgressive hybridization has not historically been extensive and thus may not represent a substantial source of phylogenetic error for Mysticeti. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The data presented were collected by the Tethys Research Institute during summers of 1990-1999 during a long-term study on the habitat use and preferences of fin whales in this area, described as their major feeding ground in the Mediterranean. Data on the presence, distribution, habitat use, and diving behaviour are reviewed. The data presented here emphasize the crucial role that the pelagic portion of the western Ligurian Sea plays in the ecology of Mediterranean fin whales and provide impetus for the expeditious implementation of conservation and management measures in the area.","Balaenoptera physalus; Diving behaviour; Fin whale; Habitat use; Mediterranean Sea; MPA","diving behavior; feeding ground; habitat use; marine mammal; population distribution; whale; Mediterranean Sea; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Duguy, R., Les mammifères marins de la Méditerranée occidentale (1990) Bull.

In spite of this, reliable information on their ecology and distribution is limited to the north-western part of the basin. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that Mediterranean fin whales comprise a separate population with very limited gene flow with their North Atlantic co-specifics. Although both published and anecdotal information reports their presence in the south central Mediterranean during winter, there is no information on habitat use. In February 2004, a 14-day boat survey was carried out in the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa, where fin whales occur at this time of the year. A total of 20 fin whale groups (average group size two animals) were encountered. In each encounter the animals were engaged in surface feeding activity. From plankton samples and underwater video, the prey species was identified as the Euphausiid, Nyctiphanes couchi. The information obtained suggests that this area may be an important winter feeding ground for fin whales. The results represent significant new information on fin whale ecology in the Mediterranean, with associated conservation and management implications.",,"conservation management; feeding ground; gene flow; genetic analysis; island; marine ecosystem; prey availability; survey; whale; winter; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Euphausiidae; Nyctiphanes couchi",,,,,,,"(2002) Proceedings of the First Session of the Meeting of the Parties of the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area, , Monaco, 28 February-2 March; Best, P.B., Distribution and feeding habits of baleen off the cape Province (1967) Division of Fisheries, Investigational Report, South Africa, 57, pp. 1-44; Bowen, W.D., Siniff, D.B., Distribution, population biology and feeding ecology of marine mammals (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 423-484. , ed.

As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with <1 % of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models. © Inter-Research 2006.","Distribution; GIS; Global; Habitat suitability modeling; Marine mammals; Niche model; Relative environmental suitability","cetacean; environmental modeling; habitat use; mapping; marine ecosystem; pinniped; population distribution; range expansion; taxonomy; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Angel, M.V., Long-term, large-scale patterns in marine pelagic systems (1992) Proceedings of the 34th Symposium of the British Ecological Society with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, pp. 377-402. , Giller PS, Hildrew AG, Raffaelli DG (eds) Aquatic ecology: scale, pattern and process.

Man-made Endocrine Disruptors (EDs) range across all continents and oceans. Some geographic areas are potentially more threatened than others: one of these is the Mediterranean Sea. Levels of some xenobiotics are much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this paper we review the final results of a project in which the hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDs was investigated. Methods. In a four-year survey on the Mediterranean population of swordfish (Xiphias gladius), the potential toxicological effects of organochlorine compounds (OCs) on specimens of swordfish and tuna fish (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), caught in the spawning seasons from 1999 to 2002 in the Straits of Messina, Sicily (Italy), were investigated using vitellogenin (Vtg), Zona radiata proteins (Zrp), and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activities (EROD, BPMO). Tissues (skin and blubber) were obtained from Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus from the western Ligurian Sea, between Corsica and the French-Italian coast, and Ionic Sea using biopsy darts launched with a crossbow. Benzo(α)pyrene monoxigenase (BPMO) activity was mesured in biopsies and cholrinated hydrocarbon levels were detected. Results and Discussion. We illustrate the need to develop and apply sensitive methodological tools, such as biomarkers (Vitellogenin, Zona Radiata proteins and CYP1A activities) for evaluation of toxicological risk in Xiphias gladius and Thunnus thynnus thynnus), and nondestructive biomarkers (CYP1A activities and fibroblast cell culture in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened marine mammals species (Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus) exposed to EDs. Conclusion. The present research shows that: a) Vtg and Zrp can be used as diagnostic tools for fish stocks hazard assessment in the Mediterranean Sea; b) that CYP1A1 (BPMO) induction in cetaceans skin biopsy may be an early sign of exposure to EDs such as OCs and a potential alert for transgenerational effects. Recommendation and Outlook. This research represents a warning signal of the potential reproductive alterations in marine top predators and suggest the need for continuous monitoring to avoid reductions in population and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Endocrine disruptors; Fibroblast cell culture; Marine mammals; Mediterranean Sea; Skin biopsy; Top predators; Vitellogenin; Xiphias gladius; Zona Radiata proteins","chlorinated hydrocarbon; cytochrome P450 1A1; egg protein; endocrine disruptor; unspecific monooxygenase; vitellogenin; zona radiata protein, fish; biodiversity; biomarker; chlorinated hydrocarbon; endocrine disruptor; marine mammal; organochlorine; pelagic fish; toxicity; xenobiotics; animal; animal disease; article; biopsy; blood; Cetacea; chemically induced disorder; female; fish disease; male; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; tuna; Animals; Benzopyrene Hydroxylase; Biopsy; Cetacea; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Egg Proteins; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Fish Diseases; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Male; Mediterranean Sea; Tuna; Vitellogenins; Eurasia; Europe; Ionian Sea; Italy; Ligurian Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Sicily; Southern Europe; Strait of Messina; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Scombridae gen. sp.; Stenella coeruleoalba; Thunnus thynnus thynnus; Tursiops truncatus; Xiphias gladius",,"unspecific monooxygenase, 9012-80-0, 9037-52-9, 9038-14-6; Benzopyrene Hydroxylase, 1.14.14.-; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1, 1.14.14.1; Egg Proteins; Endocrine Disruptors; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Vitellogenins; zona radiata protein, fish",,,,"Acknowledgements.

Although several phylogenetic hypotheses about these taxa have been proposed, their phylogenetic relationships remain confused. We addressed this problem using short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) insertion data, which now are regarded as almost ideal shared, derived characters at the molecular level. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of baleen whales by characterizing 36 informative SINE loci. One of the intriguing conclusions is that balaenopterids and eschrichtiids radiated very rapidly during a very short evolutionary period. During this period, speciation occurred in balaenopterids and eschrichtiids while newly inserted SINE loci remains polymorphic. Later on, these SINEs were sorted incompletely into each lineage. Thus, there are now inconsistencies among species regarding the presence or absence of a given SINE. This is in sharp contrast to the phylogeny of toothed whales, for which no SINE inconsistencies have been found. Furthermore, we found monophyletic groupings between humpback and fin whales as well as between (sei + Bryde's) whales and blue whales, both of which have not previously been recognized. The comprehensive SINE insertion data, together with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny that was recently completed (Sasaki, T., M. Nikaido, H. Healy et al. 2005.

Mean lipid content for the different body parts of DWCS samples ranged from 33 to 69% of the wet weight and triacylglycerols (TG) represented 80 to 86% of the total lipids; 36 FAs were observed in all blubber layers in greater than trace amounts (>0.2%). Multivariate correspondence analysis showed that the major variation in FAs structure was related to body position (dorsal versus ventral and lateral) and to a lesser extent to the blubber stratification. Dorsal blubber TG could be distinguished from the other locations by the relative levels of 20:0 and 20:1 FA, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were the main descriptors of the lateral and ventral blubber. Stratification resulted in a slight increase in monoenoic fatty acid (MUFA) content from the inner to the outer layers and a decreasing PUFA content. The 6 biopsies from living whales showed a similar FA composition and displayed FA profiles similar to those of the dorsal outer blubber blocks. Comparison of blubber FA structure with fin whales from the North Atlantic showed major differences, with a far lower percentage of 22:1 FA for the Mediterranean individuals and smaller differences in long chain MUFA between the inner and outer layer. Fin whales feed on the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica. Ligurian Sea M. norvegica appeared to have lower percentages of 20:1 and 22:1 FAs than their North Atlantic counterparts. Hence, the lower percentages of 20:1 and 22:1 FAs in the inner layer could reflect the structure of the prey assimilated. The slightly higher values in the outer layer could reflect the previous fall and winter feeding periods in Atlantic waters. The relative homogeneity of the blubber throughout the body suggested that sampling live animals to describe trophic interactions may be more realistic in the Mediterranean Sea than in the Atlantic. © Inter-Research 2006.","Balaenoptera physalus; Blubber; Fatty acid; Trophic interaction","fatty acid; stratification; trophic interaction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Euphausiidae; Meganyctiphanes norvegica",,,,,,,"Ackman, R.G., Application of flame ionization detectors to thin layer chromatography on coated quartz rods (1981) Methods Enzymol, 72, pp. 205-252; Ackman, R.G., Eaton, C.A., Lipids of the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) from North Atlantic waters.

Twenty-four species were seen on this survey, including two species (Fraser's dolphin [Lagenodelphis hosei] and sei whale [Balaenoptera borealis]) that had not been previously documented to occur in Hawaiian waters. The most abundant large whales are sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The most abundant delphinids are pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), Fraser's dolphins, spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and Kogia breviceps) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are also estimated to be quite abundant. Some of the migratory baleen whales (fin whales [Balaenoptera physalus], sei whales, minke whales [B. acutorostrata], and humpback whales [Megaptera novaeangliae]) were seen only late in the survey. Abundance is estimated for 19 cetacean species. The overall density of cetaceans is low in the study area, especially for delphinids. The precision of density and abundance estimates is generally low for all species because of the low number of sightings. © 2006 the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Abundance; Cetacean; Density; Dolphin; Hawai'i; Lagenodelphis hosei; Line-transect survey; Multiple covariates; Pacific; Whale","abundance; cetacean; population density; seasonal variation; Hawaiian Islands; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; dolphin (cetacean); Globicephala macrorhynchus; Kogia; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenodelphis hosei; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella coeruleoalba; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Ziphiidae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

These whales obtain their prey by lunge-feeding, an extraordinary biomechanical event where large amounts of water and prey are engulfed and filtered. This process entails a high energetic cost that effectively decreases dive duration and increases post-dive recovery time. To examine the body mechanics of fin whales during foraging dives we attached high-resolution digital tags, equipped with a hydrophone, a depth gauge and a dual-axis accelerometer, to the backs of surfacing fin whales in the Southern California Bight. Body pitch and roll were estimated by changes in static gravitational acceleration detected by orthogonal axes of the accelerometer, while higher frequency, smaller amplitude oscillations in the accelerometer signals were interpreted as bouts of active fluking. Instantaneous velocity of the whale was determined from the magnitude of turbulent flow noise measured by the hydrophone and confirmed by kinematic analysis. Fin whales employed gliding gaits during descent, executed a series of lunges at depth and ascended to the surface by steady fluking. Our examination of body kinematics at depth reveals variable lunge-feeding behavior in the context of distinct kinematic modes, which exhibit temporal coordination of rotational torques with translational accelerations. Maximum swimming speeds during lunges match previous estimates of the flow-induced pressure needed to completely expand the buccal cavity during feeding.","Balaenoptera physalus; Diving; Fin whale; Kinematics; Lunge-feeding; Swimming","acceleration; animal; article; biomechanics; diving; feeding behavior; fin whale; physiology; Acceleration; Animals; Biomechanics; Diving; Feeding Behavior; Fin Whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J.

However, characterizing spatial distribution of wild animals such as fin whales is a major priority to protect these populations and to study their interactions with their environment. We have associated a geostatistical model with the Poisson distribution to model both spatial variation and discrete observation process. Assuming few weak hypotheses on the distribution of abundance, we have improved the experimental variogram estimate using weights that are derived from expected variances and proposed a bias correction that accounts for the variability added by the Poisson observation process. In the same way the kriging system was modified to interpolate directly the theoretical underlying animal abundance better than noisy observations from count data. For cumulative count data of fin whales over the summers 1993-2001, the method gave a map of the relative abundance which is informative on the spatial patterns. Kriging interpolation variances were dramatically reduced - ratio from 0.015 to 0.26 - compared to usual Ordinary Kriging on raw data. Adding the hypothesis of stationarity over time the variogram estimated on cumulative data can be then used with more sparser annual data. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

From a total effort of 1613 km, 93 sightings were obtained for eight species: striped dolphin (55 sightings), fin whale (25 sightings), sperm whale, Risso's dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, Cuvier's beaked whale, long-finned pilot whale and bottlenose dolphin. Cetaceans were observed, depending on their usual distribution pattern, in four regions of the sanctuary: the Northeast, Central, Southwest and Tyrrhrenian sectors. Density estimates were 0.52 individuals/km2 (Stenella coeruleoalba) and 0.097 individuals/km2 (Balaenoptera physalus), with respective abundances of 37,526 (CV=26.2%) and 715 individuals (CV=31.2%). Striped dolphins and fin whales were more abundant in the central region, when the diversity was higher in the Tyrrhenian region, with sighting rates of 0.5 individuals/100 km for the sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale, 4.8 and 7.3 individuals/100 km for Risso's dolphin and the common dolphin, respectively. Abundance estimates are in agreement with those previously obtained in 1991, 1992, and 1996, considering the differences in geographical limits. Statistical testing showed that such surveys might detect abundance changes of 7-10% if carried out regularly. © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.","Abundance; Cetaceans; Diversity; Mediterranean; Transect survey","abundance estimation; dolphin; population density; population distribution; population estimation; species diversity; summer; transect; whale; Mediterranean Sea; Pelagos Sanctuary; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella coeruleoalba; Tursiops; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A. et J.A.

Sequential megafaunal collapse in the North Pacific Ocean: an ongoing legacy of industrial whaling? Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 100 (21), 12,223-12,228] hypothesized that great whales were an important prey resource for killer whales, and that the removal of fin and sperm whales by commercial whaling in the region of the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) in the late 1960s and 1970s led to cascading trophic interactions that caused the sequential decline of populations of harbor seal, northern fur seal, Steller sea lion and northern sea otter. This hypothesis, referred to as the Sequential Megafaunal Collapse (SMC), has stirred considerable interest because of its implication for ecosystem-based management. The SMC has the following assumptions: (1) fin whales and sperm whales were important as prey species in the Bering Sea; (2) the biomass of all large whale species (i.e., North Pacific right, fin, humpback, gray, sperm, minke and bowhead whales) was in decline in the Bering Sea in the 1960s and early 1970s; and (3) pinniped declines in the 1970s and 1980s were sequential. We concluded that the available data are not consistent with the first two assumptions of the SMC. Statistical tests of the timing of the declines do not support the assumption that pinniped declines were sequential. We propose two alternative hypotheses for the declines that are more consistent with the available data. While it is plausible, from energetic arguments, for predation by killer whales to have been an important factor in the declines of one or more of the three populations of pinnipeds and the sea otter population in the BSAI region over the last 30 years, we hypothesize that the declines in pinniped populations in the BSAI can best be understood by invoking a multiple factor hypothesis that includes both bottom-up forcing (as indicated by evidence of nutritional stress in the western Steller sea lion population) and top-down forcing (e.g., predation by killer whales, mortality incidental to commercial fishing, directed harvests). Our second hypothesis is a modification of the top-down forcing mechanism (i.e., killer whale predation on one or more of the pinniped populations and the sea otter population is mediated via the recovery of the eastern North Pacific population of the gray whale). We remain skeptical about the proposed link between commercial whaling on fin and sperm whales, which ended in the mid-1960s, and the observed decline of populations of northern fur seal, harbor seal, and Steller sea lion some 15 years later. © 2006.","Harbor seal; Killer whale; Northern fur seal; Population declines; Predator-prey; Steller sea lion","Biodiversity; Oceanography; Seals; Harbor seal; Killer whale; National Academy of Sciences; Northern fur seal; Population declines; Predator-prey; Sequential Megafaunal Collapse (SMC); Steller sea lion; Ecosystems; biomass; harbor; nutritional status; pinniped; trophic interaction; whale; whaling; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Bering Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Carnivora; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Enhydra lutris; Enhydra lutris kenyoni; Eschrichtius robustus; Eumetopias jubatus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phoca vitulina; Physeteridae; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Benson, A.J., Trites, A.W., Ecological effects of regime shifts in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific Ocean (2003) Fish and Fisheries, 3, pp. 95-113; Braham, H.W., Everitt, R.D., Rugh, D.J., Northern sea lion population decline in the eastern Aleutian Islands (1980) Journal of Wildlife Management, 44, pp. 25-33; Calkins, D.G., Becker, E.F., Pitcher, K.W., Reduced body size of female Steller sea lions from a declining population in the Gulf of Alaska (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14 (2), pp. 232-244; Eberhardt, L.L., Breiwick, J., Impact of recent population data on historical population levels of bowhead whales inferred from simulation studies (1992) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 42, pp. 485-489; Eberhardt, L.L., DeMaster, D.P., Sease, J., Projecting the trend of Steller sea lion populations in western Alaska (2005) Marine Mammal Science, 21 (4), pp. 728-738; Estes, J.A., Tinker, M.T., Williams, T.M., Doak, D.F., Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems (1998) Science, 282, pp. 473-476; Fritz, L.W., Ferrero, R.C., Berg, R.J., The threatened status of Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, under the Endangered Species Act: effects on Alaska groundfish management (1995) Marine Fisheries Review, 57 (2), pp. 14-27; Fritz, L.W., Hinckley, S., A critical review of the regime shift- junk food - nutritional stress hypothesis for the decline of the western stock of Steller sea lion (2005) Marine Mammal Science, 21, pp. 476-518; Frost, K.J., Lowry, L.F., Ver Hoef, J.M., Monitoring the trend of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill (1999) Marine Mammal Science, 15, pp. 494-506; Hobbs, R.C., Rugh, D.J., Waite, J.M., Breiwick, J.M., DeMaster, D.P., Abundance of eastern North Pacific gray whales on the 1995/96 southbound migration (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6 (2), pp. 115-120; Holmes, E.E., York, A.E., Using age structure to detect impacts on threatened populations: a case study with Steller sea lions (2003) Conservation Biology, 17 (6), pp. 1794-1806; Hoover-Miller, A.A., (1994) Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) biology and management in Alaska, , Marine Mammal Commission, Washington, D.C 45 pp; International Whaling Commission, Report of the Scientific Committee (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6, pp. 211-217; Kenyon, K.W., Rice, D.W., Abundance and distribution of the Steller sea lion (1961) Journal of Mammalogy, 42, pp. 223-234; Loughlin, T., Rugh, D., Fiscus, C., Northern sea lion distribution and abundance: 1956-1980 (1984) Journal of Wildlife Management, 48, pp. 729-740; Loughlin, T.R., Perlov, A.S., Vladimirov, V.A., Range wide survey and estimate of total number of Steller sea lions in 1989 (1992) Marine Mammal Science, 8, pp. 220-239; Loughlin, T.R., York, A.E., An accounting of the sources of Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, mortality (2000) Marine Fisheries Review, 62 (4), pp. 40-45; Matkin, C.O., Barrett-Lennard, L., Ellis, G., Killer whales and predation on Steller sea lions (2002) Steller sea lion decline: Is it food II, , DeMaster D., and Atkinson S.

In total, 508 hours of survey effort were completed, with 304.2 hours in Beaufort sea-state 3 or less. Two hundred and thirty one sightings of eight species - common dolphin Delphinus delphis (L.), Atlantic white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus (Gray), bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (Montagu), harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena (L.), Risso's dolphin Grampus griseus (Cuvier), pilot whale Globicephala melas (Traill), minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata (Lacepede) and fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (L.) - were recorded, totalling 2,933 individuals. The greatest diversity and relative abundance were recorded on the Rockall Bank where Atlantic white-sided dolphin was the most abundant species. The common dolphin was the most abundant species recorded on the continental shelf to the south-west of Ireland, while the relative abundance of cetaceans off the north coast was very low. The data suggest that cetacean species composition and relative abundance can vary greatly between adjacent marine habitat types and over relatively small geographical distances. © Royal Irish Academy.",,"Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Berrow, S., Biological diversity of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) in Irish waters (2001) Marine Biodiversity in Ireland and Adjacent Waters, pp. 115-119. , J.

The primary goal of the study was to examine blue whale seasonally and song type as part of a larger worldwide study. Calls were recorded from blue whales of two song types, fin whales, humpback whales, Bryde's whales, and of two unknown call types, each probably produced by Bryde's whales. The peak of calling density was May through September for the blue, fin, and humpback whales. The known Bryde's whale calls occurred year-round and the probable Bryde's whale calls occurred from May through December. Blue whale songs of a type so far known only from New Zealand waters were detected within 2 km of shore and occurred four times from June to December, whereas the Southern Ocean blue whale songs were detected only further offshore in mid-winter. Bryde's whale calls were the most abundant type and often occurred near the hydrophones. These data provide a baseline from which future recordings from the same hydrophones could be compared. © 2006, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Balaenoptera; Cetacean; Hydrophone; New Zealand;

Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.","Atlantic White-sided Dolphin; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Fin Whale; Harbour Porpoise; Humpback Whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; Minke Whale; Phocoena phocoena; White-beaked Dolphin","abundance; dolphin; porpoise; prey availability; research vessel; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; whale; Canada; Halifax; North America; Nova Scotia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Edited by W.

However, these data can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries, which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9 650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Generalized additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates. Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists. The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95% CI: 978-3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 (95% CI: 1 326-15 179) and minke whales was 1,544 (95% CI: 1,221-1,953). These estimates agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.

Very little, however, is known about how the physical forcing within these features affects their behaviour at a fine scale. During the summers of 2000 and 2002, we combined a series of cliff-top observations and boat-based surveys to describe the movements of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus and minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata within a predictable island wake occurring near Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. We recorded the location of fin and minke whales as they surfaced in or near the wake. We also examined the movements of individual fin whales using focal follow techniques to assess their habitat use within 3 distinct oceanographic regions (non-wake habitat, eddy habitat and free stream habitat) of the study area. Fin and minke whale occurrence was highest during flood tides and lowest during the mid-ebb phases. Fin (33) and minke whale (64) sightings were concentrated in areas characterised by slower current velocities - the region influenced by the eddy system formed within the wake. Nine individual fin whales, identified through photographs, spent a disproportionate amount of time within the eddy habitat portion of the study area, with occasional forays into free stream habitat. Foraging in the high-vorticity regions of the wake likely allows whales to exploit higher prey concentrations than in the free stream habitat or non-wake habitat. © Inter-Research 2005.","Behaviour; Fin whale; Foraging; Island wake; Minke whale; Oceanography","eddy; foraging behavior; habitat use; island; vorticity; wake; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Canada; Grand Manan Archipelago; New Brunswick; North America; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo, A., Behaviour and movements of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in the entrance to Ensenada de la Paz, Mexico (1991) Aquat Mamm, 17, pp. 137-147; Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J Exp Biol, 205, pp. 1747-1753; Agler, B.A., Schooley, R.L., Frohock, S.E., Katona, S.K., Seipt, I.E., Reproduction of photographically identified fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, from the Gulf of Maine (1993) J Mamm, 74, pp. 577-587; Aguilar, A., Fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, pp. 435-438. , Perrin WF, Wursig B, Thewissen JGM (eds) Academic Press, San Diego CA; Alldredge, A.L., Hamner, W.M., Recurring aggregation of zooplankton by a tidal current (1980) Estuar Coast Mar Sci, 10, pp. 31-37; Alldredge, J.R., Ratti, J.T., Comparison of some statistical techniques for analysis of resource selection (1986) J Wildl Manag, 50, pp. 157-165; Allen, M.C., Read, A.J., Gaudet, J., Sayigh, L.S., Fine-scale habitat selection of foraging bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus near Clearwater, Florida (2001) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 222, pp. 253-264; Barkley, R.A., Johnston Atoll's wake (1972) J Mar Res, 30, pp. 201-216; Braune, B.M., Gaskin, D.E., Feeding ecology of nonbreeding populations of larids off Deer-Island New-Brunswick Canada (1982) Auk, 99, pp. 67-76; Brodie, P.F., Sameoto, D.D., Sheldon, R.W., Population densities of euphausiids off Nova-Scotia as indicated by net sample whale stomach contents and sonar (1978) Limnol Oceanogr, 23, pp. 1264-1267; Croll, D.A., Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Tershy, B.R., Urban-Ramirez, J., The diving behavior of blue and fin whales: Is dive duration shorter than expected based on oxygen stores?

They had been dispatched by the Norwegian whaling company Hvalfangeraktienselskapet Rosshavet, which had obtained a licence from the British government. For most of the 1923-24 season, Sir James Clark Ross occupied an uneasy anchorage in the deep waters of Discovery Inlet, a narrow embayment in the front of the Ross Ice Shelf, while her catchers pursued whales widely in the Ross Sea. During that first season they killed and processed 221 whales (211 blue whales and 10 fin whales), which yielded 17,300 barrels of oil. During the next decade, with the exception of the 1931-32 season, Sir James Clark Ross and two other factory ships operated by Rosshavet, C.A. Larsen and Sir James Clark Ross II, operated in the Ross Sea. From the 1926-27 season onwards these ships were joined by up to three other factory ships and their catchers, operated by other companies. During the decade 1923-33 the Rosshavet ships killed and processed 9122 whales in the Ross Sea sector, mainly in the open waters of the Ross Sea south of the pack-ice belt. Total harvest for all factory ships from the Ross Sea sector for the period was 18,238 whales (mainly blue whales) producing 1,490,948 barrels of oil. From 1924 onwards the Rosshavet catchers wintered in Paterson Inlet on Stewart Island, New Zealand, and from 1925 onwards a well-equipped shipyard, Kaipipi Shipyard, operated on Price Peninsula in Paterson Inlet to service the Rosshavet ships. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",,"historical geography; hunting; twentieth century; whaling; oceanic regions; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; World; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Amundsen, R., (1912) The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the 'Fram' 1910-1912, 2. , London: John Murray; Basberg, B.L., Naevestad, D., Hvalfangstminneregistrering på Syd Georgia - Vurdering av landstasjonenes tilstand og vreneverdi (1990) Norsk Polarinstitutt Meddelelser, 110; Bickel, L., (2000) Shackleton's Forgotten Men: The Untold Tragedy of the Endurance Epic, , New York: Thunder's Mouth Press and Balliett & Fitzgerald; Byrd, R.E., (1930) Little America: Aerial Exploration in the Antarctic: The Flight to the South Pole, , New York: Putnam's Sons; Cumpston, J.S., (1968) Macquarie Island, , Melbourne: Antarctic Division, Department of External Affairs; Dawbin, W.H., Whales and whaling in the Southern Ocean (1952) The Antarctic Today, pp. 151-194. , Simpson, FA.

Although several phylogenetic hypotheses about these taxa have been proposed, their phylogenetic relationships still remain confusing. SINE (short interspersed repetitive element) insertion data are now regarded as almost ideal shared derived characters at the molecular level, and we have applied this method to this problem. Here, we successfully reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of these whales by characterizing 40 informative SINE loci. One of the intriguing conclusions is that balaenopterids and eschrichtiids radiated very rapidly during a very short evolutionary period. During this period, when newly inserted SINE loci retained ancestral polymorphisms, speciation occurred and these SINEs were sorted incompletely into each lineage, thus resulting in inconsistencies regarding the presence or absence of the SINE. This is in sharp contrast to the phylogeny of toothed whales, for which no SINE inconsistencies have been found. Furthermore, we found monophyletic groupings between humpback and fin whales, and also between (sei + Bryde's) and blue whales, both of which have not previously been recognized. The comprehensive SINE insertion data, together with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny that was recently completed, provide a nearly complete picture of the evolutionary history of baleen whales.","Ancestral polymorphisms; Baleen whale; Phylogenetic tree; Radiation; SINE method","cetacean; evolution; phylogenetics; whale; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Eschrichtiidae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Adachi, J., Hasegawa, M., Phylogeny of whales: Dependence of the inference on species sampling (1995) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 12, pp. 177-179; Amason, U., Gretarsdottir, S., Widegren, B., Mysticete (baleen whale) relationships based upon the sequence of the common cetacean DNA satellite (1992) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 9, pp. 1018-1028; Adegoke, J.A., Amason, U., Widegren, B., Sequence organization and evolution, in all extant whalebone whales, of a DNA satellite with terminal chromosome localization (1993) Chromosoma, 102, pp. 382-388; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species (1993) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 10, pp. 960-970; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationship of baleen whales established by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Cytochrome b nucleotide sequences and the identification of five primary lineages of extant cetaceans (1996) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 13, pp. 407-417; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and world-wide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proceeding of National Academy of Science, 90, pp. 8239-8243. , (14 co-authors), USA; Barnes, L.G., McLeod, S.A., The fossil record and phyletic relationships of gray whales (1984) The Gray Whale, Eschrichtius Robustus, pp. 3-32. , M.

Distributions of four large whale species: fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), minke (B. acutorostrata) and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) aligned with proposed metapopulation breaks in diet and population trend of SSLs. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) were widely distributed throughout the study area, and killer whales were particularly prevalent along the north Aleutian Island coastlines between Unimak Pass and Samalga Pass. Biopsies determined that most killer whales (92%) were of the piscivorous (resident) ecotype as opposed to the mammal-eating (transient) ecotype observed in 2002 only. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore relationships between these multispecies patterns in distribution, oceanographic variables (salinity, temperature, fluorescence and depth) and proximity to six Aleutian passes. The GAMs indicated the best-fit models and most significant correlations as determined by the Akaike function and Cp-statistics were: depth and proximity to the nearest measured pass for SSLs and all cetaceans, respectively; frequencies of herring and salmon in SSL diet with population trend; fluorescence in the top 50 m with occurrence of humpback, minke, and killer whales; and surface temperature with occurrence of humpback, killer, and sperm whales. Results of the GAM analyses suggest foci for future investigation of relationships between physical variables and interspecific patterns of marine mammal distribution. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biophysical; Cetacean; Generalized additive models; Killer whales; Metapopulation; Orca; Steller sea lion","diet; pinniped; population distribution; population dynamics; diet; ecotype; interspecific interaction; metapopulation; pinniped; piscivore; population decline; survey; whale; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; North America; United States; Alaska; Alaska Peninsula; Aleutian Islands; North America; United States; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Delphinidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Delphinidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Is It Food?

However, during primate and artiodactyl evolution episodes of rapid change occurred, so that the GHs of higher primates and ruminants differ markedly from those of other mammals. To extend knowledge of GH evolution in Cetartiodactyla (Artiodactyla plus Cetacea) we have previously characterized GH genes from several members of this group, including the common dolphin. Surprisingly the sequence deduced for dolphin GH differed at several residues from that described previously for another cetacean, finback whale. To investigate this anomaly we have now cloned and characterized the GH gene from finback whale. The overall organization of this gene is similar to that of dolphin, and the deduced amino acid sequence of finback whale GH differs from that of dolphin GH at only residue 47, and from that of pig GH at only residue 149. Phylogenetic analysis of the data provides further support for inclusion of Cetacea within the order Cetartiodactyla, as sister group of Hippopotamidae. The results support the idea that in Cetartiodactyla a burst of rapid evolution of GH occurred after the separation of the line leading to ruminants from other cetartiodactyls. Overall, the GH gene in cetaceans appears to be evolving more slowly than in most other cetartiodactyls. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Fishery observer coverage was 19% over the period (3,369 days observed/17,649 days fished). An experiment to test the effectiveness of acoustic pingers on reducing marine mammal entanglements in this fishery began in 1996 and resulted in statistically significant reductions in marine mammal bycatch. The most commonly entangled marine mammal species were the short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis; California sea lion, Zalophus californianus; and northern right whale dolphin, Lissodelphis borealis. Estimated mortality by species (CV and observed mortality in parentheses) from 1996 to 2002 is 861 (0.11, 133) short-beaked common dolphins; 553 (0.16,103) California sea lions; 151 (0.25, 31) northern right whale dolphins; 150 (0.21, 27) northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris; 54 (0.41, 10) long-beaked common dolphins, Delphinus capensis; 44 (0.53, 6) Dall's porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli; 19 (0.60, 5) Risso's dolphins, Grampus griseus; 11 (0.71, 2) gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus; 7 (0.83, 2) sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus; 7 (0.96, 1) short-finned pilot whales, Globicephala macrorhychus; 12 (1.06, 1) minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata; 5 (1.05, 1)fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus; 11 (0.68, 2) unidentified pinnipeds; 33 (0.52, 4) leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea; 18 (0.57, 3) loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta; 13 (0.73, 3) northern fulmars, Fulmarus glacialis; and 6 (0.86, 2) unidentified birds.",,"acoustic survey; bycatch; fishing mortality; gillnet; marine mammal; seabird; turtle; California; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Alopias vulpinus; Aves; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Caretta caretta; Cetacea; Cheloniidae; Chondrichthyes; Coryphaenidae; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Dermochelyidae; Dermochelys coriacea; dolphin (whale); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Fulmarus glacialis; Globicephala; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Grampus griseus; Lissodelphis borealis; Mammalia; Mirounga angustirostris; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Pinnipedia; Testudines; Xiphias gladius; Zalophus; Zalophus californianus",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., DeMaster, D.P., Differentiating Serious and Non-serious Injury of Marine Mammals Taken Incidental to Commercial Fishing Operations: Report of the Serious Injury Workshop 1-2 April 1997, Silver Spring, MD (1998), p. 48. , U.S. Dep.

Automatic detection and acoustic power analysis methods were used for determining presence and absence of whale calls. Blue whale calls were detected year round, on average 177 days per year, with peak calling in March and April, and a secondary peak in October and November. Lowest calling rates occurred between June and September, and in December. Fin whale calling rates were seasonal with calls detected between February and June (on average 51 days/year), and peak calling in May. Sea ice formed a month later and retreated a month earlier in 2001 than in 2002 over all recording sites. During the entire deployment period, detected calls of both species of whales showed negative correlation with sea ice concentrations at all sites, suggesting an absence of blue and fin whales in areas covered with sea ice. A conservative density estimate of calling whales from the acoustic data yields 0.43 calling blue whales per 1000 n mi 2 and 1.30 calling fin whales per 1000 n mi 2, which is about one-third higher than the density of blue whales and approximately equal to the density of fin whales estimated from the visual surveys. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, their presence in shelf systems is a good indicator of productive food webs. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans conducted during the late 1990s in the SE Bering Sea (160.32 to 171.08° W) indicate that the middle shelf (50 m &lt; z &lt; 100 m) now supports the highest whale biomass in this region. In recent decades, whales were rare and hence their ecological role on the shelf was limited. During July 1997, the density and abundance (N) of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were highest on the middle shelf between 163.7 and 168.1° W: 0.0236 humpback whales km -2, N = 1308 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.65), and 0.00924 fin whales km-2, N = 513 (CV = 0.61), respectively. Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1° W): 0.0169 fin whales km-2, N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79 % of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170° W (0.77 × 106 mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.","Bering Sea; Carbon; Cetaceans; Coccolithophore; Ecosystem changes; Whales","carbon;

Satellite imagery was used to gain knowledge on primary biomass over large time and space scales and to process environmental variables of significance to the problem of fin whale distribution. Fin whale distribution was obtained from survey data and expressed into sightings per unit of effort. Net primary production (g C/m2/day), NPP, can be estimated with a model by processing remote-sensed measurements of chlorophyll concentration, provided by SeaWIFS DAAC. NPP was integrated over different temporal scales, related to primary production cycles in the area. Additional variables were derived from sea surface temperature (AVHRR/NOAA sensors). Multiple cross-correlation coefficients were calculated between these environmental parameters and the fin whale summer distribution from 1998 to 2002. A predictive model, the potential grouping index, was developed from this statistical approach. This study improves our understanding of the variability of fin whale distribution in summer. While food availability at a particular time and place is a function of environmental conditions in the previous months, this study provides evidence that whales adapt their movements and group size directly to food availability rather than to instantaneous environmental conditions. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

During 111 trips, a total track length of 8128 km and estimated area of approximately 9840 km2 was surveyed, including both inshore and offshore waters. The most frequently sighted species were common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Taking account of biases in the survey data, the former species was most commonly sighted in deeper offshore waters (&gt;200 m depth) with the highest sightings rate in the second quarter of the year. Bottlenose dolphins were seen mainly in inshore waters to the south of Galicia but also in offshore waters further north. Sightings rates were higher when the observers' boats were engaged in fishing than when travelling. Published dietary data suggest that this may simply indicate that dolphins tend to congregate in fishing areas where their main prey occur. Several different treatments of the data were used to derive relative abundance indices (taking account of observation biases and of spatial variation in survey coverage). These calculations suggest that there may be around 7000-10,000 common dolphins and 600-1000 bottlenose dolphins in Galician waters, although dedicated surveys are needed to produce robust estimates. Other species seen during surveys included the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). Incidental observations from boats and land-based surveys supported the high relative abundance of common dolphins and, in inshore waters, of bottlenose dolphins, as well as providing additional records of porpoises and Risso's dolphins.",,"cetacean; geographical distribution; species occurrence; Eurasia; Europe; Galicia; Southern Europe; Spain; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Mammalia; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Tursiops truncatus; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., (1997) Inventario de Los Cetáceos de Las Aguas Atlánticas Peninsulares: Aplicación de la Directiva 92/43/CEE, , Memoria Final.

Here we present a modification of an earlier method developed by Nielsen and Wakeley (2001), which accommodates a finite-site mutation model, to assess which of the two models of divergence is most likely given the observed data. We apply the method to nucleotide sequence data collected from the variable part of the mitochondrial control region in fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from the Atlantic coast off Spain and the Mediterranean Sea. Our estimations strongly favor a model of recurrent gene flow over a model of recent divergence and zero gene flow. We estimated the migration rate at two females per generation. While the estimated rate is high by evolutionary standards, exchange rates of this order of magnitude is low from an ecological and conservation perspective and entirely consistent with the current paucity of fin whale sightings in the Strait of Gibraltar today. Intensive commercial shore-based whaling during the 1920s removed substantial numbers of fin whales in the Strait of Gibraltar and this local population has seemingly since failed to recover.","Cetacea; Divergence; Nonequilibrium; Reproductive isolation","divergence; gene flow; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Olmos, M., Lockyer, C.H., Sexual maturity in fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) caught off Spain (1988) Rep.

Dunant 3, Varese, I-21100, Italy","Organs and physiological internal systems of diving mammals display diverse and peculiar features. The kidney of cetaceans has been extensively studied and characterized. This organ is subdivided in small functional units called “renicules”; displaying a peculiar structure, the sporta perimedullaris musculosa. A comparative study of renicules was made in six species belonging to mysticetes and odontocetes. In all six species, the sporta, a connective tissue basket, was located between the medullary and the cortical regions of renicules. The sporta is mainly composed of a connective stroma and, in several species, the connective tissue (histochemically studied) was interposed among muscle fibres. Within the six studied species, the sporta varied in thickness, which appears to be related to the number, thickness and discontinuity of collagenous fibre bundles. The presence of smooth muscle fibres, evidenced by immunostaining and by electron microscopy analysis, was variable: whereas fibres were numerous in examined toothed whales (Stenella, Delphinus, Grampus, Tur-siops), they were practically absent in baleen whales such as the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus. The data in the present study shed light on the morpho-functional characterization of diving mammal anatomy and support the need to re-examine the general structure of cetacean phylogeny, in line with the hypothesis of Milinkovitch et al. (1994) and Hasegawa et al. (1997). © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cetacean; Renicule; Sporta perimidullaris mu-scolosa","cetacean; physiology; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinus; Grampus; Mammalia; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Tursiops",,,,,,,"Andersen, H.T., (1969) The biology of marine mammals., , New York: Academic Press; Cave, A.J.E., Aumonier, F.J., The visceral histology of the primitive cetacean Caperea (Neobalaena) (1961) J.

The presence of FOCs in top predators such as marine mammals would indicate a potential biomagnification of these compounds and their widespread occurrence. Liver and kidney tissues of nine marine mammal species have been sampled. Among all the measured FOCs compounds, PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) was predominant in terms of concentration. The highest PFOS concentrations were found in the liver of harbor seal compared to white-beaked dolphin, harbor porpoise, gray seal, sperm whale, white-sided dolphin, striped dolphin, fin whale, and hooded seal. PFOS concentrations differed significantly between sexes and age classes in harbor porpoises. Stable isotope measurements (δ13C and δ 15N) were used in this study to describe the behavior of contaminants in food webs. We found a significant (p &lt; 0.05) linear relationship between PFOS concentrations in livers of harbor porpoises and both muscle δ13C and δ15N measurements. Harbor and gray seals and white-beaked dolphin, which displayed the highest trophic position, contained the highest PFOS levels, while offshore feeders such as sperm whales, fin whales, striped dolphin, and white-sided dolphin showed lower PFOS concentrations than inshore species.",,"Biological organs; Carbon; Fluorocarbons; Impurities; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Organic chemicals; Biomagnification; Ocean engineering; carbon 13; isotope; nitrogen 15; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sea water; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; marine mammal; pollution exposure; stable isotope; article; dolphin; ecosystem; environmental exposure; food web; mammal; marine environment; nonhuman; oceanic regions; seal; water contamination; whale; Age Factors; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Biological Markers; Carbon Isotopes; Dolphins; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Food Chain; Male; Nitrogen Isotopes; North Sea; Seals, Earless; Seawater; Sex Factors; Tissue Distribution; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Whales; North Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Cystophora cristata; Halichoerus grypus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Mammalia; Phoca vitulina; Phocidae; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella coeruleoalba; Vertebrata",,"carbon 13, 14762-74-4; nitrogen 15, 14390-96-6; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Markers; Carbon Isotopes; Fluorocarbons; Nitrogen Isotopes; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, 1763-23-1; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,"Boon, J.P., Oostingh, I., Van Der Meer, J., Hillebrand, M.T.J., (1994) Eur.

Occasionally, offshore species such as the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus, the white-sided dolphin L. acutus and the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus are also found stranded. In order to trace their diet, we measured δ13C and δ15N in their muscles as well as in 49 invertebrate and fish species collected from the southern North Sea. The δ15N data indicate that the harbour seal, grey seal and white-beaked dolphin occupy the highest trophic position, along with ichtyophageous fishes such as the cod Gadus morhua (mean muscle values of 18.7, 17.9, 18.8 and 19.2‰ respectively). The harbour porpoise occupies a slightly lower trophic position (mean δ15N value of 16.2‰), reflecting a higher amount of zooplanktivorous fishes in its diet (mean δ15N of 14.7‰); 2 suckling harbour porpoises displayed a significant δ 15N enrichment of 2.2‰ compared to adult females. Adult females are δ15N-enriched compared to adult male harbour porpoises. Fin whales, sperm whales and white-sided dolphins are 13C-depleted compared to southern North Sea particulate organic matter and species, suggesting that despite regular sightings, they do not feed within the southern North Sea area.","Food web; Marine mammals; North Sea; Stable isotopes","diet; feeding ecology; marine mammal; stable isotope; trophic level; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Gadus; Gadus morhua; Gadus morhua; Grypus; Halichoerus grypus; Halichoerus grypus; Invertebrata; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Macrocephalus; Mammalia; Phoca; Phoca vitulina; Phoca vitulina; Phocidae; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae; Pisces; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Aarefjord, H., Bjørge, A.J., Kinze, C.C., Lindstedt, I., Diet of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in Scandinavian waters (1995) Rep Int Whal Comm Spec Iss, 16, pp. 211-222; Abend, A.G., Smith, T.D., Differences in ratios of stable isotopes of nitrogen in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in the western and eastern North Atlantic (1995) ICES J Mar Sci, 52, pp. 837-841; Abt, K.F., Hoyer, N., Koch, L., Adelung, D., The dynamic of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) off Amrum in the southeastern North Sea - Evidence of an open population (2002) J Sea Res, 47, pp. 55-67; Ben-David, M., McColl, C.J., Boonstra, R., Karels, T.J., 15N signatures do not reflect body condition in Arctic ground squirrels (1999) Can J Zool, 77, pp. 1373-1378; Bonner, N.W., The natural history of seals (1989) Mammal Series, , Neal E (ed) Billing & Sons, London; Boran, J.R., Evans, P.G.H., Reid, J.B., Northridge, S., Cetaceans in Northeast Atlantic waters: Using diverse sightings sources to monitor distribution and relative abundance (1998) Eur Res Cetaceans, 12, pp. 81-87; Bunn, S.E., Loneragan, N.R., Kempster, M.A., Effects of acid washing on stable isotope ratios of C and N in penaeid shrimp and seagrass: Implications for food-web studies using multiple stable isotopes (1995) Limnol Oceanogr, 40, pp. 622-625; Burns, J.M., Trumble, S.J., Castellini, M.A., Testa, J.W., The diet of Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica as determined from scat collections and stable isotopes analysis (1998) Polar Biol, 19, pp. 272-282; Camphuysen, C.J., Winter, C.J.N., Feeding fin whales Balaenoptera physalus in the North Sea (1995) Lutra, 38, pp. 81-84; Couperus, A.S., Interactions between Dutch midwater trawl and Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) southwest of Ireland (1997) J Northwest Atl Fish Sci, 22, pp. 209-218; Das, K., (2002) Trace Metal Contamination and Detoxication Processes in Marine Mammals from European Coasts, , PhD thesis, Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium; Das, K., Lepoint, G., Loizeau, V., Debacker, V., Dauby, P., Bouquegneau, J.M., Tuna and dolphin associations in the North-East Atlantic: Evidence of different ecological niches from stable isotope and heavy metal measurements (2000) Mar Pollut Bull, 40, pp. 102-109; Das, K., Beans, C., Holsbeek, L., Mauger, G., Berrow, S.D., Rogan, E., Bouquegneau, J.M., Marine mammals from northeast Atlantic: Evaluation of their trophic position by δ13C and δ15N and influence on their trace metal concentrations (2003) Mar Environ Res, 56, pp. 349-365; Dauby, P., Frankignoulle, M., Gobert, S., Bouquegneau, J.M., Distribution of POC, PON, and particulate Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ti, Zn and δ13C in the English Channel and adjacent areas (1994) Oceanol Acta, 17, pp. 643-657; Dauby, P., Khomsi, A., Bouquegneau, J.M., Trophic relationships within intertidal communities of the Brittany coasts: A stable carbon isotope analysis (1998) J Coast Res, 14, pp. 1202-1212; De Jong, F., Bakker, J.F., Van Berkel, C.J.M., Dankers, N.M.J.A., Dahl, K., Gätje, C., Marencic, H., Potel, P., (1999) Wadden Sea Quality Status Report.

The combination of the allozyme patterns and physical maturity of the eight specimens separated them from all acknowledged Balaenoptera species. In September 1998 we collected a medium-sized baleen whale carcass on a coastal island in the Sea of Japan. This specimen and the previously collected eight specimens resembled Balaenoptera physalus (fin whale) in external appearance but were much smaller. Comparison of external morphology, osteology and mitochondrial DNA data grouped the nine specimens as a single species but separated them from all known baleen whale species. Therefore, here we describe a new species of Balaenoptera, which is characterized by its unique cranial morphology, its small number of baleen plates, and by its distant molecular relationships with all of its congeners. Our analyses also separated Balaenoptera brydei (Bryde's whale) and Balaenoptera edeni (Eden's whale) into two distinct species, raising the number of known living Balaenoptera species to eight.",,"Biodiversity; DNA; Morphology; Osteology; Marine biology; alloenzyme; mitochondrial DNA; cetacean; new species; whale; article; balaenoptera brydei; balaenoptera edeni; balaenoptera omuri; female; male; morphology; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; skeleton; skull; species differentiation; whale; Animal Structures; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Isoenzymes; Japan; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Skull; Species Specificity; Whales; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera brydei; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Mysticeti","GENBANK: AB116095, AB116096, AB116097, AB116098, AB116099, M32181, M32182, M32183, M32184, M32185, M32186, M32187, M32188, M32189, M32190, M32505, M60408, X61145, X72006, X72195, X72199, X72204","Isoenzymes",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Acknowledgements This research was supported (M.E.M. and J.B.A.) by the NOAA-and NSF-supported ‘Earth Systems History’ programme and the NCAR-Early Career Scientist Assembly (C.M.A.).

Short distance video recording was also performed in two whales, permitting the simultaneous determination of single breath expiratory (TE) and inspiratory (TI) durations. In the 24 whales swimming at an average velocity of 1.39 (0.47) m·s-1 [mean (SD), range: 0.62-2.44 m·s-1], 2068 breaths organized in 477 respiratory cycles were observed. Each cycle entailed a prolonged apnoea dive phase [225 (91) s, Tdive) followed by a period near the surface [62 (28) s, surfacing], during which a series of breaths [4.6 (1.8)] was performed at short intervals. On the basis of track length and swimming velocity, two groups of animals were devised differing for convolution of the course (p&lt;0.001), extension of ranging territory (p&lt;0.01) and horizontal swimming velocity (p&lt;0.05), which may represent two distinct behaviours. A possibly general mechanism of control of breathing in cetaceans was found, consistent with a model of constant tidal volume and variable respiratory frequency. Coherently with this model,TE was independent of TI or Tdive, in line with a passive expiration, while TI appeared to be negatively correlated with Tdive (p &lt; 0.05), otherwise suggesting, similarly with terrestrial mammals, a significant role of hypercapnic stimulation. The estimated O2 consumption of about 150 1·min-1 is in line with the general allometric regression for mammals and corresponds to an energetic expenditure of 85-95 kJ·kg-1·day-1.","Mediterranean fin whale; Open sea tracking; Respiratory pattern","apnea; article; breathing; breathing mechanics; controlled study; correlation analysis; energy expenditure; expiratory flow; frequency analysis; hypercapnia; inspiratory capacity; locomotion; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; respiratory function; sea; swimming; tidal volume; velocity; videorecording; whale; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Diving; Energy Metabolism; Exhalation; Inhalation; Kinetics; Locomotion; Mediterranean Sea; Oxygen Consumption; Pulmonary Ventilation; Radar; Respiratory Mechanics; Swimming; Tidal Volume; Whales",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutiérrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J.

Baleen whales feed primarily on salty euphausiids (krill) and have no access to fresh water. How have these mammals adapted to lifelong habitation in a hyperosmotic medium? A new approach is proposed for studying this by using allometry (scaling) of endogenous creatinine clearance in mammals together with determinations of creatinine concentration in fresh postmortem blood and urine of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis). From the predicted mean creatinine-clearance values and the measured mean creatinine concentrations, a urine-production rates of 974 and 627 L/day for the fin and sei whales, respectively, were computed. Average daily krill ingestion of about 1300 and 835 L is predicted for the fin and sei whales, respectively. The whales seem to ingest about 30% more than earlier reported of a prey, which has about 50% of the salt concentration of seawater, thus maintaining the salt and water balance with a minimum of 1-2% seawater ingestion. The method used to estimate the above volumes could be a valuable tool in further studies of the water and salt balance of the large baleen whales, which may not have the same osmoregulatory control mechanisms as the smaller Odontoceti.",,"Blood; Seawater; Sodium chloride; Mammals; Ocean habitats; adaptation; food intake; osmoregulation; salt; urine; water; whale; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mammalia; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Adolph, E.F., Quantitative relations in the physiological constitutions of mammals (1949) Science (Wash., D.C.), 109, pp. 579-585; Altmann, P.L., Dittmer, D.S., (1968) Metabolism.

Particular attention has been given to the effect of carbon dioxide and lactate since the animal is specialised for prolonged dives often in cold water. The molecular basis of the functional behaviour and in particular of the weak interaction with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is discussed in the light of the primary structure and of computer modelling. On these bases, it is suggested that the A2 (Pro→Ala) substitution observed in the β chains of whale haemoglobin may be responsible for the displacement of the A helix known to be a key structural feature in haemoglobins that display an altered interaction with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate as compared with human haemoglobin. The functional and structural results, discussed in the light of a previous study on the haemoglobin from the Arctic whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata, give further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the interactive effects of temperature, carbon dioxide and lactate. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Passive tracking was performed with a new technique based on simultaneous determination of (1) position of the observation vessel, (2) laser-measured distance between the target animal and the observation vessel, and (3) azimuth of the target animal with respect to the observation vessel. Tracking was combined with timing of the surfacing intervals. Two different swimming-surfacing patterns supposed to be related to feeding and traveling, respectively, were observed. Supposed feeding whales reacted to disturbance by changing their behavior into traveling. Two different avoidance strategies were performed simultaneously by the whales: travel at increased velocity and reduction of the time spent at the surface. After the disturbance ceased, the surfacing activity never completely reverted to predisturbance conditions during one hour of postexposure control and supposed feeding behavior appeared to be suspended indefinitely. Our results suggest the need for whale watching regulations in the Ligurian Sea, particularly as far as presumed feeding whales are concerned.","Balaenoptera physalus; Behavior; Fin whale; Human-caused disturbance; Laser range-finder; Mediterranean; Passive tracking; Timing of respiration; Whale watching","behavioral response; boating; disturbance; respiration; swimming behavior; whale; Ligurian Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Albérola, C., Rousseau, S., Millot, C., Astraldi, M., Font, J., Garcìa-Lafuente, J., Gasparini, G., Vangriesheim, A., Tidal currents in the Western Mediterranean Sea (1995) Oceanologica Acta, 18, pp. 273-284; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., (1989) Behavioral Responses of Summering Humpback Whales to Vessel Traffic: Experimental and Opportunistic Observations, , Technical Report NPS-NR-TRS-89-01.

The ecology and status of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus in the Mediterranean Sea is reviewed. The species' presence, morphology, distribution, movements, population structure, ecology and behaviour in this semi-enclosed marine region are summarized, and the review is complemented with original, previously unpublished data. 2. Although the total size of the fin whale population in the Mediterranean is unknown, an estimate for a portion of the western basin, where most of the whales are known to live, was approximately 3500 individuals. High whale densities, comparable to those found in rich oceanic habitats, were found in well-defined areas of high productivity. Most whales concentrate in the Ligurian-Corsican-Provençal Basin, where their presence is particularly noticeable during summer; however, neither their movement patterns throughout the region nor their seasonal cycle are clear. 3. Based on genetic studies, fin whales from the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from North Atlantic conspecifics, and may constitute a resident population, separate from those of the North Atlantic, despite the species' historical presence in the Strait of Gibraltar. Fin whales are known to calve in the Mediterranean, with births peaking in November but occurring at lower rates throughout the year. They feed primarily on krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica which they capture by diving to depths in excess of 470 m. It is suggested that the extensive vertical migratory behaviour of its main prey may have influenced the social ecology of this population. 4. Known causes of mortality and threats, including collisions with vessels, entanglement in fishing gear, deliberate killing, disturbance, pollution and disease, are listed and discussed in view of the implementation of appropriate conservation measures to ensure the species' survival in the region.","Cetacean; Conservation; Marine mammal; Population size","conservation status; morphology; population ecology; population estimation; whale; Mediterranean Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Mammalia; Meganycthiphanes norvegica; Meganyctiphanes norvegica",,,,,,,"Affronte, M., Balenottere a frotte in Alto Adriatico (2000) Cetacea Informa, 9, pp. 9-12; Agler, B.A., Beard, J.A., Bowman, R.S., Corbett, H.D., Frohock, S.E., Hawermale, M.P., Katona, S.K., Seipt, I.E., Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) photographic identification: Methodology and preliminary results from the Western North Atlantic (1990) Individual Recognition of Cetaceans: Use of Photo-Identification and Other Techniques to Estimate Population Parameters, (12 SPEC.

Gadio 2, Milano, 20121, Italy","In the Mediterranean Sea, top predators, and particularly cetacean odontocetes, accumulate high concentrations of organochlorine contaminants and toxic metals, incurring high toxicological risk. In this paper we investigate the use of the skin biopsies as a non-lethal tool for evaluating toxicological hazard of organochlorines in Mediterranean cetaceans, presenting new data 10 years after the paper published by Fossi and co-workers [Mar. Poll. Bull. 24 (9) (1992) 459] in which this new methodology was first presented. Some organochlorine compounds, now with worldwide distribution, are known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here the unexplored hypothesis that Mediterranean cetaceans are potentially at risk due to organochlorines with endocrine disrupting capacity is investigated. High concentrations of DDT metabolites and PCB congeners (known as EDCs) were found in the different Mediterranean species (Stenella coeruleoalba, Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncatus and Balaenoptera physalus). In this paper we also propose benzo(a)pyrene monooxygenase (BPMO) activity in marine mammal skin biopsies (non-lethal biomarker) as a potential indicator of exposure to organochlorines, with special reference to the compounds with endocrine disrupting capacity. A statistically significant correlation was found between BPMO activity and organochlorine levels (DDTs, pp′DDT, op′DDT, PCBs and PCB99) in skin biopsies of males of B. physalus. Moreover a statistical correlation was also found between BPMO activity and DDT levels in skin biopsies of the endangered Mediterranean population of D. delphis. These results suggest that BPMO induction may be an early sign of exposure to organochlorine EDCs and can be used for periodic monitoring of Mediterranean marine mammal toxicological status. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research the unexplored hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDCs is investigated. In the Mediterranean environment, top predators accumulate high concentrations of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) and toxic metals, incurring high toxicological risk. Here we illustrate the need to develop sensitive biomarkers for evaluation of toxicological risk in top marine predators (Xiphias gladius, Thunnus thynnus thynnus) and non-lethal techniques, such as non-destructive biomarkers, for the hazard assessment of threatened species exposed to EDCs, such as marine mammals (Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus). © 2002 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.","Biomarkers; BPMO; Endocrine disruptors; Marine mammals; Mediterranean sea; Skin biopsy; Swordfish; Top predators; Vitellogenin; Zona Radiata proteins","Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Radiata; Stenella coeruleoalba; Thunnus thynnus thynnus; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus; Xiphias gladius",,,,,,,"Arcand-Hoy, L.D., Benson, W.H., Fish reproduction: an ecological relevant indicator of endocrine disruption (1998) Environ.

In the decades from 1800 to 1860, whaling effort consisted of a few localized, small-scale, shore-based enterprises on the coast of Maine and Cape Cod, Mass. Provincetown and Nantucket schooners occasionally conducted short cruises for humpback whales in New England waters. With the development of bomb-lance technology at mid century, the ease of killing humpback whales and fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, increased. As a result, by the 1870's there was considerable local interest at hunting rorquals (baleen whales in the family Balaenopteridae, which include the humpback and fin whales) in the Gulf of Maine. A few schooners were specially outfitted to take rorquals in the late 1870's and 1880's although their combined annual take was probably no more than a few tens of whales. Also in about 1880, fishing steamers began to be used to hunt whales in the Gulf of Maine. This steamer fishery grew to include about five vessels regularly engaged in whaling by the mid 1880's but dwindled to only one vessel by the end of the decade. Fin whales constituted at least half of the catch, which exceeded 100 animals in some years. In the late 1880's and thereafter, few whales were taken by whaling vessels in the Gulf of Maine.",,"fishery; historical record; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Gadus morhua; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Mem.

PFOS was detected in all of the wildlife species analyzed. Concentrations of PFOS in blood decreased in order of bottlenose dolphins &gt; bluefin tuna &gt; swordfish. Mean PFOS concentrations (61 ng/g, wet wt) in cormorant livers collected from Sardinia Island in the Mediterranean Sea were less than the concentrations of PFOA (95 ng/g, wet wt). PFOS concentrations in cormorant livers were significantly correlated with those of PFOA. FOSA was found in 14 of 19 livers or blood samples of marine mammals from the Mediterranean Sea. The highest concentration of 878 ng FOSA/g, wet wt, was found in the liver of a common dolphin. Livers of ringed and gray seals from the Bothnian Bay in the Baltic Sea contained PFOS concentrations ranging from 130 to 1100 ng/g, wet wt. No relationships between PFOS concentrations and ages of ringed or gray seals were observed. Concentrations of PFOS in livers of seals were 5.5-fold greater than those in corresponding blood. A significant positive correlation existed between the PFOS concentrations in liver and blood, which indicates that blood can be used for nonlethal monitoring of PFOS. Trend analysis of PFOS concentrations in livers of white-tailed sea eagles collected from eastern Germany and Poland since 1979 indicated an increase in concentrations during the 1990s. Livers of Atlantic salmons did not contain quantifiable concentrations of any of the fluorochemicals monitored.

Previous work by Bérubé and co-workers has shown that the degree of genetic diversity among fin whales in the Sea of Cortez at nuclear and mitochondrial loci is highly reduced. However, the relatively unobstructed connection with the North Pacific Ocean argues that Sea of Cortez fin whales are part of a much larger eastern North Pacific population given the extensive migratory ranges observed in fin whales and baleen whales in general. The low degree of genetic variation might thus simply be due to historic fluctuations in the effective population size of an eastern North Pacific population. In order to test if the reduced genetic variation detected among fin whales in the Sea of Cortez is due to small population size or a past bottleneck in an otherwise large eastern North Pacific population, we analyzed the geographic distribution of genetic variation at a single mitochondrial (control region) and 16 nuclear loci in samples collected from fin whales in the eastern North Pacific (n = 12) as well as the Sea of Cortez (n = 77). Our results showed that fin whales observed in the Sea of Cortez constitute a highly isolated and thus evolutionary unique population, which warrants special conservation measures given the current low estimate of abundance of approximately 400 individuals.","California; Conservation unit; Genetic divergence; Individual-based genealogy; Management; North Pacific","divergence; genetic variation; geographical distribution; whale; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,"Funding for the study was in part provided by the International Whaling Commission, US National Marine Comisión Nacional para el uso de la Biodiver-sidad (CONABIO), Fisheries and University of Wales Bangor.

G5H 3Z4, Canada","Capelin (Mallotus villosus) tridimensional distribution at the head of the Laurentian Channel in the St. Lawrence estuary was investigated using 38- and 120-kHz acoustic surveys in the summers of 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998. The results are interpreted with the help of a high-resolution tridimensional tidal circulation model. Total biomasses were small (93-4583 t) and showed rapid fluctuations, whereas mesoscale distribution was more constant. Capelin tended to occupy the very end of the channel head, especially the slopes and shallows surrounding the basins. This pattern did not coincide with the krill distribution, but the two total biomass series were significantly correlated. Capelin tidal dynamics is characterized by herding of capelin against the channel head slopes by the starting flooding currents, followed by an upwelling over the sills and shallows during maximum flood currents, and a return to the channel by the surface outflow during ebb. Each side of the channel head has a distinct capelin retention tidal cycle involving passive advection, swimming, and the two-layer estuarine circulation. This capelin distribution and tidal dynamics closely match the local fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) distributions observed from the whale-watching fleet and typical tidal feeding strategies at the channel head.",,"aggregation behavior; estuarine environment; spatial distribution; tidal cycle; upwelling; Canada; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mallotus villosus",,,,,,,"(2000) Etude socio-économique d'un secteur retenu pour l'identification d'une zone de protection marine pilote: Estuaire du Saint-Laurent, , Tecsult Environment Inc.

The dominant prey types of fin whales were euphausiids, with minor contributions from copepods and fish. Sei whale stomachs contained primarily copepods in three years, whereas euphausiids or a variety of fish dominated the diet in the other two years. Sperm whales consumed primarily North Pacific giant squid (Moroteuthis robusta), but secondary prey differed between males and females. Female sperm whales frequently consumed ragfish (Icosteus spp.) and other fish, whereas the male diet also contained rockfish (Sebastes spp.). The high abundance of euphausiids along the British Columbia coast likely contributed to the presence of a summer resident population of fin whales. The high abundance of large copepods farther north probably influenced the migration of sei whales through the offshore waters of British Columbia. Sperm whale stomach contents differed by sex reflecting location and possibly breeding behaviors.","Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; British Columbia; Diet; Fin whale; North Pacific; Physeter macrocephalus; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Stomach contents","diet; stomach content; whale; whaling; British Columbia; Canada; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cephalopoda; Cetacea; Copepoda; Icosteus; Icosteus; Icosteus aenigmaticus; Macrocephalus; Mammalia; Moroteuthis; Moroteuthis robusta; Moroteuthis robusta; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae; Sebastes; Sebastes; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Bowen, W.D., Siniff, D.B., Distribution, population biology, and feeding ecology of marine mammals (1999) Biology of marine mammals, pp. 423-484. , J.

The whale's location was determined using arrival-time differences of each call at the hydrophones. The recordings showed evidence of interference between signals propagating along direct and surface-reflected paths (the ""Lloyd Mirror""). We made preliminary estimates of source level (SL) using a spherical spreading model of transmission loss. We then applied a conservative correction for the effect of interference by subtracting the maximum possible signal enhancement from the preliminary SL estimate. These adjusted spherical spreading estimates had a median of 171 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m, with a range of 159-184 dB. These are the first SL estimates that explicitly attempt to correct for possible interference effects. We also propose a method that simultaneously estimates SL and source depth by fitting a Lloyd Mirror transmission loss curve to the measured received level, known receiver depth, and source-to-receiver range. Attempts to apply this method to the present data set yielded inconsistent results, probably because of the small number of hydrophones available. With more hydrophones in the interference field, this new method should produce reliable estimates of SL and depth of vocalizing whales.","Balaenoptera physalus; Dive depth; Fin whale; Lloyd Mirror; Sound; Source level; Vocalization","bioacoustics; vocalization; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Baggeroer, A.B., Kuperman, W.A., Schmidt, H., Matched field processing: Source localization in correlated noise as an optimum parameter estimation problem (1988) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 83, pp. 581-587; Baggeroer, A.B., Kuperman, W.A., Mikhalevsky, P.N., An overview of matched field methods in ocean acoustics (1993) IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering, 18, pp. 401-424; Cato, D.H., Simple methods of estimating source levels and locations of marine animals (1998) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 104, pp. 1667-1678; Charif, R.A., Mitchell, S.G., Clark, C.W., (1995) Canary 1.2 user's manual, , Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY; Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative analysis (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 1060-1071; Clark, C.W., Application of U.S. Navy underwater hydrophone arrays for scientific research on whales (1994) Scientific Report, International Whaling Commission, Annex M, pp. 1-12; Clark, C.W., Fristrup, K.M., Whales '95: A combined visual and acoustical survey of blue and fin whales off southern California (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 583-600; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Calibration and comparison of the acoustic location methods used during the spring migration of the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, off Pt.

The effective visual effort totalled 12,755 km in the course of 18 surveys during which 274 on-effort fin whale sightings were obtained. Fin whales showed preference for waters deeper than 2000 m (mean depth 2295 m) and for offshore waters, with a mean distance to shore of 45.3 km. A global mean sighting rate of 3.0 whales/100km was computed for the whole period of study, and successive survey sighting rates varied from lower values of 0.61-1.08 whale/100 km to higher values of 6.46-9.01 whales/100 km, suggesting inter-annual variability in large scale distribution. At medium scale, fin whales were shown to expand their distribution range from July to August, being more frequently found inshore of the 2000 m isobath late in summer. At small scale, the mean school size in successive years varied around the global average of 1.55 whales/sighting, but it was found consistently either low, medium or high during a given year, whenever surveys were available for both July and August. The present findings are consistent with existing knowledge on the ecology of the fin whale main prey, the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, particularly as far as distribution and reproductive cycle are concerned.",,"depth; habitat use; population distribution; summer; whale; Mediterranean Sea; Balaenoptera physalus; Meganycthiphanes norvegica",,,,,,,"Andersen, V., Sardou, J., Nival, P., The diel migrations and vertical distributions of zooplancton and micronecton in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. 1.

J0P 1H0, Canada","Reeves, R.R., Okapi Wildlife Associates, 27 Chandler Lane, Hudson, Que. J0P 1H0, Canada","The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes aboriginal subsistence whaling to be distinct from commercial whaling, and these two broad categories of whaling are subject to different management approaches. This paper describes recent, ongoing and likely future whale hunts that qualify, or may qualify, for aboriginal subsistence status within the IWC's management framework. To ensure conservation of the whale populations, a forthright exposition of the origins, development and character of these hunts is needed in addition to stock assessment, a risk-averse catch limit algorithm and appropriate mechanisms within the whaling communities to ensure compliance. The hunts for Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) and Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Arctic and North Pacific, respectively, and Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Indonesia have long histories and local origins. Those for Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Lesser Antilles and at Tonga in the South Pacific were introduced by foreign commercial whalers. Whale hunting in the Philippines appears to have originated both locally and as a result of foreign influence. The relatively recent initiation of whaling for Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland required introduced technology but can be viewed as a modern adaptation of an ancient tradition. Consensus in deciding how to classify and manage non-industrial whaling has been, and will remain, elusive. Even with common definitions of key terms such as 'subsistence', 'commercial' and 'aboriginal', interpretations will depend on whether one's priorities are whale-centred or human-centred.","Bowhead Whale; Bryde's Whale; Conservation; Fin Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Minke Whale; Sperm Whale; Whales; Whaling","commercial activity; conservation management; subsistence; whale; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribbean Studies, 11, pp. 55-74; Adams, J.E., Shore whaling in St Vincent Island, West Indies (1973) Caribbean Quarterly, 19, pp. 42-50; Adams, J.E., Primitive whaling in the West Indies (1975) Sea Frontiers, 21, pp. 303-313; Adams, J.E., Last of the Caribbean whalemen (1994) Natural History, 103 (11), pp. 64-71; Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Akimichi, T., Asquith, P.J., Befu, H., Bestor, T.C., Braund, S.R., Freeman, M.M.R., Hardacre, H., Takahashi, J., (1988) Small-Type Coastal Whaling in Japan.

The school dynamics and predation events of Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in a cold front area (about 125 km2) in the Norwegian Sea in April were quantified. Data from high-resolution sonar tracking of herring schools combined with echosounder data were integrated with pelagic-trawl samples. A total of 44 herring schools were each observed for an average of 34.8 min. Altogether, 184 behavioural events were recorded, with an event occurring every 8.3 min on average. Intra-school events (compression, reorganization, ring, pseudopodium, elongate, diving, surfacing) were observed every 15.3 min and inter-school events (approach, join, leave, split) every 22.9 min. We observed 17 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), six Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) and five killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the experimental area. Predator events occurred every 91 min on average. Of these marine mammals only fin whales swimming alone or in small groups (2-5 ind.) were observed to attack herring. Attacks from fin whales were observed every 170 min. They strongly influenced the density, shape and structure of the herring schools. Large fish such as cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens) preying on herring in coastal areas were not caught in the pelagic trawl or detected by acoustics. Herring schools were on average large (987 m2), dense, swam at depth (148 m) and had a moderate swimming speed (1.1 body lengths per second), reflecting a risk-averse, anti-predator behaviour to marine mammals. We discuss differences in schooling dynamics, anti-predator behaviour, attack frequency and predation risk between herring attacked by fin whales in an offshore area and herring attacked by gadoid predators closer to the coast in a similar study in May. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","Acoustics; Attack frequency; Fin whale; Herring dynamics; School tracking","acoustics; antipredator defense; predator-prey interaction; schooling behavior; whale; Norwegian Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Clupea; Clupea harengus; Clupea harengus; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Gadiformes; Gadus; Gadus morhua; Gadus morhua; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Mammalia; Orcinus orca; Orcinus orca; Pollachius; Pollachius virens; Pollachius virens",,,,,,,"Axelsen, B.E., Anker-Nilssen, T., Fossum, P., Kvamme, C., Nøttestad, L., Pretty patterns but a simple strategy: Predator-prey interactions between juvenile herring and Atlantic puffins observed with multibeam sonar (2001) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79, pp. 1586-1596; Blaxter, J.H.S., The herring: A successful species?

However, the knowledge about marine mammals, especially cetaceans, in these waters has been limited. The systematic investigation on marine mammals in the Turkish waters was started in 1987. In the Black Sea and Marmara Sea, three odontocete species, Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncatus, and Phocoena phocoena, are known to occur. Bycatch in the turbot fishery is the main threat for P. phocoena. In the Aegean and Mediteranean Sea, there are eight odontocete species: D. delphis, T. truncatus, Stenella coeruleoalba, Globicephala melas, Grampus griseus, Pseudorca crassidens, Physeter catodon, Ziphius cavirostris, and a single mysticete species, Balaenoptera physalus. Besides, our study confirmed that one of the critically endangered pinniped species, the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus, still survives in the Black Sea and Marmara Sea. It has fragmented populations in the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas and their status is critical due to loss of habitats and deliberate killing. © 2002, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Observers scanned for cetaceans with 25x (Big Eye) binoculars from the flying bridge (platform height = 12m) at survey speeds of 18.5-22 km h-1 (10-12 knots). Transect survey effort was 1761 km in 1999, in a study area 196,885 km2; and 2194 km in 2000, in a study area 158,561 km2. An additional 609 and 402 km of trackline was surveyed in 1999 and 2000, respectively, while in transit to or from pollock survey way points. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) the most common small cetacean in both regions. In the CEBS (1999), uncorrected cetacean abundance estimates were: 3368 (CV = 0.29) fin whales, 810 (CV = 0.36) minke whales (B. acutorostrata), 14,312 (CV = 0.26) Dall's porpoise and 693 (CV = 0.53) harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). In the SEBS (2000), uncorrected abundance estimates were: 683 (CV = 0.32) fin whales, 102 (CV = 0.50) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), 1003 (CV = 0.26) minke whales, 9807 (CV = 0.20) Dall's porpoise and 1958 (CV = 0.21) harbor porpoise. These are the first estimates of cetacean abundance that can be directly compared between two regions of the eastern Bering Sea. Distributions of some species were associated with bathymetric features, and there were occasions when prey associations were obvious. For example, in the SEBS, fin whales occurred on the Middle Shelf (50-100 m) and on the Outer Shelf (100-200 m) near the Pribilof canyon, but in the CEBS fin whales occurred primarily on the Outer Shelf along the 200 m isobath (i.e. the Green Belt). Fin whales were sometimes associated with echo-sounder backscatter from a mixture of fish schools and zooplankton. Humpback whales were also seen on the Middle Shelf, near the 50-m contour where the Inner Front often develops. Non-pollock echosigns observed near cetaceans, some of which may have been cetacean prey, were not routinely identified during trawl sampling because the research focus was on pollock abundance assessment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Deriving from the carcass of an immature beached whale, the bone was brought to Athens and was used probably as a cutting surface, before being discarded ca. 850 B.C. The context of this extraordinary artifact is analyzed and discussed, as are its possible functions. The occurrence of whales in the Aegean and Mediterranean is reviewed, so too the use of whales and whalebones in ancient Greece and in other cultures. Although the incidence of whalebone is rare in archaeological contexts in the Aegean, Classical literature is full of references to both fantastic sea monsters and real whales. The words that the Greeks and Romans used for whales and the language of whales in mythology and natural history reveal a rich and varied tradition. There is a similarly rich and long tradition of iconographic representations in ancient art, particularly of fabulous sea monsters, one that extends from Aegean prehistory into the Classical era and well beyond. The Agora whalebone provides a unique insight into the archaeology of whales and sea monsters in Greek literature, natural history, art, and material culture.",,,,,,,,,"Aharoni, J., Animals Hitherto Unknown to or Little Known from Palestine (1944) Bulletin of the Zoological Society of Egypt, 6, pp. 40-41. , SUPPL; (1986) The Social Life of Things, , Appadurai, A, ed, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ashe, G., (1962) Land to the West: St. Brendan's Voyage to America, , New York: Viking; Bauer, K., Cuvier's Schnabelwal Ziphius cavirostris Cuvier 1823 im östlichen Mittelmeer (1978) Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, 81, pp. 267-272; Beazley, J.D., (1947) Etruscan Vase-Painting, , Oxford: Clarendon; Bielefeld, E., Ein unteritalisches Vasenbild (1966) Pantheon, 24, pp. 252-255; Boardman, J., Very Like a Whale': Classical Sea Monsters (1987) Monsters and Demons in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: Papers Presented in Honor of Edith Porada, pp. 73-84. , edited by A.E.

Using the multiple logistic regression, sightings of cetaceans during the 1990-1996 summer (June-September) surveys were modeled with oceanographic (sea surface temperature, monthly probability of front occurrence) and topographic (depth, slope) variables for the same period. Predicted habitat maps for June and August were created for each species using a Geographical Information System. The predicted habitat locations matched with current and historic cetacean sighting locations. The model also predicted habitat shifts for some species associated with oceanographic changes. The correct classification rate of the prediction models with 1997-1998 summer survey data ranged from 44% to 70%, of which most of the misclassifications were caused by false positives (i.e., absence of sightings at locations where the models predicted).","Cetaceans; Geographical Information System; Habitat prediction model; Western North Atlantic Ocean","cetacean; GIS; model; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; (North); Atlantic Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Stenella (Cetacea); Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Au, D.W.K., Perryman, W.L., Dolphin habitats in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (1985) Fishery Bulletin, U.S., 83, pp. 623-644; Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Cetaceans of the western tropical Indian Ocean: Distribution, relative abundance, and comparisons with cetacean communities of two other tropical ecosystems (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14, pp. 429-459; Cayula, J.F., Cornillon, P.C., Multi-image edge detection for SST images (1995) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 12, pp. 821-829; (1982) A Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid- and North Atlantic Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, , Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, University of Rhode Island.

The eye-lens nucleus was dissected out and the relative amount of D- and L- enantiomers of aspartic acid measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A racemization reaction changes the D/L aspartic acid relationship in the nucleus over time. The age of each whale was estimated using the racemization rate for fin whales along with the measured D/L ratio. The minimum age estimated was 0 years, while the maximum was 32 years. The SE of the age estimates ranged from 4.5 to 8.7 years. Age at sexual maturity was estimated to 5.8 (±3.0) years by regressing the number of ovulations versus the age estimate. Using the von Bertalanffy growth model, age at sexual maturity was estimated to 7.8 (±6.0) years, and age at physical maturity to 13 years. These estimates are consistent with other demographic data for the species. No systematic errors in the age estimates were detected, but the racemization rate (2kASP) and initial ratio of D/L should be estimated specifically for minke whales to ensure accurate age estimates using this technique.","Age-determination; Aspartic acid; Minke whale; Racemization","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Andersen, L.W., Born, E.W., Dietz, R., Haug, T., Øien, N., Bendixen, C., (2000) Population structure of Greenland and NE Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) based on sequence variation of the D-loop of mtDNA and NDA microsatellite variation, , Paper SC/52/AS8 presented to the IWC scientific committee, May 2000. 16 p; International whaling commission report 1997-98 (1999) Annual Report of the International Whaling Commission, 51, pp. 1-3; Bada, J., Mitchel, E., Kemper, B., Aspartic acid racemization in narwhale teeth (1983) Nature, 303, pp. 418-420; Brodie, P., Paasche, A., Thermoregulation and energetics of fin and sei whales based on postmortem, stratified temperature measurements (1985) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 63, pp. 415-416; Christensen, I., Age determination of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, from laminated structures in the tympanic bulla (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 245-253; Donovan, G.P., A review of IWC stock boundaries (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 13, pp. 39-68; Fagerholm, P., Tengroth, B., Linsen (2000) Oftalmologi, pp. 159-172. , Høyding G., Bergen, Norway: Studia; George, J.C., Bada, J., Zeh, J., Scott, L., Brown, S.E., O'Hara, T., Suydam, R., Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) via aspartic acid racemization (1999) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 571-580; Jonsgård, Å., (1992) Den norske vågehvalfangsten, , Sandefjord, Norway.

We estimated the cost of lunge-feeding in both species using an approach that combined attaching time/depth recorders to seven blue whales and eight fin whales and comparing the collected dive information with predictions made by optimality models of dive behavior. We show that the rate at which whales recovered from a foraging dive was twice that of a non-foraging dive and that the cost of foraging relative to the cost of travel to and from the prey patch was 3.15 in blue whales (95 % CI 2.58-3.72) and 3.60 in fin whales (95% CI 2.35-4.85). Whales foraged in small areas (&lt;1 km2) and foraging bouts lasted more than one dive, indicating that prey did not disperse and thus that prey dispersal could not account for the limited dive durations of the whales. Despite the enormous size of blue whales and fin whales, the high energetic costs of lunge-feeding confine them to short durations of submergence and to areas with dense prey aggregations. As a corollary, because of their limited foraging time under water, these whales may be particularly vulnerable to perturbations in prey abundance.","Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Blue whale; Diving; Feeding costs; Fin whale; Foraging","Animal; Body Constitution; Comparative Study; Diving; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Models, Biological; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Whales; Animals; Body Constitution; Energy Metabolism; Models, Biological; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; animal; article; biological model; body constitution; comparative study; diving; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; histology; physiology; predation; species difference; whale",,,,,,,"Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine Mammals.

Blubber samples were collected from live specimens of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) by means of biopsies, a non-destructive biological method. Fin whales were sampled in the Ligurian Sea, whereas striped dolphins were collected in the Ligurian and the Ionian Seas. A fingerprint of 14 PAHs was obtained for both species. In whales, the median value of total PAHs was 1970 ppb fresh weight (f.w.) while median carcinogenic PAH values were 89.80 ppb f.w.; in dolphins, the median Values of total and carcinogenic PAHs were 29,500 and 676.00 ppb f.w., respectively. The different PAH values between the two species can be attributed to the different positions they take in the Mediterranean food web. The sampling period significantly influenced PAH concentrations of fin whales. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Balaenoptera physalus; Cetaceans; Mediterranean Sea; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Skin biopsy; Stenella coeruleoalba","aromatic hydrocarbon; carcinogen; cetacean; chemical pollutant; food web; PAH; animal tissue; article; bioaccumulation; Cetacea; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dolphin; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; sea pollution; skin biopsy; species difference; whale; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biopsy; Dolphins; Environmental Monitoring; Food Chain; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Tissue Distribution; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Whales; Mediterranean Sea; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Stenella coeruleoalba",,"Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,"Aguilar, A., Raga, J.A., The striped dolphin epizootic in the Mediterranean Sea (1993) Ambio, 22 (8), pp. 524-528; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Abnormally high polychlorinated biphenyl levels in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) affected by the 1990-1992 Mediterranean epizootic (1994) Sci.

Atlantic white-sided dolphin was the most abundant species in the region with a total of 6317 animals recorded. Harbour porpoise was the most frequently sighted cetacean species. The geographical distribution of sightings indicate that cetacean species have varying ecological requirements, with species such as sperm whale, pilot whale and white-sided dolphin favouring deep water off the continental shelf edge, while minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise were apparently limited to the continental shelf. The diversity of species recorded in the region suggests that the Atlantic Frontier is an important habitat for cetaceans. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Atlantic Frontier; Cetaceans; Continental shelf; Distribution; North-east Atlantic; Scotland; Surveys","biological survey; cetacean; geographical distribution; species diversity; species occurrence; Atlantic Ocean; United Kingdom; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Bidens; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon bidens; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,"This work was sponsored by both the Government and members of the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network.

Concentrations of ∑PCBs and ∑DDTs in the blubber of 17 fin whales from historical whaling stations in 1971-1972 were generally in agreement with previously reported values for fin whales from Atlantic Canada. Although some differences in sex and body length (age) distribution of samples occurred, significant differences were detected in the concentrations and patterns of PCBs, DDTs and chlordanes in whales from Nfld and NS, supporting ecological evidence that whales from these regions represent relatively separate stocks. Temporal and geographical variations were examined by comparing data to those reported for fin whales from the St Lawrence Estuary (StL) in 1991 by Gauthier et al. (1997a). Significantly higher levels of ∑DDT, ∑CHL and HCB were found in the NS (1971-1972) stock compared with the StL (1991) animals, and in HCB between the Nfld stock (1971-1972) and the StL (1991) animals, as well as higher p,p′-DDE/∑DDT and lower p,p′-DDT/∑DDT ratios in the 1991 whales suggesting that temporal trends in these whales between the 1970s and 1990s were consistent with those in other marine mammals in Atlantic Canada. Evidence also suggests that geographical variations in patterns may occur for individuals from two relatively distinct stocks of fin whales in Atlantic Canada (NS, Nfld) and perhaps for one population (StL) related to, but recognisably different from the NS stock. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Atlantic Canada; Fin whales; PCBs; Persistent organochlorines; Temporal trends","Biodiversity; Chlorine compounds; Pesticides; Whales; Contamination; chlordane; chlorphenotane; organochlorine derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; organochlorine; PCB; pesticide; spatial variation; temporal variation; whale; animal tissue; article; Atlantic Ocean; body height; Canada; comparative study; concentration (parameters); controlled study; female; geography; male; marine environment; nonhuman; sex; time; whale; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Canada; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Geography; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Population Dynamics; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Whales; Canada; Animalia; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Mammalia",,"Environmental Pollutants; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,"Addison, R.F., Organohalogen compounds (1984) Health of the Northwest Atlantic, pp. 77-84. , Wilson, R.C.H., Addison, R.F.

With the tracking technology and the development of telemetry, we can study large mammals under natural conditions. In 1991, a satellite tracking during 42 days on a fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) was obtained. The Argos system allowed us to know the location of this tagged fin whale 263 times. In this study, we can distinguish two kinds of movements: linear segments and tortuous segments with loops drawn in a clockwise direction. Such loops may be superficial oscillations of inertia due to the inertia of the water mass combined with earth's rotation. With this trial study, which is the best we have obtained, we can estimate the fractal dimension d of this trajectory at different observation scales. These d values seem to be scale-independent, so the fin whale path is fractal-like or scale-independent. Fractal dimension, which is a scale-independent measure, summarizes interactions between an organism and its ecosystem and depends on the heterogeneity of the whale's environment (exogeneous factors) and the whale's ability to perceive it (endogeneous factors). For the fin whale trajectory we calculated d = 1.03 +/-0.01 with the divider method. The aggregated distribution of available resources for the fin whale in the western Mediterranean Sea can explain this result close to 1. The heterogeneity of this food resources is not a 'measured heterogeneity' but is a 'functional heterogeneity'. The low fractal dimension also points to the low probability that the tagged fin whale and the zooplankton aggregates will meet in the western Mediterranean Sea so the fin whale must cover long straight lines from one patch of available zooplankton to another.","Argos location; Functional heterogeneity; Prey-predator relationship; Zooplankton patchiness","Ocean habitats; Telemetering; Tracking (position); Whale; Marine biology; biotelemetry; fractal analysis; movement; satellite; trajectory; whale; Mediterranean Sea",,,,,,,"Buskey, E.J., Swimming pattern as an indicator of the roles of copepod sensory systems in the recognition of food (1984) Mar.

Twelve specimens of P. balaenopterae were collected from Balaenoptera physalus in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Their morphological characteristics have been analysed by scanning electron microscopy and a detailed morphometric study has been accomplished. The buccal complex is described for the first time, providing details on the mouth, first maxillae, second maxillae, and buccal stylets, together with a new, trilobed structure not previously described for the genus. Other appendages are also presented, including the first antenna, second antenna, swimming legs, and other external and internal structures.

Measurements were carried out on both serum and urine from 21 whales so that results could be compared. The mean serum urea concentration in fin whales was similar to that in odontocetes but 5 times higher than in domesticated terrestrial mammals. Serum triglyceride concentrations were twice as high as in fasting man and showed no diurnal peaks. Serum cortisol concentrations were about 2 times lower than in domestic mammals and showed neither diurnal variation nor a significant correlation with chase time (time from sighting until killing). Serum aldosterone concentrations were similar to those in bottlenose dolphins and, as expected, showed a negative correlation with urinary Na+ concentration. Blood thyroxine levels correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.003) with chase time. Mean urinary potassium concentrations were 6 times higher than average seawater levels, while sodium and chloride levels were about 2-3 times higher than in humans but never as high as those in seawater. Urinary magnesium levels were 4-5 times higher than in domestic animals but less than half those in seawater.

Cataldo 1, 56100 Pisa, Italy","A comparative study was made on one Mysticete (the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus) and one Odontocete species (the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba) by measuring several morphological characteristics seen in cross sections of the optic nerve. We found that the two cetacean nerves share a number of specializations that distinguish them from the optic nerve of terrestrial mammals. Fiber density is approximately two-fold lower than in land mammals. A corresponding increase in the cross-sectional area occupied by astrocytes is observed. A population of ""giant"" (up to 15μm in diameter) optic axons is present in both the B. physalus and the S. coeruleoalba nerve. It is argued that these features probably reflect common adaptations to the constraints imposed by the aquatic environment. ""Giant"" optic axons might ensure short-latency detection of preys and other targets during navigation while the increased astroglial content might be related to the maintenance of neuronal function during periods of anaerobic metabolism under water.","Dolphin; Fiber density; Giant axons; Plesiomorphic character; Whale","anaerobic metabolism; animal tissue; article; astrocyte; comparative study; dolphin; echolocation; nerve function; nonhuman; optic nerve; priority journal; species differentiation; target cell; visual system function; whale; Animals; Axons; Cell Count; Dolphins; Nerve Fibers; Optic Nerve; Whales",,,,,,,"Coggeshall, R.E., Lekan, H.A., Methods for determining numbers of cells and synapses: A case for more uniform standards of review (1996) Journal of Comparative Neurology, 364, pp. 6-15; Dawson, W.W., Perez, J.M., Unusual retinal cells in the dolphin eye (1973) Science, 181, pp. 747-749; Dawson, W.W., Hawthorne, M.N., Jenkins, R.L., Goldston, R.T., Giant neural system in the inner retina and optic nerve of small whales (1982) Journal of Comparative Neurologv, 205, pp. 1-7; Dawson, W.W., Hope, G.M., Ulshafer, R.J., Hawthorne, M.N., Jenkins, R.L., Contents of the optic nerve of a small cetacean (1983) Aquatic Mammals, 10 (2), pp. 45-56; Dral, A.D.G., On the optics of the dolphin eye (1987) Aquatic Mammals, 13 (2), pp. 61-64; Gao, G., Zhou, K., Fiber analysis of the optic and cochlear nerves of small cetaceans (1992) Marine Mammal Sensory Systems, pp. 39-52. , ed.

Mysticete whales, including six endangered species, may be at risk from this noise pollution because all species produce and probably perceive low-fre-quency sound. We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of loud, LF noise on foraging fin blue (B. musculus) and (Balaenoptera physalus) whales off San Nicolas Island, California. Naive observers used a combination of attached tracking devices, ship-based surveys, aerial surveys, photo-identification and passive monitoring of vocal behaviour to examine the behaviour and distribution of whales when a loud LF source (US Navy SURTASS LFA) was and was not transmitting. During transmission, 12-30% of the estimated received levels of LFA of whales in the study area exceeded 140 dB re 1 μPa. However, whales continued to be seen foraging in the region. Overall, whale encounter rates and diving behaviour appeared to be more strongly linked to changes in prey abundance associated with oceanographic parameters than to LF sound transmissions. In some cases, whale vocal behaviour was significantly different between experimental and non-experimental periods. However, these differences were not consistent and did not appear to be related to LF sound transmissions. At the spatial and temporal scales examined, we found no obvious responses of whales to a loud, anthropogenic, LF sound. We suggest that the cumulative effects of anthropogenic LF noise over larger temporal and spatial scales than examined here may be a more important consideration for management agencies.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Musculus",,,,,,,"Bakun, A., Nelson, C.S., The seasonal cycle of wind stress curl in subtropical eastern boundary current regions (1991) J.

We used this positional information and oceanographic data (bathymetry, temperature, and salinity) to predict critical habitat off the coast of British Columbia for sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales. We used generalized linear models at annual and monthly time scales to relate whale occurrence to six predictor variables (month, depth, slope, depth class, and sea surface temperature and salinity). The models showed critical habitat for sei, fin, and male sperm whales along the continental slope and over a large area off the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Habitat models for blue, humpback, and female sperm whales were relatively insensitive to the predictor variables, owing partially to the smaller sample sizes for these groups. The habitat predictions lend support to recent hypotheses about sperm whale breeding off British Columbia and identify humpback whale habitat in sheltered bays and straits throughout the coast. The habitat models also provide insights about the nature of the linkages between the environment and the distribution of whales in the North Pacific Ocean.",,"ecological modeling; habitat use; prediction; whale; whaling; British Columbia; Canada; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus",,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Social organization in sperm whales (1979), pp. 227-289. , Behavior of marine animals.

This basin has limited exchange of water with the Atlantic Ocean and is surrounded by some of the most heavily populated and industrialized countries in the world. Accordingly, levels of some xenobiotics are much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this research the unexplored hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDCs is investigated. Here we illustrate the development of sensitive biomarkers (Vitellogenin, Zona Radiata proteins) for evaluation of toxicological risk in top marine predators (Xiphias gladius, Thunnus thynnus thynnus), and nonlethal techniques, such as nondestructive biomarkers (BPMO activities in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened species exposed to EDCs, such as marine mammals (Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis, and Balaenoptera physalus).","Biomarkers; BPMO; Endocrine disrupters; Marine mammals; Mediterranean Sea; Skin biopsy; Sword-fish; Top predators; Vitellogenin; Zona Radiata proteins","biological marker; oxidoreductase; vitellogenin; xenobiotic agent; animal tissue; conference paper; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; female; fish; industrialization; male; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; predator; risk assessment; skin biopsy; water pollution; animal; article; dolphin; drug effect; endocrine gland; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; food chain; metabolism; water pollutant; Western blotting; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Stenella coeruleoalba; Thunnus; Thunnus thynnus thynnus; Tursiops truncatus; Xiphias gladius; Animals; Blotting, Western; Dolphins; Endocrine Glands; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fishes; Food Chain; Male; Mediterranean Sea; Vitellogenins; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Whales",,"oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; Vitellogenins; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,"Colborn, T., Vom Saal, T., Soto, A.M., Developmental effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in wildlife and humans (1993) Environ.

We searched historical records and computerized stranding databases for evidence of ship strikes involving great whales (i.e., baleen whales and the sperm whale). Historical records suggest that ship strikes fatal to whales first occurred late in the 1800s as ships began to reach speeds of 13-15 kn, remained infrequent until about 1950, and then increased during the 1950s-1970s as the number and speed of ships increased. Of 11 species known to be hit by ships, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are struck most frequently; right whales (Eubalaena glacialis and E. australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whales (Physeter catodon), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are hit commonly. In some areas, one-third of all fin whale and right whale strandings appear to involve ship strikes. To assess contributing factors, we compiled descriptions of 58 collisions. They indicate that all sizes and types of vessels can hit whales; most lethal or severe injuries are caused by ships 80 m or longer; whales usually are not seen beforehand or are seen too late to be avoided; and most lethal or severe injuries involve ships travelling 14 kn or faster. Ship strikes can significantly affect small populations of whales, such as northern right whales in the western North Atlantic. In areas where special caution is needed to avoid such events, measures to reduce the vessel speed below 14 kn may be beneficial.","Mortality; Right whales; Ship collisions; Species conservation; Strandings","collision; mortality; shipping; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon",,,,,,,"Alexander, G., (1980) Blue whale apparently killed by Ship, (PART II), p. 8. , Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, CA. 8 July; Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Boston Society of Natural History.

No animals have been found to dive for durations that are consistently shorter than their TADL. We attached time-depth recorders to 7 blue whales and 15 fin whales (family Balaenopteridae). The diving behavior of both species was similar, and we distinguished between foraging and traveling dives. Foraging dives in both species were deeper, longer in duration and distinguished by a series of vertical excursions where lunge feeding presumably occurred. Foraging blue whales lunged 2.4 ( ± 1.13) times per dive, with a maximum of six times and average vertical excursion of 30.2 ( ± 10.04) m. Foraging fin whales lunged 1.7 ( ± 0.88) times per dive, with a maximum of eight times and average vertical excursion of 21.2 ( ± 4.35) m. The maximum rate of ascent of lunges was higher than the maximum rate of descent in both species, indicating that feeding lunges occurred on ascent. Foraging dives were deeper and longer than non-feeding dives in both species. On average, blue whales dived to 140.0 ( ± 46.01) m and 7.8 ( ± 1.89) min when foraging, and 67.6 ( ± 51.46) m and 4.9 ( ± 2.53) min when not foraging. Fin whales dived to 97.9 ( ± 32.59) m and 6.3 ( ± 1.53) min when foraging and to 59.3 ( ± 29.67) m and 4.2 ( ± 1.67) min when not foraging. The longest dives recorded for both species, 14.7 min for blue whales and 16.9 min for fin whales, were considerably shorter than the TADL of 31.2 and 28.6 min, respectively. An allometric comparison of seven families diving to an average depth of 80-150 m showed a significant relationship between body mass and dive duration once Balaenopteridae whales, with a mean dive duration of 6.8 min, were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the short dive durations of blue whales and fin whales cannot be explained by the shallow distribution of their prey. We propose instead that short duration diving in large whales results from either: (1) dispersal behavior of prey; or (2) a high energetic cost of foraging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Aerobic dive limit; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Blue whale; Diving; Fin whale; Foraging; Rorquals","allometry; animal behavior; body mass; conference paper; controlled study; depth perception; diving; energy cost; locomotion; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; species difference; time; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Musculus",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: 50ABNF500153, 40ABNC602168, 40ABNF600916

Two kinds of sample were obtained from the different species of cetaceans and pinnipeds in order to evaluate the toxicological risk to which a species or population is exposed: those from stranded specimens and those from free-ranging specimens. In this paper the use of a non-destructive approach, biopsy sampling, for free-ranging marine mammals is recommended.Lipophilic contaminants, such as organochlorine compounds and PAHs, are ubiquitous in the marine environment. An overview is presented of the presence of lipophilic contaminants in marine mammals, which is based on research conducted under the auspices of Siena University in Italy. The studies have centered on the Mediterranean Sea and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The sampling procedures employed, involving Mediterranean cetaceans and Argentinean pinnipeds, are outlined, along with the analytical methods used, and extensive data are presented for striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, fin whale, and stranded and free-ranging South American pinnipeds. Differences are shown in the contaminant concentrations in the two dolphin species, which are attributed particularly to diet differences. Striped dolphins have been found to be especially vulnerable to these contaminants. The levels of organochlorines in sea lions have been determined to be lower than those measured in other marine mammal species in the Northern Hemisphere, but relatively high PAH concentrations have been noted in sea lions at Mar del Plata and Punta Bermeja.",,"Dolphins; Lipophilic contaminants; Marine mammals; Pinnipeds; Toxicological risks; Whales; Marine biology; Nondestructive examination; Organic compounds; Risk assessment; Sampling; Toxicity; Marine pollution; Arctocephalus australis; Arctocephalus tropicalis; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Mammalia; Otaria flavescens; Otariidae; Panthera leo; Phocidae; Pinnipedia; Stenella coeruleoalba; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Addison, R.F., Organochlorines and marine mammal reproduction (1989) Can.

The susceptibility of these animals to organic pollutants and the relationship between bioaccumulation and population decline (as in the case of Delphinus delphis) are unexplored fields. In this study, we used a non-destructive approach (skin biopsy) to explore OC bioaccumulation processes and mixed-function oxidase activity (BPMO) in four species of cetaceans: striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), common dolphin (D. delphis) and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). Significant differences in BPMO induction and OC levels were found between odontocetes and mysticetes, the former having mixed-function oxidase activities four times higher than the latter, binding with levels of OCs one order of magnitude higher in odontocetes. A significant correlation (P<0.05) between BPMO activities and OC levels was found in B. physalus. In an ongoing project, fibroblast cultures have been used as an alternative in vitro method of evaluating interspecies susceptibility to contaminants such as OCs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These results suggest that cetacean skin biopsies are a powerful non-invasive tool for assessing ecotoxicological risk to Mediterranean marine mammals species.

Analyses of whale tissues (blubber, liver and kidney) were carried out in order to elucidate the contamination pattern present in the whale, as indicator of the contaminants present in its habitat from the Mauretanian coast to Ligurian Sea, sited in the western Mediterranean area. A multiresidue method based on normal-phase LC prior to GC-MS determination of residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides and derivatives and lipophylic organophosphorus (OP) pesticides was applied. Moreover, determination of heavy metals by ICP-MS was carried out, selecting for quantitative analysis Cr, As, Cd, Hg and Pb. Results obtained show high concentrations of PCBs and pp(')DDE, at μg g-1 level, as well as significant concentrations of As and Hg, which could affected the condition of the animal, and as a consequence, its survivor possibilities.

The catch data were analyzed using annual and monthly mean values. Monthly and annual variation in whaling effort was deduced from accounts of the history of British Columbia coastal whaling, and biases arising from changes in effort were considered in the interpretation of the results. During the later years of whaling (1948-1967), the mean lengths of captured whales declined significantly and pregnancy rates dropped to near zero in fin, sei, and blue whales. Monthly patterns in numbers killed revealed a summer migration of sei and blue whales past Vancouver Island, and confirms anecdotal suggestions that local populations of fin and humpback whales once spent extended periods in the coastal waters of British Columbia. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that sperm whales mated (April-May) and calved (July-August) in British Columbia's offshore waters. The historic whaling records reveal much about the migratory behavior and distribution of the large whales species as they once were, and may continue to be, in the northeastern Pacific. Verifying the persistence of these trends in the remnant populations is a necessary and logical next step.","Blue whale; British Columbia; Fin whale; Humpback whale; Migration; North Pacific; Population structure; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Whaling","fishery survey; long-term change; migration; population structure; whale; (Northeast); British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Best, P.B., (1979) Social Organization in Sperm Whales, pp. 227-289. , H.

The total PCB concentration (sum of 41 congeners) ranged from 484 to 63,200 ng/g wet weight. The 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalents (TEQs), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), ranged from 4.3 to 1,454 pg/g wet weight. The contribution of mono-ortho PCBs was consistently higher than non-ortho PCB congeners, in whale species, whereas in dolphins this predominance was not so clear. The PCB profiles were dominated by congeners 138, 153, and 180 in almost all the investigated samples. Comparison of PCB profiles by using principal component analysis allowed to separate the species into different groups. Polychlorinated biphenyls 170 and 180 seem to be eliminated by the two whale species, and PCB 180 also seems to be eliminated by Risso's dolphins. The PCBs 95, 132, 149, and 176 revealed an enantiomeric excess of the second eluted enantiomer in almost all the cetaceans investigated, where 136 and 174 were racemic or almost racemic. It is the first time that an enantiomeric excess of PCB 84 and 91 has been reported in biological samples. Although it was only possible to calculate them in two dolphin liver samples, the high values of enantiomeric excess found are surprising (86.3 and 32% for PCB 91 and 84, respectively).","Cetaceans; Enantioselective analysis; Mediterranean sea; Polychlorinated biphenyls",,,,,,,,"Tanabe, S., Tatsukawa, R., Persistent organochlorines in marine mammals (1991) Organic Contaminants in the Environment - Pathways and Effects, pp. 275-289. , Jones KC, ed, Elsevier Applied Science, New York, NY, USA; Moessner, S., Ballschmitter, K., Marine mammals as global pollution indicators for organochlorines (1997) Chemosphere, 34, pp. 1285-1296; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Abnormally high polychlorinated biphenyl levels in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) affected by the 1990-1992 Mediterranean epizootic (1994) Sci Total Environ, 154, pp. 237-247; Reijnders, P.J.H., Reproductive failure in harbour seals feeding on fish from polluted coastal waters (1986) Nature, 324, pp. 456-457; Fossi, M.C., Marsili, L., Leonzio, C., Notarbartolo Di Sciara, G., Zanardelli, M., Focardi, S., The use of non-destructive biomarkers in Mediterranean cetaceans: Preliminary data on MFO activity in skin biopsy (1992) Mar Pollut Bull, 24, pp. 459-461; Cummins, J.E., Extinction: The PCB threats to marine mammals (1988) Ecologist, 18, pp. 193-195; Borrell, A., Aguilar, A., Corsolini, S., Focardi, S., Evaluation of toxicity and sex-related variation of PCB levels in Mediterranean striped dolphins affected by an epizootic (1996) Chemosphere, 32, pp. 2359-2369; Marsili, L., Focardi, S., Organochlorine levels in subcutaneous blubber biopsies of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from the Mediterranean Sea (1996) Environ Pollut, 91, pp. 1-9; Cardellicchio, N., Persistent contaminants in dolphins: An indication of chemical pollution in the Mediterranean Sea (1995) Water Sci Technol, 32, pp. 331-340; Kannan, K., Tanabe, S., Omo, M., Tatsukawa, R., Critical evaluation of polychlorinated biphenyl toxicity in terrestrial and marine mammals: Increasing impact of non-ortho and mono-ortho coplanar (1989) Arch Environ Contain Toxicol, 18, pp. 850-857; Faller, K., Kühnerfuss, H., König, W.A., Krebber, R., Ludwig, P., Do marine bacteria degrade α-hexachlorociclohexane (α-HCH) stereoselectively?

The records of the Dwarf Sperm Whale and that of the Risso's Dolphin are the first for eastern Canada. The record of the Sowerby's Beaked Whale is the first reported stranding in Nova Scotia. Humpback, Minke, and Killer whales, and Short-beaked Common Dolphins have not previously been recorded stranded on Sable Island. The majority of stranding events (84) were of a single animal; nine involved two animals; eight involved 3-10 animals; and one event involved over 130 animals. Recorded strandings increased from 1.9 strandings/year between 1970-1989 to 7.1 strandings/year between 1990-1998. Mass strandings of multiple male Sperm Whales have occurred three times (all since 1990).
