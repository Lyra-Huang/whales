The pygmy right whale is the smallest baleen whale and the only member of the family Neobalaenidae. Diagnostic features of the pygmy right whale include long, narrow, creamy-white baleen plates with an outer margin of brown or black and very fine bristles; a clearly visible band of white gum at the base of the baleen; a moderately arched rostrum that becomes more pronounced as the animal grows; a small, falcate dorsal fin placed about 25-30% of body length from the tail; and shallow throat creases in some animals. The pygmy right whale lives in temperate and subantarctic regions where water temperatures are between about 5° and 20°C. It has been seen in oceanic and neritic environments where some individuals have spent up to 2 months very close to shore, possibly feeding while there. Seasonal movements inshore may be related to the availability of food during spring and summer. The surface behavior of pygmy right whales is inconspicuous but because so few observations have been reported the complete repertoire may not have been recorded. Swimming speeds of 3-8 knots have been noted, and the whale is also capable of very fast acceleration and speed, leaving a conspicuous wake when doing so. When pygmy right whales dive they remain submerged for up to 4 min and surface briefly before diving again. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Five species (Eubalaena australis, Megaptera novaeangliae, Tasmacetus shepherdi, Globicephala melas and Orcinus orca) have been sighted within the territorial waters of the archipelago, eight species (Balaenoptera physalus, B. borealis, B. acutorostrata/bonaerensis, Physeter macrocephalus, Mesoplodon mirus, M. bowdoini, Delphinus sp. and Lissodelphis peronii) have been seen or taken within 200 nautical miles (360km) of the group or have been found stranded on its shores, while another two species (Caperea marginata and Lagenorhynchus obscurus) have been recorded close enough to be considered likely to occur within 200 nautical miles. The records of Mesoplodon mirus and M. bowdoini represent significant extensions to their known distribution. Apart from its possible importance as a mid-oceanic nursery area for southern right whales, the waters of the Tristan Archipelago seem to be a concentration area for T. shepherdi, one of the least-known of the world's cetaceans. © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cetacean records; South Atlantic; Tristan da Cunha","archipelago; biological survey; cetacean; nursery ground; spatial distribution; species inventory; stranding; volcano; whaling; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Inaccessible Island; Saint Helena; Tristan da Cunha; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Caperea marginata; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Eubalaena australis; Globicephala melas; Lagenorhynchus obscurus; Lissodelphis peronii; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon mirus; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Tasmacetus shepherdi",,,,,,"Andrew, T.G., Hecht, T., Heemstra, P.C., Lutjeharms, J.R.E., Fishes of the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean (1995) Ichthyological Bulletin of the J.

Records were concentrated on the edge of the South Australian gulfs, around Tasmania, at Stewart Island, in Cook Strait, and in the Auckland area. Limited data suggest that these may be related to planktonrich waters nearby. Body lengths ranged from 198 to 650 cm. Overall sex ratio was 0.70 (males:females). In regions north of about 41°S, juveniles (preweaning) made up 41% of the records and subadults (postweaning) were rare (13%). In regions south of about 41°S subadults (36%) were proportionately more abundant than juveniles (17%). Neonates were recorded from 35°37′ to 47°00′S. Adults were found throughout the latitudinal range of the species in Australasia. The diet of the pygmy right whale included copepods and small euphausiids. Behavior consistent with feeding has been observed in coastal waters of Australia.","Age class; Body length; Calving; Caperea marginata; Diet; Latitude; Pygmy right whale; Sex ratio; Sightings; Strandings; Subtropical Convergence","body size; diet; geographical distribution; latitude; sex ratio; stranding; whale; Australasia; Balaenidae; Caperea marginata; Caperea marginata; Cetacea; Copepoda; Euphausiidae; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,"(1986) Australia's marine and estuarine areas - A policy for protection, , Occasional Paper No. 1. 30 pp; Arnold, A., Portland's chance encounter with a pygmy right whale (1987) Australian Natural History, 22, pp. 266-270; Baker, A.N., Yaldwyn, J., Islands oceans and marine life patterns (1976) Australian Natural History, 18, pp. 376-381; Bannister, J.L., Kemper, C.M., Warneke, R.M., (1996) The action plan for Australian cetaceans, , Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Canberra; Belkin, I.M., Gordon, A.L., Southern Ocean fronts from the Greenwich meridian to Tasmania (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research, 10, pp. 3675-3696; Bradford, J.M., Systematics and ecology of New Zealand central coast plankton sampled at Kaikoura (1972) New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Bulletin, 207. , 87 pp; Bradford, J.M., Chapman, B., Nyctiphanes australis (Euphausiidae) and an upwelling plume in western Cook Strait, New Zealand (1988) New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 22, pp. 237-247; Bradford, J.M., Lapennas, P.P., Murtagh, R.A., Chang, F.H., Wilkinson, V., Factors controlling summer phytoplankton production in greater Cook Strait, New Zealand (1986) New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 20, pp. 253-279; Brody, S., (1964) Bioenergetics and growth, , Hafner Publishing Company, New York, NY; Budylenko, G.A., Panfilov, B.G., Pakhomova, A.A., Sazhinov, E.G., New data on pygmy right whales Neobalaena marginata (Gray, 1848) (1973) Trudy Atlanticheskii Nauchno-Issledovatel'skii Institut Rybnogo Khozyaistva i Okeanografii, 51, pp. 122-132; Bunt, J.S., The Australian marine environment (1987) Fauna of Australia Volume 1A General articles, 1 A, pp. 17-42. , G.
