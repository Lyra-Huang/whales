The effectiveness of measures (e.g., protected areas, abundance surveys) intended to promote recovery of this population will be enhanced by understanding its distribution, habitat use, and habitat characteristics. In order to facilitate such understanding, we summarized relevant right whale biology, reviewed the life history of their zooplankton prey species, and related North Pacific oceanography to the production, distribution, and concentration of these prey at three scales of variability. We discuss how ocean processes may drive zooplankton distribution and concentration, and present hypotheses about how prey patches suitable for right whale foraging might be formed. Such hypotheses, combined with available distributional data and descriptions of the ocean environment, would be suitable for predicting potential right whale foraging habitat. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The migration route(s) and wintering area(s) used by this population are largely unknown. Gray whales once had a fairly extensive distribution in the Sea of Okhotsk but little detailed information has been published on when and where they occurred. Open-boat, ship-based whalers from the United States and a few other countries conducted an intensive hunt for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1840s to 1870s. According to entries in voyage logbooks, the American whalers regularly encountered (and sometimes hunted) gray whales in the far northeastern corner of the Okhotsk Sea (Shelikhov Bay, Gizhiginskaya Bay and Penzhinskaya Gulf) between early May-late August. They also observed gray whales in summer along the northern coast of the sea (especially Tauskaya Bay), around the Shantar Islands, in Sakhalin Bay, off Cape Elizabeth at the northern tip of Sakhalin Island and along the west coast of the Kamchatka peninsula. No evidence was found in the logbooks studied of gray whales (and indeed of whaling effort) off northeastern Sakhalin Island where most observations of gray whales occur in the present day.","Bowhead whale; Gray whale; North pacific right whale; Northern hemisphere; Sea of okhotsk; Whaling-historical","endangered species; migration; Northern Hemisphere; open water; population distribution; population structure; seafood; summer; whale; whaling; Eurasia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Sea of Okhotsk; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"(1866) Logbook of the Ship Benjamin Cummings of New Bedford, Charles Halsey, Master. 27 September 1866-1929 November 1869, p. 462. , Benjamin Cummings, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log ODHS; (1866) Logbook of the Ship Benjamin Cummings of New Bedford, Charles Halsey, Master. 27 September 1866-1871 May 1871, , Benjamin Cummings, New Bedford Free Public Library, New Bedford, Massachusetts; Williams, B., (1851) Logbook of the Ship Betsy Williams of Stonington, Gilbert Pendleton, Jr., Master 23 April 1851-1920 April 1854, p. 370. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # KWM; Cicero, (1856) Logbook of the Ship Cicero of New Bedford, Charles Courtney, Master 12 August 1856-1916 May 1860, p. 377. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; Europa, (1866) Logbook of the Ship Europa of Edgartown, Thomas Mellen, Master 29 August 1866-1921 August 1870, p. 663. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; Euphrates, (1857) Logbook of the Ship Euphrates of New Bedford, William H Heath, Master. 15 October 1857-1867 April 1861, p. 384. , Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1851) Logbook of the Ship Good Return of New Bedford, Benjamin Franklin Wing, Master 2 September 1851-1856 April 1855, p. 794. , Good Return, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1853) Logbook of the Ship Governor Troup of New Bedford, Anthony Milton, Master 1 August 1853-1915 April 1856, p. 829. , Governor Troup, Kendall Institute, New Bedford Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Log # ODHS; (1863) Logbook of the Ship Josephine of New Bedford.

We detected right whale calls on the SEBS middle shelf (<100 m depth) as early as May, intermittently throughout summer and fall, and as late as December. Calls also were detected on one day in June 2005 on the SEBS slope (>1,000 m), but were not detected near Kodiak Island from April to August 2003. In months with calls, detections occurred on more days in July-October (≥6 d/mo), than from May to June or November to December (≤3 d/mo). Calls were clustered in time and were usually detected on 1-3 consecutive days with a median interval of 6.5 d for calls >1 d apart. Hourly calling rates were significantly higher at night than during the day. These data indicate that right whales occur in the SEBS later in the year than previously known, intermittently pass through the middle-shelf study region, and usually remain there no longer than a few days. Right whale habitat use in the SEBS may intensify in mid-summer through early fall based on higher monthly and daily call detection rates. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic monitoring; Bering Sea; Eubalaena japonica; North Pacific right whale","acoustic method; biomonitoring; calling behavior; detection method; diel variation; habitat use; hydrophone; whale; Alaska; Bering Sea; Kodiak Island; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Mobley, J., Burgess, W.C., Lammers, M.O., Nachtigall, P.E., Seasonal and diurnal trends of chorusing humpback whales wintering in waters off western Maui (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 530-544. , and; Barlow, J., (2005) Cruise Report: Marine Mammal Cruise Number 1625: Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpbacks (SPLASH), Cruise Number: AR-04-05.

This paper interprets records of the early history of whaling for North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena pacifica). The current population occupies only a fraction of its historical range. Historical distributions of several whale species have been inferred from charts prepared by Matthew Fontaine Maury in the early 1850s and Charles Haskins Townsend in the 1930s based on data from American whalers' logbooks. In the North Pacific, Maury's chart has been interpreted to show that right whales occurred continuously across the entire basin. However, we find plotting errors when we compare the North Pacific chart to the corresponding data worksheets prepared for Maury (the 'Maury Abstracts') and the chart appears to have misled historians and biologists. Although these charts and those in the North Atlantic are wrong, the Maury Abstracts themselves appear largely consistent with the original whaler logbooks. Our analysis shows that right whales were likely not distributed continuously across the North Pacific, but instead had a pronounced longitudinally bimodal distribution and were encountered infrequently in the central-northern North Pacific. This work shows how valuable information can be obtained by examining original source material. The American whaling logbooks are extensive and have been largely overlooked in studies of whale populations. © 2008 The Authors.","Historical fisheries; Matthew Fontaine Maury; Right whales; Seasonal distribution; Sperm whales; Whaling","abundance; error analysis; historical record; paleobiogeography; population distribution; seasonality; species occurrence; whale; whaling; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena japonica; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 10, pp. 191-199; Bannister, J., Status of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) off Australia (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 103-110; Bannister, J., Mitchell, E., North Pacific sperm whale stock identity: Distributional evidence from Maury and Townsend charts (1980) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 2, pp. 219-230; Bannister, J.L., Josephson, E.A., Reeves, R.R., Smith, T.D., There she blew!

Since this time, there have been a few summer time visual surveys for these species, but no overview of year-round use of these waters by endangered whales primarily because standard visual survey data are difficult and costly. From October 1999-May 2002, moored hydrophones were deployed in six locations in the GoA to record whale calls. Reception of calls from fin, humpback, and blue whales and an unknown source, called Watkins' whale, showed seasonal and geographic variation. Calls were detected more often during the winter than during the summer, suggesting that animals inhabit the GoA year-round. To estimate the distance at which species-diagnostic calls could be heard, parabolic equation propagation loss models for frequencies characteristic of each of each call type were run. Maximum detection ranges in the subarctic North Pacific ranged from 45 to 250 km among three species (fin, humpback, blue), although modeled detection ranges varied greatly with input parameters and choice of ambient noise level. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Climate change; Fish; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Seawater; Ambient noise level; Frequencies characteristics; Standard visual surveys; Acoustic noise measurement; article; balaeno borealis; balaeno musculus; balaeno physalus; controlled study; environmental temperature; eubalaena japonica; frequency analysis; geographical variation (species); geography; Gulf stream; megaptera novoeangliae; noise; nonhuman; parameter; priority journal; seasonal variation; sound detection; species; United States; whale; winter; Acoustics; Alaska; Animals; Balaenoptera; Computer Simulation; Echolocation; Fin Whale; Humpback Whale; Models, Biological; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Seasons; Seawater; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean, JISAO

Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (B. acutorostrata) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and 6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On 10 August 2004, two right whales were located in the Bering Sea using headings to right whale calls provided by directional sonobuoys. A satellite-monitored radio tag attached to one of these whales functioned for 40 days. Over the 40-day period, this whale moved throughout a large part of the southeast Bering Sea shelf, including areas of the outer-shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades. In September, multiple right whales were acoustically located and subsequently sighted by another survey vessel approaching a near-real-time position from the tag. An analysis of photographs confirmed at least 17 individual whales (not including the tagged whales). Genetic analysis of biopsy samples identified 17 individuals: 10 males and 7 females. The discovery of seven females was significant, as only one female had been identified in the past. Genetics also confirmed the presence of at least two calves. Although the future of this population is highly uncertain, the discovery of additional females and calves gives some hope that this most critically endangered of all whale populations may still possess the capacity to recover. © 2006 US Government.","Bering Sea; Eubalaena japonica; Genetics; North Pacific right whale; Satellite-monitored radio tag; Sonobuoy","acoustic method; biomonitoring; endangered species; genetic analysis; satellite; tracking; whale; animal tissue; article; auditory discrimination; controlled study; endangered species; Eubalaena japonica; female; genetic analysis; male; nonhuman; population abundance; population biology; priority journal; vocalization; whale; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"Brownell Jr., R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J.

We used sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI gene to ask (i) whether cyamid population structures might reveal associations among right whale individuals and subpopulations, (ii) whether the divergences of the three nominally conspecific cyamid species on North Atlantic, North Pacific, and southern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis, Eubalaena japonica, Eubalaena australis) might indicate their times of separation, and (iii) whether the shapes of cyamid gene trees might contain information about changes in the population sizes of right whales. We found high levels of nucleotide diversity but almost no population structure within oceans, indicating large effective population sizes and high rates of transfer between whales and subpopulations. North Atlantic and Southern Ocean populations of all three species are reciprocally monophyletic, and North Pacific C. erraticus is well separated from North Atlantic and southern C. erraticus. Mitochondrial clock calibrations suggest that these divergences occurred around 6 million years ago (Ma), and that the Eubalaena mitochondrial clock is very slow. North Pacific C. ovalis forms a clade inside the southern C. ovalis gene tree, implying that at least one right whale has crossed the equator in the Pacific Ocean within the last 1-2 million years (Myr). Low-frequency polymorphisms are more common than expected under neutrality for populations of constant size, but there is no obvious signal of rapid, interspecifically congruent expansion of the kind that would be expected if North Atlantic or southern right whales had experienced a prolonged population bottleneck within the last 0.5 Myr. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cyamus;

Data were sampled by autonomous, bottom-mounted hydrophones deployed in the southeastern Bering Sea from October 2000 through August 2002. A human analyst detected right whale calls within the first month (October 2000) of recorded data by visually examining spectrograms and by listening to recorded data; these manual detections were then compared to results of automated detection trials. Automated detection by spectrogram cross-correlation was implemented using a synthetic kernel based on the most common right whale call type. To optimize automated detection parameters, the analyst performed multiple trials on minutes-long and hour-long recordings and manually adjusted detection parameters between trials. A single set of optimized detection parameters was used to process a week-long recording from October 2000. The automated detector trials resulted in increasing proportions of false and missed detections with increasing data set duration, due to the higher proportion of acoustic noise and lower overall call rates in longer recordings. However, the automated detector missed only one calling ""bout"" (2 or more calls within a 10-minute span) of the 18 bouts present in the week-long recording. Despite the high number of false detections and missed individual calls, spectrogram cross-correlation was useful to guide a human analyst to sections of data with potential right whale calling bouts. Upon reviewing automatic detection events, the analyst could quickly dismiss false detections and search recordings before and after correct detections to find missed calls, thus improving the efficiency of searching for a small number of calls in long-term (months- to years-long) recordings.",,"Acoustic noise; Automation; Correlation methods; Hydrophones; Marine biology; Ocean habitats; Optimization; Signal detection; Bearing sea; Long-term recording; Spectrogram; Whale calls; Underwater acoustics",,,,,,,"Bond, N.A., Adams, J.M., Atmospheric forcing of the southeast Bering Sea Shelf during 1995 99 in the context of a 40-year historical record (2002) Deep-Sea Res.

To help define areas and ecological parameters critical to the survival and recovery of the remnant population of North Pacific right whales, habitat use was investigated by examining all available sighting and catch records in the south-eastern Bering Sea (SEBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) over the past two centuries. 2. Based on re-analyses of co mmercial whaling records, search effort, and resultant catches and sightings, waters of the: (i) SEBS slope and shelf, (ii) eastern Aleutian Islands and (iii) GOA slope and abyssal plain were important habitat for North Pacific right whales through the late 1960s. 3. Since 1980, the only area where right whales have been s een consistently is on the SEBS middle shelf. However, acoustic detections and single sightings have been reported in all other regions except the SEBS slope and oceanic GOA (areas where little, if any, acoustic and visual effort has occurred). 4. Sightings since 1979 were in waters <20 0 m deep which may simply reflect the paucity of search effort elsewhere. From the commercial whaling era to the late 1960s, right whales were commonly seen in waters >2000 m deep, indicating that their distribution is not restricted to shallow continental shelves. 5. North Pacific right whale sightings thr ough the centuries have been associated with a variety of oceanic features, and there is little in common in the bathymetry of these regions. These whales appear to have a greater pelagic distribution than that observed in the North Atlantic, which may be related to the availability of larger copepods across the SEBS and GOA. © 2005 Mammal Society.","Cetacean; Distribution; Endangered; Marine mammal; Oceanography; Prey","endangered species; habitat use; historical record; population distribution; whale; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Bering Sea; Gulf of Alaska; North America; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena japonica; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Japan: Progress report on whale research, June 1974 to May 1975 (1976) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 26, pp. 416-424. , Anonymous; Japan: Progress report on cetacean research, June 1978 to May 1979 (1980) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 30, pp. 155-160. , Anonymous; Japan: Progress report on cetacean research, June 1979 to May 1980 (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 195-200. , Anonymous; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress in Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress in Series, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Marine Ecology Progress in Series, 264, pp. 137-154; Best, P.B., Estimates of the landed catch of right (and other whalebone) whales in the American fishery, 1805-1909 (1987) Fishery Bulletin US, 85, pp. 403-418; Bockstoce, J.R., (1986) Whales, Ice and Men: The History of Whaling in the Western Arctic, , University of Washington Press, Seattle, WA; Brown, C.W., Winn, H.E., Relationship between the distribution pattern of right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, and satellite-derived sea surface thermal structure in the Great South Channel (1989) Continental Shelf Research, 9, pp. 247-260; Brownell Jr., R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2, pp. 269-286; Brueggeman, J.J., Grotefendt, R.A., Erickson, A.W., Endangered whale abundance and distribution in the Navarin Basin of the Bering Sea during the ice-free period (1984) Proceedings of the Workshop on Biological Interactions Among Marine Mammals and Commercial Fisheries in the Southeastern Bering Sea, pp. 201-236. , (Ed. by B.R.

The overall distribution of these small, migratory populations is not well known, especially outside of summer. Passive acoustic monitoring is a tool that could provide information on locations of whales. Better distributional information will inform management efforts to reduce anthropogenic mortalities caused by both ship strikes and fisheries interactions. Recent research on passive acoustic monitoring is summarised, focusing on developments relevant to detection and classification of right whale calls. Some outstanding research requirements are outlined, including the need for the development of models to investigate the potential for risk reduction from acoustic data.

Propagation within this waveguide produces waveform dispersion which is dependent upon range. We present a means for using dispersed waveforms to determine range to calling whales from a single autonomous acoustic recording instrument. The predominant North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) call is frequency upswept from about 90 Hz to around 160 Hz and lasts approximately 1 s. The regional bathymetry of the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is relatively uniform and shallow (∼70 meters deep). This geometry provides a plane-layered waveguide in which right whale upswept calls can be detected at ranges over 50 km and have multiple modal arrivals that become dispersed, displaying different propagation velocities for different frequencies. Dispersion characteristics of modal arrivals are dependent on the calling whale's depth, the receiver's depth, the water depth, the range from caller to receiver, and various environmental parameters including water and sediment density and sound velocity. A model of sound propagation for the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is developed from right whale call dispersion recorded on sonobuoys and seafloor acoustic recording packages, using individual calls recorded at multiple instruments. After development of the model, waveform dispersion allows estimation of caller range based on single instrument recordings. Estimating range between instrument and calling whales provides a means to estimate minimum abundance for the endangered North Pacific right whale.",,"Acoustic recording; Sediment density; Waveguide propagation; Whales; Acoustic waves; Modal analysis; Parameter estimation; Sediments; Waveform analysis; Waveguides; Biodiversity",,,,,,,"Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.R., Thomas, L., (1993) Distance Sampling: Estimating Abudance of Biological Populations, , London, Chapman and Hall; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell Jr., R.L., Baleen whales: Conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Review, 29, pp. 35-60; Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the Southern right whale, a qualitative analysis (1982) Anim.

The North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), once plentiful across much of the North Pacific Ocean, is now rarely seen in coastal British Columbian waters, and the number of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in southern British Columbia has been steadily decreasing in recent years. The recovery plan for these species is based on the gathering of baseline data on occurrence, distribution, abundance and habitat, and one significant component of this data collection is based on the deployment of multiple passive acoustical recording systems off the coast of British Columbia. In addition to the development and use of a simple but effective two-hydrophone array, two different autonomous passive acoustical instruments have been developed, one deployable at shore sites and the other for offshore locations. To limit data storage and power requirements, both of these systems have been equipped with killer whale recognition hardware to record only when the probability of killer whales in the area is relatively high. In addition the offshore units have been designed as hybrid recorders, sampling at 1000 Hz for the larger baleen whales and 20 kHz when killer whales are present. Both of these instruments have been designed for deployment periods as long as 12 months and are presently deployed in locations along the BC coast. The analysis of the large data sets from these instruments is a challenge and we are currently investigating the use of neural network algorithms to perform not only species recognition but also, with regards to the killer whale population, clan or group identification. The goal is to adapt these algorithms directly into the self-contained instruments.",,"Acoustic monitoring devices; Acoustic Recording systems; Data sets; Passive acoustics; Algorithms; Coastal zones; Computer hardware; Data recording; Data storage equipment; Ecology; Hydrophones; Marine biology; Neural networks; Offshore structures; Probability; Real time systems; Sustainable development; Biodiversity",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Taylor, B.L., (1998) Preliminary Abundance of Sperm Whales in the Northeastern Temperate Pacific Estimated from a Combined Visual and Acoustic Survey, , Document number SC/50/CAWS20, Int.
