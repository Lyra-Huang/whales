Many of their calls have been shown to be detectable through spectrogram correlation due to the low variation in these stereotyped calls. In this work, we describe rule based classifiers for tonal B and D calls using the pitch/frequency contour information obtained from a contour extractor. B calls can be detected by spectrogram correlation, but the D calls are highly variable and are therefore difficult to detect using spectrogram kernel methods. Experiments on four hours of evaluation data from different field seasons show that 91.3% of B calls and 85.8% of D calls were correctly retrieved. For both types of calls, less than 2% of the retrieved calls were false positives. ©2009 IEEE.",,"Blue whale; Call classification; Contour information; False positive; Frequency domains; Gain insight; Kernel methods; Passive acoustic monitoring; Rule-based classifier; Spectrograms; Oceanography; Spectrographs",,,,,,,"Oleson, E.M., Wiggins, S.M., Hildebrand, J.A., Temporal separation of blue whale call types on a southern California feeding ground (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 881-894; Mellinger, D.K., Clark, C.W., Recognizing transient low-frequency whale sounds by spectrogram correlation (2000) J.

Monthly values for satellite-derived oceanographic data and whale call data were compared for 4 regions (30° longitude by 15° of latitude) encompassing the whole subarctic North Pacific and an area in the temperate northeastern Pacific. To determine predictive models for whale call occurrence, generalized linear models were used to determine which, if any, oceanographic variables might influence whale calling behavior over such broad space and time scales. Seasurface temperature was the best oceanographic variable for predicting whale call detections for both species and all regions. © Inter-Research 2009.","Acoustics; Blue whale; Fin whale; North pacific; Oceanography","bioacoustics; biological oceanography; calling behavior; numerical model; satellite data; sea surface temperature; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

Historical acoustic recordings dating back as far as the 1960s were examined, measuring the tonal frequencies of 1000s of blue whale songs. Within a given year, individuals match the song frequency (related to 'pitch' in musical nomenclature) to within less than 3%. The best documented song type, that observed offshore of California, USA, now is sung at a frequency 31% lower than it was in the 1960s. Data available for 7 of the world's 10 known song types show they are all shifting downward in frequency, though at different rates. Any behavioral, ecological, oceanographic or anthropogenic change hypothesis seeking to explain the observed shifts should account for the worldwide occurrence of a nearly linear downward shift in the tonal frequencies of blue whale song. Hypotheses examined consider sexual selection, increasing ocean noise, increasing whale body size post whaling, global warming, interference from other animal sounds and post whaling increases in abundance. None of the commonly suggested hypotheses were found to provide a full explanation; however, increasing population size post whaling provides an intriguing and testable hypothesis that recovery is altering the sexually selected tradeoff for singing males between song amplitude (the ability to be heard at a greater distance) and song frequency (the ability to produce songs of lower pitch). © Inter-Research 2009.","Abundance; Ambient noise; Blue whale; Population growth rate; Recovery; Sexual selection; Song","abundance; ambient noise; behavioral ecology; growth rate; hypothesis testing; population growth; population size; sexual selection; song; species conservation; species occurrence; whale; California; United States; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Megaptera",,,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Dzieciuch, M.A., Ocean ambient sound: comparing the 1960's with the 1990's for a receiver off the California coast (2002) Acoust Res Lett Online, 3, pp. 65-70; Aroyan, J.L., McDonald, M.A., Webb, S.C., Hildebrand, J.A., Clark, D., Reidenberg, J.S., Laitman, J.T., Acoustic models of sound production and propagation (2000) Hearing by whales and dolphins.

Data were collected on sixteen California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) quarterly cruises (lines 77-93) from July 2004-March 2008.The most frequently sighted large whales were humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, 67 sightings), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus, 52 sightings), and blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus, 36 sightings). Blue and humpback whale sightings peaked in summer (July/August) and fin whales were most frequently seen in summer and fall, consistent with known migratory patterns. In spring through fall, whale sighting locations were associated with colder SST and greater zooplankton abundance levels compared to averages from random locations on the trackline.These results support the hypothesis that foraging distributions of large whales are linked to cold surface temperatures, which may indicate processes that enhance prey production and accumulation, such as upwelling or advection of productive water within the California Current. However, winter distributions of whales presumed to be migrating do not appear to be related to the habitat variables we analyzed, and may be harder to predict based on oceanographic data.The frequency of CalCOFI cruises provides us with high temporal resolution and an ongoing, long time series compared to other survey efforts, allowing comparison between seasons and years that will increase our understanding of these top predators and their response to habitat variability within an important subregion of the California Current Ecosystem.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem (2007) Fish.

Cetaceans include approximately 84 species. They are a diverse group. They range in size from less than 1 m long for a newborn vaquita (. Phocoena sinus), to 33 m in an adult blue whale (. Balaenoptera musculus); they occupy water ranging in temperature from -2°C to over 30°C; they exhibit a diverse array of life history strategies. Consider the sperm whale (. Physeter macrocephalus), which can remain beneath the water for over an hour and dive to depths of several thousand meters; the Ganges river dolphin (. Platanista gangetica), which inhabits fresh water so turbid it is functionally blind; beaked whales of the genus Mesoplodon, which are so pelagic and so elusive that some have never been seen alive in the wild; the gray whale (. Eschrichtius robustus), which annually migrates some 15,000 to 20,000 km between breeding and feeding areas; and the bowhead whale (. Balaena mysticetus), which uses its rostrum to break ice in the Arctic. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

On average, Southern Hemisphere blue whales are larger than those in the Northern Hemisphere. The largest recorded were caught off the South Shetlands and South Georgia and were 31.7-32.6 m (104-107 ft) long. The largest recorded for the Northern Hemisphere was a 28.1-m (92-foot) female reported in whaling statistics from catches in the Davis Strait. In the North Pacific females of 26.8 m (88 ft) and 27.1 m (89 ft) have been recorded. A 190-ton female was reported taken off South Georgia in 1947; however, body weights of adults generally range from 50 to 150 tons. For maximum size descriptions, female measurements are used because female baleen whales are larger than males. Despite having being reduced greatly due to whaling, the blue whale remains a cosmopolitan species separated into populations from the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Blue whales are observed most commonly alone or in pairs; however, concentrations of 50 or more can be found spread out in areas of high productivity. Although not noted for raising their flukes when diving, approximately 18% of blue whales observed in the western North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific do so. This is an individual characteristic, and if the individual is relaxed it will generally raise its flukes high up in the air on each sounding dive. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The three blue whale fetuses on which this study was based were obtained from a whaling station in Norway during a time when blue whales were still abundant enough to support a whaling industry. The value of this text for the modern reader is that it provides a glimpse into the mechanisms of development of baleen in the largest rorqual whale, which is something that modern biologists are unlikely to be able to replicate for a long time. Tullberg's careful morphology, histology, and developmental thinking provide a coherent account of how the elaborate baleen racks develop from simple epidermal and dermal origins. The figures, which we have reproduced here, are superb and provide a rare window into the morphology of blue whale baleen at three fetal stages. The histology is excellent for its time and provides insights into the various keratin tissue phases that make up the baleen plates and bristles as well as the enigmatic Zwischensubstanz that acts as a spacer and possible shock-absorber between plates.","Balaenoptera musculus; Baleen; Blue whale; Development; Translation; Tullberg","developmental biology; histology; morphology; whale; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Bragulla, H., Fetal development of the segment-specific papillary body in the equine hoof (2003) Journal of Morphology, 258, pp. 207-224; Bragulla, H., Hirschberg, R.M., Horse hooves and bird feathers: Two model systems for studying the structure and development of highly adapted integumentary accessory organs - The role of the dermo-epidermal interface for the micro-architecture of complex epidermal structures (2003) Journal of Experimental Zoology, 298 (B), pp. 140-151; Budras, K.D., Schiel, C., Mulling, C., Horn tubules of the white line: An insufficient barrier against ascending bacterial invasion (1998) Equine Veterinary Education, 10, pp. 81-85; Demere, T.A., McGowen, M.R., Berta, A., Gatesy, J., Morphological and molecular evidence for a stepwise evolutionary transition from teeth to baleen in mysticete whales (2008) Systematic Biology, 57 (1), pp. 15-37; Homberger, D.G., The case of the cockatoo bill, horse hoof, rhinoceros horn, whale baleen, and turkey beard: The integument as a model system to explore the concepts of homology and non-homology (2001) Vertebrate functional morphology: Horizon of research in the 21st century, pp. 317-343. , H.

Previous assessments have assumed that catches and recent surveys south of 60°S recorded Antarctic blue whales, but these may have included pygmy blue whales. Here, we use ovarian corpora, which accumulate with ovulations and hence with length, to separate these subspecies. The resulting Bayesian mixture model, applied to 1,380 Northern Region (north of 52°S and 35°-180°E) and 3,844 Southern Ocean (south of 52°S) blue whales, estimated that only 0.1% (95% credibility intervals 0.0%-0.4%) of the Antarctic region blue whales were pygmy blue whales and, unexpectedly, found significantly lower lifetime ovulation counts for pygmy blue whales than for Antarctic blue whales (7.6 vs. 13.6). Over four decades, despite substantial depletion of Antarctic blue whales, there was no trend in the estimated proportion of pygmy blue whales in the Antarctic. Several lines of investigation found no evidence for sizeable numbers of pygmy blue whales in ovarian corpora data collected in the 1930s, as was previously hypothesized. © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus indica; Bayesian models; Corpora lutea; Mixture models; Statistical models; Subspecies identification; True blue whales","Bayesian analysis; biological survey; body size; geographical distribution; numerical model; statistical analysis; subspecies; whale; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus indica; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Arnold, P., Marsh, H., Heinsohn, G., The occurrence of two forms of minke whales in East Australian waters with a description of external characters and skeleton of the diminutive or dwarf form (1987) Scientific Reports of the Whales Research Institute, Tokyo, 38, pp. 1-46. , and; Best, P.B., Two allopatric forms of Bryde's whale off South Africa (1977) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (SPLL.

Fourth Avenue, Olympia, WA 98501, United States","Blue whales were widely distributed in the North Pacific prior to the primary period of modern commercial whaling in the early 1900s. Despite concentrations of blue whale catches off British Columbia and in the Gulf of Alaska, there had been few documented sightings in these areas since whaling for blue whales ended in 1965. In contrast, large concentrations of blue whales have been documented off California and Baja California and in the eastern tropical Pacific since the 1970s, but it was not known if these animals were part of the same population that previously ranged into Alaskan waters. We document 15 blue whale sightings off British Columbia and in the Gulf of Alaska made since 1997, and use identification photographs to show that whales in these areas are currently part of the California feeding population. We speculate that this may represent a return to a migration pattern that has existed for earlier periods for eastern North Pacific blue whale population. One possible explanation for a shift in blue whale use is changes in prey driven by changes in oceanographic conditions, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which coincides with some of the observed shifts in blue whale occurrence. © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Alaska; Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Canada; Movements; North Pacific; Photo-identification; Population structure","commercial activity; movement; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; photography; population structure; species occurrence; whale; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1747-1753. , and; Barlow, J., Abundance of large whales in California coastal waters: A comparison of ship surveys in 1979/80 and in 1991 (1994) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 44, pp. 399-406; Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem (2007) Fisheries Bulletin, 105, pp. 509-526. , and; Benson, A.J., Trites, A.W., Ecological effects of regime shifts in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific Ocean (2002) Fish and Fisheries, 3, pp. 95-113. , and; Brinton, E., Townsend, A., Decadal variability in abundances of the dominant euphausiid species in southern sectors of the California Current (2003) Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 50, pp. 2449-2472. , and; Brueggeman, J.J., Green, G.A., Grotedendt, R.A., Chapman, D.G., (1987) Aerial Surveys of Endangered Cetaceans and Other Marine Mammals in the Northwestern Gulf of Alaska and Southeastern Bering Sea, , http://www.ntis.gov, and.

Water properties were used to identify water masses and vertical displacement. The field cruises and numerical simulation indicated unique circulation features of the Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent within the canyon associated with the topographic features. The input of nutrients to the euphotic zone occurred sporadically as the Leeuwin Current generally suppressed upwelling, although the Perth Canyon had increased nutrient concentrations within its rims. The distribution of chlorophyll in the surface layers indicated high spatial variability, with a prevalent deep chlorophyll (and phytoplankton biomass) maximum at ~ 80 m. Depth-integrated primary production within the study region ranged from 360 to 760 mg C m- 2 d- 1, which was on average 2.5 times higher than rates measured in continental shelf and offshore waters north of the canyon. Aggregations of krill and other acoustic backscatter targets were concentrated near the head of the canyon at a range of depths, which may have been promoted by the circulation. The findings here are consistent with seasonal variations in wind and insolation, along with variations in the Leeuwin Current, influencing the seasonal changes and mesoscale features within the region, while the canyon promotes localised upwelling, and enhances both pelagic production and physical aggregation of plankton to attract the whales. Canyon processes must be combined with outside factors to allow upwelled nutrients to reach the photic zone. It is concluded that a combination of factors, rather than one factor alone, contributes favourably to the appearance of feeding blue whales in the Perth Canyon during the summer. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to develop a database of genetic sequences for future marine mammal research in addition to confirming the species identity of cetaceans and dugongs using a molecular approach. Partial sequencing of mitochondrial DNA loci was carried out in accidentally caught/stranded specimens of Spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris), Pantropical spotted dolphin/bridled dolphin (Stenella attenuata), Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), Long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), Indopacific humpbacked dolphin (Sousa chinensis), Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), Finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), Bryde’s whale (Balaenoptera edeni) and Dugong (Dugong dugon). Molecular identification of species was done by phylogenetic reconstruction of the sequences using portals GenBank and DNA Surveillance. Apart from ratifying their morphological identification, the analysis was able to distinguish specimens that otherwise, could not have been identified using conventional approaches. Phylogenetic analysis of the Sousa-Stenella-Tursiops-Delphinus group indicated more or less robust monophyly for all species in this complex, except Delphinus capensis. A sister-group relationship for Sperm whales and Baleen whales was evident, that would place the former closer to the latter than to any other group of toothed whales. © 2009, Asian Fisheries Society.

Call characteristics were compared among sites using the average pressure spectrum levels from 1 month of data at each location. Presence of calls was analyzed using automatic call detection and acoustic power analysis methods. Blue whale calls were recorded year-round, with the highest detections in February-May and November. This suggests that the blue whale population may not migrate synchronously, and may indicate long duration calls are more common during migrations. Fin whale calls were detected only during February-July. Two distinct fin whale call types were recorded, suggesting a possible separation into two populations. The calls at the EA site had a secondary frequency peak in the pressure spectrum at 99 Hz and the calls at the WAP and the SS sites had a peak at 89 Hz. No fin whale calls were detected at the RS site. Acoustics are a good tool to monitor large whales in the Southern Ocean. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Blue whale; Circumpolar; Distribution; Fin whale; Passive acoustics; Southern Ocean","acoustic method; calling behavior; geographical distribution; migration; seasonal variation; spatial variation; species occurrence; whale; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; Ross Sea; Scotia Sea; Southern Ocean; West Antarctica; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Branch, T.A., Butterworth, D.S., Estimates of abundance south of 60°S for cetacean species sighted frequently on the 1978/79 to 1997/98 IWC/IDCR-SOWER sighting surveys (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 3, pp. 251-270. , and; Branch, T.A., Matsuoka, K., Miyashita, T., Evidence for increases in Antarctic blue whales based on Bayesian modelling (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20, pp. 726-754. , and; Branch, T.A., Stafford, K.M., Palacios, D.M., Past and present distribution, densities, and movements of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean (2007) Mammal Review, 37, pp. 116-175. , and. 39. others; Brown, S.G., Dispersal in blue and fin whales (1954) Discovery Reports, 26, pp. 355-384; Brown, S.G., A note on migration of fin whales (1962) Norsk Hvalfangst-Tidende, 51, pp. 13-16; Brown, S.G., The movements of fin and blue whales within the Antarctic zone (1962) Discovery Reports, 33, pp. 1-54; Clapham, P.J., Baker, C.S., (2001) How Many Whales Were Killed in the Southern Hemisphere in the 20th Century?, , and.

Estimates of secondary and tertiary (carbon) production and daily food intake were deduced for five species of representative cetaceans for different marine habitats of the Galapagos by using associated calculations of annual primary production and carbon flux, as well as estimations of relative abundance, biomass, absolute density and trophic levels (TL) reported elsewhere. Under these premises, sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) and carnivore-generalist killer whales (Orcinus orca) for open ocean (i.e. no upwelling regions) had the lowest values of tertiary production at the top predator level (0.01-1.01 gC m-2 yr-1), while Bryde's (Balaenoptera edeni) and blue (B. musculus) whales from upwelling zone located at southwest Galapagos Island yielded the highest cetacean production (13.7 and 35.4 gC m-2 yr-1, respectively). Significant positive correlations at a 15% of efficiency transfer were found between the estimated annual primary production and tertiary production of baleen whales, and between annual primary production and tertiary production of toothed cetaceans. When both groups of cetaceans were combined a no significant correlation was observed between cetacean production and annual primary productivity. This outcome was influenced by their different trophic positions in the food chain and different scenarios values of annual primary productivity of the marine ecosystems selected. More research is needed to determine abundance, prey selection, feeding rates, and fecal matter sinking rates from marine mammals in Galapagos waters, as well as their function in the vertical carbon flux.","Baleen whales;

For collecting data on species distribution, 35 opportunistic surveys were conducted onboard FORV Sagar Sampada between October 2003 and February 2007 in the Indian EEZ and contiguous seas. In 5,254 hours of sighting effort, a total of 473 cetacean records were made with 5,865 individuals. The occurrence of 10 species from three cetacean families was confirmed. The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin was the most frequently sighted species, whereas the spinner dolphin was dominant in terms of abundance. Long-beaked common dolphins, Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin and sperm whales were also recorded at frequent intervals. Cetaceans were found to have a wide geographical distribution in the Indian EEZ and contiguous seas. High abundance and species richness were recorded in the Southeastern Arabian Sea and southern Sri Lankan waters. From the information collected during the present study, the platform of opportunity has proved to be a useful means for cetacean survey.","Blue whale; Distribution; False killer whale; Indian Eez; Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin; Indo-pacific hump-backed dolphin; Long-Beaked common dolphin; Risso'S dolphin; Short-finned pilot whale; Sperm whale; Spinner dolphin; Striped dolphin; Survey-vessel","abundance; biological survey; cetacean; dolphin; geographical distribution; spatial distribution; species inventory; species occurrence; species richness; whale; Arabian Sea; Asia; Eurasia; Indian Ocean; South Asia; Sri Lanka; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Grampus griseus; Orcinus orca; Physeteridae; Pseudorca; Stenella (Cetacea); Tursiops",,,,,,,"Ailing, A., Records of odontocetes in the northern Indian Ocean (1981-1982) and off the coast of Sri Lanka (1982-1984) (1986) J.

Four cetacean species are newly reported hosts for Xenobalanus: Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). Sightings of Xenobalanus in pelagic waters are reported for the first time, and concentrations were located within three productive zones: near the Baja California peninsula, the Costa Rica Dome and waters extending west along the 10° N Thermocline Ridge, and near Peru and the Galapagos Archipelago. Greatest prevalence was observed on blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) indicating that slow swim speeds are not necessary for effective barnacle settlement. Overall, prevalence and prevalence per sighting were generally lower than previously reported. The number of barnacles present on an individual whale was greatest for killer whales, indicating that Xenobalanus larvae may be patchily distributed. The broad geographic distribution and large number of cetacean hosts, indicate an extremely cosmopolitan distribution. A better understanding of the biology of Xenobalanus is needed before this species can be used as a biological tag.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella longirostris; Thoracica; Xenobalanus; Xenobalanus globicipitis",,,,,,,"Addink, M.J., Smeenk, C., Opportunistic feeding behavior of rough-toothed dolphins Steno bredanensis off Mauritania (2001) Zool.

Of particular interest are the Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) of the cetacean family. Massive commercial whaling prior to 1960 brought the species close to extinction and its population still remains very low. Passive acoustic monitoring of baleen whales has recently been used to provide long-term information about their presence and behavior, and provides an attractive complement to traditional visual based monitoring. In this work we present a frequency domain based algorithm developed for extracting the frequency contours of the dominant harmonic in tonal calls of blue whales (B and D calls). The algorithm uses a two pass approach to contour extraction. In the first pass, partial candidate contours are formed, followed by a second pass which uses the partial information to construct complete contours. When evaluated on a one hour labeled recording, the algorithm had 90% recall and 76% precision. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Blue whales; Contour extraction; Boolean functions",,,,,,,"Oleson, E.M., (2005) Calling behavior of blue and fin whales off California, , San Diego: University of California; Širović, A., (2006) Blue and fin whale acoustics and ecology off Antarctic Peninsula, , San Diego: University of California; Oleson, E.M., Wiggins, S.M., Hildebrand, J.A., Temporal separation of blue whale call types on a southern California feeding ground (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 881-894; Mellinger, D.K., Clark, C.W., Recognizing transient low-frequency whale sounds by spectrogram correlation (2000) The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 107, pp. 3518-3529; Berchok, C.L., Bradley, D.L., Gabrielson, T.B., St. Lawrence blue whale vocalizations revisited: Characterization of calls detected from 1998 to 2001 (2006) The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 120, pp. 2340-2354; Mellinger, D.K., Clark, C.W., Methods for automatic detection of mysticete sounds (1997) Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology, 29, pp. 163-181; Lammers, M.O., Au, W.W.L., Herzing, D.L., The broadband social acoustic signaling behavior of spinner and spotted dolphins (2003) The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 114, pp. 1629-1639; Halkias, X.C., Ellis, D.P.W., Call detection and extraction using Bayesian inference (2006) Applied Acoustics, 67, pp. 1164-1174; Talkin, D., A Robust Algorithm for Pitch Tracking (RAPT) (1995) Speech Coding and Synthesis, pp. 495-518. , W.

Catches north of 52°S were assumed to be pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda, n = 1,272); those south of 56°S were assumed to be Antarctic (true) blue whales (B. m. intermedia, n = 153). Three probable Antarctic blue whales north of 52°S were excluded. Lengths at which 50% and 95% of females become sexually mature (L50 and L 95) were estimated from a Bayesian logistic model. These estimates are more precise than previous Japanese estimates because Soviet catches below the legal minimum of 70 ft (21.3 m) were 32 times greater. For pygmy blue whales L50 was 19.2 m (95% interval 19.1-19.3 m) and L95 was 20.5 m (95% interval 20.4-20.7 m). Antarctic L50 (23.4 m, 95% interval 22.9-23.9 m) was much longer than L50 for pygmy blue whale regions (18.4-19.9 m). The median L50 for the northern Indian Ocean was 0.5-0.6 m shorter than for pygmy blue whales from other regions; although statistically significant, these small length differences provide little support for northern Indian Ocean blue whales being a separate subspecies, B. m. indica. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus indica; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Bayesian; Corpora albicantia; Corpora lutea; Illegal whaling; True blue whales","Bayesian analysis; catch statistics; data assimilation; ecological modeling; estimation method; sexual maturity; Southern Hemisphere; subspecies; whale; whaling; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus indica; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Terminology of female reproductive morphology and physiology (1984) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (6), pp. 18-22. , Anonymous.

The probability density functions of 2482 summer noise level estimates in the call bands were used to attach a probability of detection/masking to the simulated call levels as a function of whale depth and range for typical environmental conditions. Results indicate that call detection was modulated by the calling depth relative to the sound channel axis and by modal constructive and destructive interferences with range. Masking of loud infrasounds could reach 40% at 30 km for a receiver at the optimal depth. The 30 dB weaker blue whale D-call were subject to severe masking. Mapping the percentages of detection and localization allowed assessing the performance of a six-hydrophone array under mean- and low-noise conditions. This approach is helpful for optimizing hydrophone configuration in implementing passive acoustic monitoring arrays and building their detection function for whale density assessment, as an alternative to or in combination with the traditional undersampling visual methods. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustics; Detectors; Electroacoustic transducers; Functions; Hydrophones; Multitasking; Parks; Photoacoustic effect; Probability; Risk assessment; Acoustical Society of America (ASA); Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales; Channel axis; detection functions; Environmental conditioning; Hydrophone arrays; Infrasounds; Large apertures; Low noise; Marine parks; Noise levels; noise statistics; Normal modes; Ocean noise; Optimal depth; Passive acoustic detection; Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM); probability densities; Under-sampling; visual methods; Probability density function; acoustics; conference paper; environmental exposure; marine environment; noise; nonhuman; oceanic regions; priority journal; sound detection; summer; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fin Whale; Probability; Quebec; Rivers; Sound Localization; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC

The structures of recorded calls were broadly similar to those reported from other areas, but lacked the stereotypical patterning of those signals thought to represent reproductive displays. Counts of non-patterned blue whale calls indicated low vocalisation rates, with a mean of 0.62 phrases per whale per hour (0.12 A-B and 0.49 arch phrases per whale per hour). However, vocalisations were highly clustered in time, with 80% of blue whale calls ascribed to the focal animals arriving within a single 80 second period. It is not clear what behavioural, geographical or seasonal trends may influence the vocalisation rate of large baleen whales, and thus direct comparisons between areas are difficult. However, it is hoped the results presented will be of use in interpreting remote recordings of blue whales made from the North Atlantic. Hydrophones were also monitored continuously over 7,757km of trackline using an automated detection algorithm developed for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, no North Atlantic right whales were seen or heard during the study period.","Acoustics; Atlantic Ocean; Blue whale; Fin whale; North Atlantic right whale; Northern Hemisphere; Survey-acoustic; Vocalisation","acoustic survey; algorithm; behavioral ecology; detection method; hydrophone; seasonality; signaling; vocalization; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Eurasia; Europe; Greenland; Iceland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Bass, A.H., Clark, C.W., The physical acoustics of underwater sound communication (2003) Acoustic Communication: Springer Handbook of Auditory Research, pp. 15-64. , Fay, R. and Popper, A, eds, Springer-Verlag, New York; Berchok, C.L., Bradley, D.L., Gabrielson, T.B., St. Lawrence blue whale vocalizations revisited: Characterisation of calls detected from 1998 to 2001 (2006) J.

Results showed that blue whales found in the eastern Pacific off Central and North America are significantly shorter (by approximately 2m) than blue whales found at higher latitudes in the North Pacific. Results support the occurrence of a morphologically distinct eastern North Pacific (ENP) blue whale population which migrates in spring/summer from warm waters off Central America and Mexico to temperate feeding grounds along the west coast of North America. Southern Hemisphere blue whales sampled with vertical aerial photogrammetry off northern Peru and the Galapagos Islands were similar in size to the ENP blue whales. However, the population affinity of these southern blue whales remains uncertain. No length data were available for blue whales formerly captured off southern Japan and Korea. Nonetheless, a history of diminishing fishery catches and a lack of any recent sightings suggests that these whales were members of a geographic population that is now severely depleted or extinct. Based on comparisons of total length, length of rostrum and length of tail region, ENP blue whales were found to be morphologically similar to the 'pygmy' blue whale (B.m. brevicauda) described from the Kerguelen Island region of the southern Indian Ocean. 'Antarctic'blue whales (B.m. intermedia) from the Southern Ocean were found to be statistically significantly larger than their conspecifics at high latitudes in the North Pacific. These results support the hypotheses that blue whales that migrate from warm seas to cold feeding grounds in high latitudes are larger than those whose distributions are limited to low and mid-latitudes. Differences in morphology may reflect selective pressure on populations to adapt physiologically to energy demands associated with different migration, environmental and ecological regimes. As some of the results come from populations located far apart in different oceans, questions remain concerning the continuity of populations within and among ocean basins. Consequently, research using fishery data and approaches such as photogrammetry, telemetry, acoustics and molecular genetic analysis should be continued to better understand the worldwide blue whale population structure.","Blue whale; Distribution; Migration; Morphometrics; Pacific Ocean; Photo-ID; Photogrammetry; Photography; Southern Hemisphere; Southern Ocean; Survey-aerial; Whaling-historical","feeding ground; genetic analysis; geographical distribution; geographical variation; molecular analysis; morphology; morphometry; photogrammetry; population migration; Southern Hemisphere; spring (season); summer; whale; Central America; Mexico [North America]; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central); Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguayo L, A. 1974.

This paper reviews some fisheries that have taken advantage of this sensitivity by using sound to help capture numerous species of dolphins and whales. Fishermen in many parts of the world have independently developed methods that use sounds to drive (herd) various species of small cetaceans so that they can be killed and used for food, culled (i.e. to offset competition for fish), help capture fish (e.g. in the Eastern Tropical Pacific) or be taken into captivity. It is well documented that drive fisheries for small cetaceans have occurred for at least 650 years in Japan and Europe. With respect to large whales, the use of sound became widespread after World War II, with the advent of an early form of sonar (ASDIC) which was used for hunting both baleen and sperm whales. Baleen whales displayed a strong avoidance reaction to ASDIC by swimming rapidly away from the sound while remaining near the surface of the water. In contrast, sperm whales made longer dives in response to ASDIC. During the 20th Century, fishermen using these two acoustical methods killed millions of cetaceans (including those caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna fisheries), both small and large. The effectiveness of acoustic capture methods shows that a wide range of cetacean species have strong avoidance reactions to a variety of anthropogenic sounds. Research to better document the characteristics of these sounds, including those used in existing drive fisheries and those produced by ASDIC devices, would improve understanding of the types of anthropogenic sounds that could contribute to mass-stranding events and should be minimised in protected habitats for cetaceans.","Acoustics; Atlantic white-sided dolphin; Blue whale; Direct capture; False killer whale; Fraser's dolphin; Gray whale; Harbour porpoise; Hearing; Humpback whale; Killer whale; Live-capture; Long-finned pilot whale; Melon-headed whale; Northern bottlenose whale; Pacific white-sided dolphin; Pantropical dolphin; Pygmy killer whale; Risso's dolphin; Short-finned pilot whale; Small cetaceans; Sonar; Sperm whale; Stress; Striped dolphin; Whaling-historical; Whaling-modern; Whaling-small type","acoustic method; capture method; dolphin; fishery management; research; sonar; whale; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Japan; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Cucumis; Delphinidae; Eschrichtiidae; Feresa; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Globicephala melas; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Megaptera; Mysticeti; Orcinus orca; Peponocephala; Phocoenidae; Physeteridae; Pseudorca; Scombridae; Stenella (Cetacea)",,,,,,,"Akamatsu, T., Hatakeyama, Y., Takatsu, N., Effects of pulse sounds on escape behavior of false killer whales (1993) Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi -Bulletin of the Japanese Society of Scientific Fisheries, 59 (8), pp. 1297-1303; Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea.

Since this time, there have been a few summer time visual surveys for these species, but no overview of year-round use of these waters by endangered whales primarily because standard visual survey data are difficult and costly. From October 1999-May 2002, moored hydrophones were deployed in six locations in the GoA to record whale calls. Reception of calls from fin, humpback, and blue whales and an unknown source, called Watkins' whale, showed seasonal and geographic variation. Calls were detected more often during the winter than during the summer, suggesting that animals inhabit the GoA year-round. To estimate the distance at which species-diagnostic calls could be heard, parabolic equation propagation loss models for frequencies characteristic of each of each call type were run. Maximum detection ranges in the subarctic North Pacific ranged from 45 to 250 km among three species (fin, humpback, blue), although modeled detection ranges varied greatly with input parameters and choice of ambient noise level. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Climate change; Fish; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Seawater; Ambient noise level; Frequencies characteristics; Standard visual surveys; Acoustic noise measurement; article; balaeno borealis; balaeno musculus; balaeno physalus; controlled study; environmental temperature; eubalaena japonica; frequency analysis; geographical variation (species); geography; Gulf stream; megaptera novoeangliae; noise; nonhuman; parameter; priority journal; seasonal variation; sound detection; species; United States; whale; winter; Acoustics; Alaska; Animals; Balaenoptera; Computer Simulation; Echolocation; Fin Whale; Humpback Whale; Models, Biological; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Seasons; Seawater; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean, JISAO

Concurrently, the development of several types of autonomous underwater vehicles has demonstrated measurement capabilities that promise to revolutionize ocean science. These two lines of technical development were merged with the addition of broadband (5 Hz to 30 kHz) omni-directional hydrophones to seagliders. In August 2006, the capability of three Acoustic Seagliders (ASGs) to detect whale calls was tested in an experiment offshore Monterey, California. In total, 401 dives were completed and over 107 hours of acoustic data recorded. Blue whale calls were detected on all but two of the 76 dives where acoustic data were analyzed in detail, while humpback and sperm whale calls were detected on roughly 20% of those dives. Various whistles, clicks and burst calls, similar to those produced by dolphins and small whales, were also detected, suggesting that the capability of ASGs can be expanded to sample a broad range of marine mammal species. The potential to include whale call detection in the suite of standard oceanographic measures is unprecedented and provides a foundation for mobile sampling strategies at scales that better match the vertical and horizontal movements of the whales themselves. This capability opens new doors for investigation of cetacean habitats and their role in marine ecosystems, as envisioned in future ocean observing systems.",,"Acoustic data; Blue whale; California; Horizontal movements; Long-term sampling; Marine ecosystem; Marine mammals; Ocean observing systems; Ocean science; Omni-directional; Sampling strategies; Seagliders; Sperm Whales; Technical development; Two-line; Whale calls; Acoustics; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Ecosystems; Electroacoustic transducers; Mammals; Signaling; Submersibles; Underwater equipment; Water craft; Oceanography; acoustic data; autonomous underwater vehicle; bioacoustics; broadband data; calling behavior; detection method; dolphin; hydrophone; long-term change; marine ecosystem; movement; oceanography; offshore application; sampling; sperm; technological development; whale; California; Monterey; North America; United States; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Taylor, B.L., Estimates of sperm whale abundance in the northeastern temperate Pacific from a combined acoustic and visual survey (2005) Mar Mammal Sci., 21, pp. 429-445; Baumgartner, M.F., Fratantoni, D.M., Clark, C.W., Investigating baleen whale ecology with simultaneous oceanographic and acoustic observations from autonomous underwater vehicles (2006) EOS Transactions, AGU, 87 (36). , Abstract OS24E-05, Honolulu, HI.

We made 13 successful deployments (defined as tag duration of >15 min and successful recovery of the tag and data) totaling 19 hours of CRITTERCAMs on blue whales off California and in the Sea of Cortez from spring through fall (26 February to 30 September) between 1999 and 2003 . Whale diving depth and behavior varied widely by region and period, although deployments on different individuals in the same area and period often showed very similar feeding behavior. One deployment extending into night showed a diurnal shift in diving behavior with progressively shallower feeding dives as it became dark, with shift to shallow, apparently non-feeding dives during the night. Data and video from tags demonstrated that the characteristic series of vertical movements blue whales make at depth are lunges into dense aggregations of krill. These krill were visible streaming by the camera immediately before these lunges and more clearly when the whales' forward motion stopped as a result of the lunge. The progression of events leading up to and during the lunge could be documented from the head movement of whales and occasional views of the expanding throat pleats or lower jaw, and by changes in flow noise past the tag, indicating a rapid deceleration. One set of deployments in the Southern California Bight revealed consistent feeding at depths of 250-300 m, deeper than has been previously reported for blue whales. A loud blue whale vocalization was heard on only one deployment on a male blue whale in an interacting trio of animals.",,"Blue whale; Blue whale vocalizations; California; Diving behavior; Feeding behavior; Flow noise; Head movements; Southern California Bight; Vertical movement; Video imaging; Animals; Feeding; Underwater imaging; calling behavior; diurnal variation; diving; feeding behavior; shallow water; soil aggregate; suction; underwater camera; vertical movement; whale; Gulf of California; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Euphausiacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D., Tershy, B., Feeding costs limit dive time in Large whales (2002) J Exp Biol., 205, pp. 1747-1753; Baird, R.W., Hanson, B.M., Dill, L.W., Factors influencing the diving behaviour of fish-eating killer whales: Sex differences and diel and interannual variation in diving rates (2005) Can J Zool., 83, pp. 257-267; Baird, R.W., Webster, D.L., McSweeney, D.J., Ligon, A.D., Schorr, G.S., Barlow, J., Diving behaviour of cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) in Hawai'i (2006) Can J Zool., 84, pp. 1120-1128; Barlow, J., Abundance of large whales in California coastal waters: A comparison of ship surveys in 1979/80 and in 1991 (1994) Rep Int Whal Comm., 44, pp. 399-406; Burtenshaw, J.C., Oleson, E.M., Hildebrand, J.A., McDonald, M.A., Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Acoustic and satellite remote sensing of blue whale seasonality and habitat in the Northeast Pacific (2004) Deep-Sea Res Pt II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 51, pp. 967-986; Calambokidis, J., Barlow, J., Abundance of blue and humpback whales in the eastern North Pacific estimated by capture-recapture and line-transect methods (2004) Mar Mammal Sci., 20, pp. 63-85; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Cubbage, J.C., Balcomb, K.C., Ewald, C., Kruse, S., Wells, R., Sears, R., Sightings and movements of blue whales off central California 198688 from photoidentification of individuals (1990) Rep Int Whal Comm., (SPEC.

To estimate the proportions of these two subspecies in various regions, Bayesian mixture models were fitted to catch length frequencies of sexually mature females. The extent of rounding to 5-ft intervals was also estimated. Antarctic blue whales dominated (99.2%) pelagic catches south of 52°S, whereas pygmy blue whales dominated (99.9%) north of 52°S and in 35°-180°E. South of 60°S, only 0.7% (95% credibility interval 0.5%-1.0%) were pygmy blue whales, lower than the 7% upper bound currently assumed. Shore-based catches from SW Africa and those before 1937 from South Georgia and the South Shetlands were estimated to contain 90%-92% Antarctic blue whales. Actual proportions were probably higher, but these data show evidence of rounding (up to 19% of records), poor length-estimation methods, and other problems. The mean length of sexually mature female Chilean blue whales (77.1 ft, 23.5 m) was intermediate between pygmy (68.9 ft, 21.0 m) and Antarctic blue whales (83.4-86.3 ft, 25.4-26.6 m). A good fit to these data was obtained only by assuming that the Chilean whales are a separate subspecies or distinctive population. This finding is also consistent with their discrete distribution, and genetic and call type differences, compared to Antarctic and pygmy blue whales. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","B. m. brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Bayesian; Blue whale; Jackknife analysis; Length frequencies; Mixture models; Subspecies","population distribution; population estimation; sexual maturity; subspecies; whale; Antarctica; South Georgia; South Shetland Islands; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguayo, L.A., Baleen whales off continental Chile (1974) The Whale Problem: A Status Report., pp. 209-217. , Pages. in.

These migratory movements have been confirmed through acoustic monitoring of the long-duration, low-frequency sounds produced by males (type B calls). However, other calls in the species' repertoire might prove a better proxy for the migratory and foraging behaviour of the population as a whole. To explore the seasonal and daily calling behaviour of this population, we evaluated the occurrence of three blue whale call types (song B, singular B and D) recorded between 2000 and 2004 at Cortez and Tanner Banks, a summer feeding area offshore of southern California. We recorded a significant temporal separation among the type B and D calls, both seasonally and daily, suggesting preferred use of certain call types during different behavioural states. A consistent seasonal pattern was evident, with D calling from April to November and song and singular B calling from June to January. In addition, D calls were heard primarily from dawn through to dusk, in contrast to the crepuscular pattern of song, suggesting that the production of D calls is related to feeding behaviour, which occurs primarily during the day on aggregated krill at depth. An increase in the length of the overall calling season was also observed from 2000 to 2004 and may be related to increased prey availability in the Southern California Bight relative to more southerly feeding areas. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic communication; Balaenoptera musculus; blue whale; foraging; song; song repertoire; vocal communication","acoustic method; feeding ground; foraging behavior; migratory behavior; prey availability; song; temporal analysis; whale; California; North America; United States; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea",,,,,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, SERDP

The source levels of blue and fin whale calls off the Western Antarctic Peninsula were calculated using recordings made with calibrated, bottom-moored hydrophones. Blue whales were located up to a range of 200 km using hyperbolic localization and time difference of arrival. The distance to fin whales, estimated using multipath arrivals of their calls, was up to 56 km. The error in range measurements was 3.8 km using hyperbolic localization, and 3.4 km using multipath arrivals. Both species produced high-intensity calls; the average blue whale call source level was 189±3 dB re:1 μPa - 1 m over 25-29 Hz, and the average fin whale call source level was 189±4 dB re:1 μPa - 1 m over 15-28 Hz. Blue and fin whale populations in the Southern Ocean have remained at low numbers for decades since they became protected; using source level and detection range from passive acoustic recordings can help in calculating the relative density of calling whales. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Audio recordings; Fish; Frequency estimation; Hydrophones; Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales; Hyperbolic localization; Passive acoustic recordings; Bioelectric potentials; acoustics; analytic method; animal communication; animal experiment; article; Balaenoptera musculus; balaenoptera physalus; controlled study; feeding; frequency analysis; mating; nonhuman; priority journal; sea; sound; sound detection; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Animals, Wild; Antarctic Regions; Balaenoptera; Fin Whale; Models, Biological; Population Density; Seawater; Sound Localization; Species Specificity; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"OPP 05-23349, OPP 99-10007","This work was supported by National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Grants OPP 99-10007 and OPP 05-23349 as part of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program, with program guidance by Polly Penhale, Roberta Martinelli, and Marie Bundy.

Palazzetta 68, Paciano (PG) 06060, Italy","It is argued that Japan's authorities and entrepreneurs involved in whaling and the whale-meat trade have a long-term goal of rebuilding a large and profitable industry of pelagic whaling, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, in the next 20 years or so. They have made large investments in this enterprise since the so-called moratorium on commercial whaling was adopted by the International Whaling Commission in 1982. These include, but are not confined to, state subsidizing of an expanding and diversifying 20-year programme of commercial whaling under provisions in all relevant international agreements since 1937 that permit unlimited and unilaterally decreed whaling, supposedly for scientific purposes, provided that the commodities from the whales killed are fully utilized. The context of this is the monopoly of technical knowledge, special skills and the market for valuable whale-meat that Japanese enterprises acquired in the post-world war II period, having broken - in 1937 - the strongly defended de facto Anglo-Norwegian monopoly of technology, skills, access to Antarctic whaling grounds and the market for whale-oil that had existed until then. The attraction of 'scientific whaling' is not only that it by-passes any internationally agreed catch-limits but that it also circumvents all other rules - many dating fr/om the League of Nations whaling convention of 1931 - regarding protected species, closed areas, killing of juveniles, less inhumane killing methods, etc. The groundwork is being laid to justify that resumed whaling on partially recovered whale stocks will be at the unsustainable levels that will be profitable again. This justification is based on spurious assertions that numerous and hungry whales threaten the world's fisheries, and that the abundance and possible increase in some whale species is impeding the recovery of other, severely depleted, and potentially more valuable species such as the blue whale. If the scenario presented here is correct it has important implications for attempts by the international community either to bring a negotiated end to commercial whaling or to bring all whaling back under international control, as the international law of the sea requires, and to ensure that any permitted exploitation of recovered whale populations will be sustainable, under a precautionary regime. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Encounter rates were estimated using temporal, geographic, and weather variables within a generalized additive model framework. Visual encounters (2.06 animals/h, CV = 0.10) varied with subregion, Julian day, time of day, and year. Acoustic encounters of whales producing pulsed A and tonal B call sequences (song; 0.65 animals/h, CV = 0.06) varied by Julian day, survey mode (transit or stationary), and subregion, and encounters of whales producing downswept (D) calls (0.41 animals/h, CV = 0.09) varied by Julian day and the number of animals seen. Inclusion of Julian day in all models reflects the seasonal occurrence of blue whales off southern California; however, the seasonal peak in visual encounters and acoustic encounters of D calling whales (July-August) was offset from the peak in acoustic encounters of singing whales (August-September). The relationship between visual and acoustic encounter rates varied regionally, with significant differences in several northern regions. The number of whales heard D calling was positively related to the number of animals seen, whereas the number of singing whales was not related to visual encounter rate. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic survey; Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Encounter rate; Feeding ground; Visual survey","acoustic survey; calling behavior; encounter rate; feeding ground; seasonal variation; visual analysis; whale; Pacific Ocean; Southern California Bight; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1747-1753. , and; Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory., pp. 267-281. , Pages. in.

Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common bottle-nosed dolphin neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalu) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales. Similar structures were present in the corresponding cardiac tissues of neonatal Hippopotamidae. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Fetus; Heart; Hippopotamidae; Mysticeti; Neonate; Odontoceti; Whale","anatomical variation; animal tissue; article; Balaena mysticetus; balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; comparative anatomy; controlled study; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinus delphis; dolphin; fetus; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; heart atrium septum; heart foramen ovale; heart ventricle septum; Hyperoodon ampullatus; killer whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; microscopic anatomy; Monodon monoceros; Neophocoena phocoenoides; newborn; nonhuman; Phocoena phocoena; porpoise; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; species comparison; species difference; tursiops truncatus; whale; Animals; Cetacea; Common Dolphins; Female; Heart Septum; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Porpoises; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hippopotamidae; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Monodontidae; Mysticeti; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Odontoceti; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Amoroso, E.C., Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., Prichard, M.M.L., The bifurcation of the posterior caval channel in the eutherian foetal heart (1942) J Anat, 76, pp. 240-247; (2005) Out of the Blue: The UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme, , History Museum London; Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 333, pp. 27-34; Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., The time of functional closure of the foramen ovale in the lamb (1938) J Physiol, 94, pp. 256-258; Bartholin, T., (1654) Historiarum Anatomicarum Rariorum Centuriae II; Historia XXV, , Amstelodami; Beauregard, H., Boulart, R., Recherches anatomiques sur les Balænides (1897) Nouv Arch Mus Hist Nat Paris 3rd Ser, 9, pp. 95-112; Boisserie, J.R., The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): A review based on morphology and cladistic analysis (2005) Zool J Linn Soc, 143, pp. 1-26; Boyd, I.L., Lockyer, C., Marsh, H.D., Reproduction in marine mammals (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 218-286. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Burmeister, G., Descripcion de cuatro especies de delfinides de la costa Argentina en el océano atlántico (1869) An Mus Nac Hist Nat B Aires, 1, pp. 367-442; Butler, P.J., Metabolic regulation in diving birds and mammals (2004) Resp Physiol Neurobiol, 141, pp. 297-315; Cohen, A.L., Critical point drying principles and procedures (1979) Scanning Electron Microscopy, 1979 (2), pp. 303-323; Echlin, P., Splutter coating techniques for scanning electron microscopy (1975) Scanning Electron Microsc, 1975 (2), pp. 217-224; Edelstone, D.I., Rudolph, A.M., Preferential streaming of ductus venosus blood to the brain and heart in fetal lambs (1979) Am J Physiol, 237, pp. H724-H729; Elsner, R., Living in water: Solutions to physiological problems (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 73-116. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Eschricht, D.F., (1837) De Organis, Quae Respirationi Et Nutritioni Foetus Mammalium Inserviunt, , Hafniae: JH Schultz; Eschricht, D.F., Zoologisch-anatomisch-physiologische Untersuchungen über die nordischen Walthiere (1849), L.

J4P 1T3, Canada","Understanding the factors influencing habitat selection is critical to improving management and conservation plans for large whales. Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies.

At least forty expeditions of whaling vessels from European and American ports visited the area. In all cases the main target was the sperm whale, but pilot whales, dolphins, sea turtles, and even a blue whale were also taken. Whaling effort concentrated on the Atlantic side of the Straits; only two expeditions ventured into the Mediterranean Sea, obtaining negligible catches. The whaling season extended during spring and summer and peaked in June-July. This seasonality appeared not to be governed by changes in whale density but by the trade winds necessary to sail southward or westward to cross the Atlantic. Searching effort continued while trying out, but the rate of sighting cetaceans was about half that of searching periods. However, the rate of sighting or capturing a sperm whale remained unchanged during processing, probably because the gregarious habits of the species produced clumping of catches. For every whale secured, 1.31 whales were struck. After correcting for struck but lost whales and for ""gammed"" vessels, the minimum number of removals of sperm whales during 1862-1889 is estimated at 237. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Exploitation; Mediterranean Sea; Open-boat whaling; Physeter macrocephalus; Sperm whale; Straits of Gibraltar; Whale fishery; Whaling; Whaling history","catch composition; dolphin; exploitation; fishing vessel; population density; seasonality; turtle; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea; Strait of Gibraltar; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Cheloniidae; Delphinidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Testudines",,,,,,,"ACCOBAMS. 2003.

Approximately one-third of 38 monitored blue whales vocalized, with sounds categorized into 3 types: (1) low-frequency pulsed A and tonal B calls, in either rhythmic repetitive song sequences or as intermittent, singular calls; (2) downswept D calls; and (3) highly variable amplitude-or frequency-modulated calls. Clear patterns of behavior, sex, and group size are evident for some call types. Only males were documented producing AB calls, with song produced by lone, traveling blue whales, and singular AB calls were more typically produced by whales in pairs; D calls were heard from both sexes during foraging, commonly from individuals within groups. The sex bias evident in AB callers suggests that these calls probably play a role in reproduction, even though the calls are produced year-round. All calls are produced at shallow depth, and calling whales spend more time at shallow depths than non-calling whales, suggesting that a cost may be incurred during D calling, as less time is spent feeding at deeper depths. This relationship between calling and depth may predict the traveling behavior of singing blue whales, as traveling whales do not typically dive to deep depths and therefore would experience little extra energetic cost related to the production of long repetitive song bouts while moving between foraging areas. © Inter-Research 2007.","Acoustics; Blue whale; Calls; Foraging; Sex bias; Suction-cup tag","bioacoustics; calling behavior; foraging behavior; group size; sex determination; whale; California; North America; United States; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) J Exp Biol, 205, pp. 1747-1753; Aroyan, J.L., McDonald, M.A., Webb, S.C., Hildebrand, J.A., Clark, D.S., Laitman, J.T., Reidenberg, J.S., Acoustic models of sound production and propagation (2000) Hearing by whales and dolphins, pp. 409-469. , Au WWL, Popper AN, Fay RN eds, Springer-Verlag, New York, p; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principle of animal communication, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA; Brinton, E., Vertical migration and avoidance capability of eupahusiids in the California Current (1967) Limnol Oceanogr, 12, pp. 451-483; Burtenshaw, J.C., Oleson, E.M., McDonald, M.A., Hildebrand, J.A., Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Acoustic and satellite remote sensing of blue whale seasonality and habitat in the Northeast Pacific (2004) Deep-Sea Res II, 51, pp. 967-986; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Cubbage, J.C., Balcomb, K.C., Ewald, E., Kruse, S., Wells, R., Sears, R., Sightings and movements of blue whales off central California 1986-88 from photo-identification of individuals (1990) Rep Int Whal Commn Spec Issue, 12, pp. 343-348; Cato, D.H., Songs of humpback whales: The Australian perspective (1991) Mem Queensl Mus, 30, pp. 227-290; Clapham, P.J., The social and reproductive biology of humpback whales: An ecological perspective (1996) Mammal Rev, 26, pp. 27-49; Clapham, P.J., Matilla, D.K., Humpback whale songs as indicators of migration routes (1990) Mar Mamm Sci, 6, pp. 155-160; Clark CW (1983) Acoustic communication and behavior of the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis).

Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic ('true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and highsighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860-2900) in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3% per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4-11.6%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales. © 2007 The Authors.

This is the most important collection existing in Italy for the number of taxa being included (27), seven of them being the sole present in Italian museums. Noteworthy are the skeletons of some large size species, among which the Blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus) and the Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis ) are the sole complete ones existing in Italy in addition to the adults of the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the Northern right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis). The collection must also be appreciated for several exotic species. The 53 skeletons here stored were mostly acquired during the XIX Century, thanks to prof. Sebastiano Richiardi, director of the Institute from 1871 to 1904, and increased from his successor, prof. Eugenio Ficalbi from 1905 to1922. This catalogue has been compiled throughout a long term study begun in 1984 and concluded only several years later, after the transfer of the collection to its present seat: as a matter of fact, an accurate revision of the conditions of the specimens was essential after the move and the final layout. At the same time, a wide documental research was run on the archivial historical sources, concerning the acquisition of the specimens, with many original information on the long history of the building of the collection; detailed data on the costs of several purchasing contracts are also reported. The catalogue lists each specimen in systematic order, with its taxonomic references and description of the fundamental osteometrical parameters. Specific bibliography concerning every specimen of the collection is also shown. © 2007, Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali.

Studies aimed at elaborating oceanographic mechanisms within the canyon were conducted between 2002 and 2005. Strings of temperature loggers set around the canyon rim were used to examine the water column's response to climatological forcing, current meanders, upwelling and downwelling. Six moorings were positioned on a plateau in 500 m of water on the northern canyon rim, and one was positioned at the canyon head. Loggers were positioned to sample the whole water column, including the Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent. Moorings revealed spatial temperature differences between the plateau and canyon head. Observed temperature features ranged temporally from seasonal to <1 day. Seasonal changes in water temperature agreed with published Leeuwin Current studies: for example, mixed layer and stratification changes were apparent. Other observed temperature changes were related to Leeuwin Current movement and wind forcing such as the summer sea breeze and winter storms. Storms induced mixing, re-stratification, downwelling and upwelling as the wind changed direction and strength. Changes lasting a day were associated with diurnal sea breezes, internal waves and possibly solitary waves. Bottom loggers indicated that upwelling and downwelling events each occurred up to 20% of the time. © CSIRO 2006.","Stratification; Submarine canyons; Temperature measurement","canyon; current; thermal structure; undercurrent; upwelling; Australasia; Australia; Indian Ocean; Perth Canyon; Western Australia; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Ardhuin, F., Pinot, J.M., Tintoré, J., Numerical study of the circulation in a steep canyon off the Catalan coast (western Mediterranean) (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104 (C5), pp. 11115-11135. , doi:10.1029/1999JC900029; Bosley, K.L., Lavelle, J.W., Brodeur, R.D., Wakefield, W.W., Emmett, R.L., Baker, E.T., Rehmke, K.M., Biological and physical processes in and around Astoria submarine Canyon, Oregon, USA (2004) Journal of Marine Systems, 50, pp. 21-37. , doi:10.1016/J.JMARSYS.2003.06.006; Carter, G.S., Gregg, M.C., Intense, variable mixing near the head of Monterey Submarine Canyon (2002) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 32 (11), pp. 3145-3165. , doi:10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032〈3145:IVMNTH〉2.0.CO;2; Cresswell, G.R., The Leeuwin Current near Rottnest Island, Western Australia (1996) Marine and Freshwater Research, 47, pp. 483-487. , doi:10.1071/MF9960483; Cresswell, G.R., Griffin, D.A., The Leeuwin Current, eddies and sub-Antarctic waters off south-western Australia (2004) Marine and Freshwater Research, 55, pp. 267-276. , doi:10.1071/MF03115; Feng, M., Meyers, G., Pearce, A.F., Wijffels, S., Annual and interannual variations of the Leeuwin Current at 32°S (2003) Journal of Geophysical Research, 108, pp. C11. , 3355; Fieux, M., Molcard, R., Morrow, R., Water properties and transport of the Leeuwin Current and Eddies off Western Australia (2005) Deep-Sea Research.

Morphometric data from whaling records and recent stranding events were compiled, and morphometric parameters describing the body length, and fluke and flipper dimensions for an ""average"" blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, and right whale Eubalaena glacialis were determined. Body mass, body volume, body surface area, and fluke and flipper surface areas were estimated. The resultant morphological configurations lent themselves to the following classifications based on hydrodynamic principles: fast cruiser, slow cruiser, fast maneuverer, and slow maneuverer. Blue whales have highly stream-lined bodies with small, high aspect ratio flippers and flukes for fast efficient cruising in the open ocean. On the other hand, the rotund right whale has large, high aspect ratio flukes for efficient slow speed cruising that is optimal for their continuous filter feeding technique. Humpbacks have large, high aspect ratio flippers and a large, low aspect ratio tail for quick acceleration and high-speed maneuvering which would help them catch their elusive prey, while gray whales have large, low aspect ratio flippers and flukes for enhanced low-speed maneuvering in complex coastal water habitats. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cetacean; Feeding ecology; Functional morphology; Mysticete; Swim performance","adaptation; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; feeding behavior; histology; locomotion; physiology; predation; swimming; whale; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Locomotion; Models, Anatomic; Predatory Behavior; Swimming; Whales; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; Andrews, R.C., Notes upon the external and internal anatomy of Balaena glacialis Bonn (1908) Bull Am Mus Nat Hist, 24, pp. 171-182; Andrews, R.C., Monograph of the pacific cetacean California gray whale (1914) Mem Am Mus Nat Hist, 1, pp. 229-287; Benke, H., Investigations on the osteology and functional morphology of the flipper of whales and dolphins (Cetacea) (1993) Investig Cetacea, 24, pp. 9-252; Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (SPEC.

J4P 1T3, Canada","Blue whales in eastern Canadian waters are regarded as endangered, mainly due to the lack of knowledge on their abundance and life parameters. Here, we analysed sighting histories of 362 photo-identified blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence over 24 yr to estimate, for the first time, the adult survival rate of this species. The results revealed that some whales have high site fidelity while others are only visitors to the St. Lawrence. Low sighting reliability of transient whales resulted in an age structure for which there is no obvious biological justification and led us to discard the data set with all blue whales. Based on sighting records of individuals of known sex, we consider the best estimate for adult blue whale survival to be 0.975 (95% CI 0.960 to 0.985). This estimate is likely to be biased upwards by long-term records of individuals first sighted in the 1980s and sexed from biopsy samples in the 1990s, but biased downwards by emigration from the study area. The relative magnitude of these biases is, at present, unquantifiable. Trap dependency affects the probability of capture and varies between the sexes, but no significant difference in survival was found between the sexes. © Inter-Research 2006.","Blue whale; Modelling transients;

As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with <1 % of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models. © Inter-Research 2006.","Distribution; GIS; Global; Habitat suitability modeling; Marine mammals; Niche model; Relative environmental suitability","cetacean; environmental modeling; habitat use; mapping; marine ecosystem; pinniped; population distribution; range expansion; taxonomy; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Angel, M.V., Long-term, large-scale patterns in marine pelagic systems (1992) Proceedings of the 34th Symposium of the British Ecological Society with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, pp. 377-402. , Giller PS, Hildrew AG, Raffaelli DG (eds) Aquatic ecology: scale, pattern and process.

Muscle samples were collected from 12 polar bears, 15 ringed seals, 10 hooded seals, 7 bearded seals, 14 harp seals, one walrus, one white whale and one blue whale in the period 2000-2003. The mean concentrations (± SD) of 137Cs were: 0.72 ± 0.62 Bq/kg wet weight (w.w.) for polar bears; 0.49 ± 0.07 Bq/kg w.w. for ringed seals; 0.25 ± 0.10 Bq/kg w.w. for hooded seals; 0.22 ± 0.11 Bq/kg w.w. for bearded seals; 0.36 ± 0.13 Bq/kg w.w. for harp seals; 0.67 Bq/kg w.w. for the white whale sample; 0.24 Bq/kg w.w. for the blue whale; and below detection limit for the walrus. Significant differences in 137Cs specific activities between some of the species were found. Ringed seals had higher specific activities than the other seal species in the study. Bearded seals and hooded seals had similar values, which were both significantly lower than the harp seal values. The results in the present study are consistent with previous reported results, indicating low specific activities of 137Cs in Arctic marine mammals in the Barents Sea and Greenland Sea region during the last 20 years. The species specific differences found may be explained by varying diet or movement and distribution patterns between species. No age related patterns were found in specific activities for the two species (polar bears and hooded seals) for which sufficient data was available. Concentration factors (CF) of 137Cs from seawater were determined for polar bears, ringed, bearded, harp and hooded seals. Mean CF values ranged from 79 ± 32 (SD) for bearded seals sampled in 2002 to 244 ± 36 (SD) for ringed seals sampled in 2003 these CF values are higher than those reported for fish and benthic organisms in the literature, suggesting bioaccumulation of 137Cs in the marine ecosystem. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although several phylogenetic hypotheses about these taxa have been proposed, their phylogenetic relationships remain confused. We addressed this problem using short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) insertion data, which now are regarded as almost ideal shared, derived characters at the molecular level. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of baleen whales by characterizing 36 informative SINE loci. One of the intriguing conclusions is that balaenopterids and eschrichtiids radiated very rapidly during a very short evolutionary period. During this period, speciation occurred in balaenopterids and eschrichtiids while newly inserted SINE loci remains polymorphic. Later on, these SINEs were sorted incompletely into each lineage. Thus, there are now inconsistencies among species regarding the presence or absence of a given SINE. This is in sharp contrast to the phylogeny of toothed whales, for which no SINE inconsistencies have been found. Furthermore, we found monophyletic groupings between humpback and fin whales as well as between (sei + Bryde's) whales and blue whales, both of which have not previously been recognized. The comprehensive SINE insertion data, together with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny that was recently completed (Sasaki, T., M. Nikaido, H. Healy et al. 2005.

The eastern tropical Pacific supports on the order of 50 species of seabirds and 30 species of cetaceans as regular residents; these include four endemic species, the world's largest populations for several others, three endemic sub-species, and a multi-species community that is relatively unique to this ecosystem. Three of the meso-scale physical features of the region are particularly significant to seabirds and cetaceans: the Costa Rica Dome for blue whales and short-beaked common dolphins, the Equatorial Front for planktivorous seabirds, and the countercurrent thermocline ridge for flocking seabirds that associate with mixed-species schools of spotted and spinner dolphins and yellowfin tuna. A few qualitative studies of meso- to macro-scale distribution patterns have indicated that some seabirds and cetaceans have species-specific preferences for surface currents. More common are associations with distinct water masses; these relationships have been quantified for a number of species using several different analytical methods. The mechanisms underlying tropical species-habitat relationships are not well understood, in contrast to a number of higher-latitude systems. This may be due to the fact that physical variables have been used as proxies for prey abundance and distribution in species-habitat research in the eastern tropical Pacific. Though seasonal and interannual patterns tend to be complex, species-habitat relationships appear to remain relatively stable over time, and distribution patterns co-vary with patterns of preferred habitat for a number of species. The interactions between seasonal and interannual variation in oceanographic conditions with seasonal patterns in the biology of seabirds and cetaceans may account for some of the complexity in species-habitat relationship patterns. Little work has been done to investigate effects of El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycles on cetaceans, and results of the few studies focusing on oceanic seabirds are complex and not easy to interpret. Although much has been made of the detrimental effects of El Niño events on apex predators, more research is needed to understand the magnitude, and even direction, of these effects on seabirds and cetaceans in space and time. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixteen species were represented in this count, including: minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (1 single stranding), sei whale, B. borealis (1 single stranding), blue whale, B. musculus (1 single stranding), humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (2 single strandings), giant sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (18 single strandings, 2 pair strandings), pygmy sperm whale, Kogia breviceps (5 single strandings), dwarf sperm whale, K. sima (2 single strandings, 1 triple stranding), Blainville's beaked whale, Mesoplodon densirostris (2 single strandings), short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus (4 strandings, 56 individuals), melon-headed whale, Peponocephala electra (1 single stranding and 2 mass strandings totalling 231 individuals), common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (1 single stranding), spinner dolphin, Stenella longirostris (1 pair stranding and 2 mass strandings of groups of ∼30 individuals each), Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus (2 single strandings), dugong, Dugong dugon (14 single strandings), and New Zealand fur seal, Arctocephalus forsteri (3 single strandings). A stranded rorqual identified as an Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), with coloration patterns that did not match known descriptions, was also reported. Sei whale was recorded for the first time in the tropical Southwest Pacific region and Antarctic minke whale, melon-headed whale, and Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin were recorded for the first time in New Caledonia. Strandings of sperm whales were most frequent in the spring, but also occurred in autumn months, suggesting a seasonal pattern of occurrence possibly related to seasonal migration. One stranded humpback whale bore the scars of a killer whale's attack and one dugong was injured by a shark. Scars left by propellers were noted on several stranded animals including one Antarctic minke whale, one pygmy sperm whale, one dwarf sperm whale, and four dugongs. Collisions with vessels were suspected to be a frequent cause of death for dugong. To cite this article: P. Borsa, C. R.

Here, telemetry data from sixteen satellite-tagged blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and sea turtles (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Lepidochelys olivacea) are employed to characterize 'biologically relevant' SST fronts off Baja California Sur. High residence times are used to identify presumed foraging areas, and SST gradients are calculated across advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images of these regions. The resulting values are compared to classic definitions of SST fronts in the oceanographic literature. We find subtle changes in surface temperature (between 0.01 and 0.10 °C/km) across the foraging trajectories, near the lowest end of the oceanographic scale (between 0.03 and 0.3 °C/km), suggesting that edge-detection algorithms using gradient thresholds >0.10 °C/km may overlook pelagic habitats in tropical waters. We use this information to sensitize our edge-detection algorithm, and to identify persistent concentrations of subtle SST fronts in the Northeast Pacific Ocean between 2002 and 2004. The lower-gradient threshold increases the number of fronts detected, revealing more potential habitats in different places than we find with a higher-gradient threshold. This is the expected result, but it confirms that pelagic habitat can be overlooked, and that the temperature gradient parameter is an important one. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We deeply appreciate the shared tagging and tracking efforts of Jeffrey Seminoff, Hoyt Peckham, Louise Brooks, Grupo Tortuguero, and Seaturtle.org, and we wish them continued success with this unique community outreach effort in Baja California. Funding for sea turtle tracking was from Wallace Research Foundation, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Funding for blue whale tracking was from the Office of Naval Research contract #9310834 and from donors to the Oregon State University endowed Marine Mammal Program. Dave Foley of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory contributed the stunning image of temperature gradients observed in Coastwatch SST off BC Peninsula. Maria Montoreano graciously assisted with the preparation of the manuscript while mothering Clara Lynn Etnoyer, to whom the manuscript is dedicated. Drs.

Operational monitoring and mitigation protocols were implemented throughout the exercise to reduce the chances of an acoustic impact on marine mammals and sea turtles. The operational schedule did not include intentional ""control"" periods without transmissions but did include periods when the LFA sonar was not operating for other reasons (e.g., repairs). There were insufficient detections of blue whales for further analysis. Fin whale acoustic detection probabilities were calculated from the postprocessed data. A local-linear-regression analysis was used to compare fin whale detection probabilities from 2065 11-min intervals under conditions when the LFA sonar was and was not transmitting. There was an indication of a slightly higher probability of detecting fin whale sounds during periods when there were no LFA transmissions than during periods with transmissions. This may be the result of the following: 1) Reduced vocal activity by whales in response to LFA transmissions; 2) the effect of the mitigation protocols; or 3) some combination of 1) and 2). The data presently available do not allow one to distinguish definitively between these explanations, mainly because there were not enough data recorded for periods without LFA transmissions. © 2006 IEEE.","Acoustic detection; Fin whales; Low-frequency-active (LFA) sonar; Vocal behavior","Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic wave transmission; Marine biology; Regression analysis; Sonar; Underwater acoustics; Acoustic detection; Blue whale; Oceanography",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-96-1-0981","Manuscript received February 29, 2004; revised July 21, 2004; accepted October 23, 2004.

The primary goal of the study was to examine blue whale seasonally and song type as part of a larger worldwide study. Calls were recorded from blue whales of two song types, fin whales, humpback whales, Bryde's whales, and of two unknown call types, each probably produced by Bryde's whales. The peak of calling density was May through September for the blue, fin, and humpback whales. The known Bryde's whale calls occurred year-round and the probable Bryde's whale calls occurred from May through December. Blue whale songs of a type so far known only from New Zealand waters were detected within 2 km of shore and occurred four times from June to December, whereas the Southern Ocean blue whale songs were detected only further offshore in mid-winter. Bryde's whale calls were the most abundant type and often occurred near the hydrophones. These data provide a baseline from which future recordings from the same hydrophones could be compared. © 2006, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Balaenoptera; Cetacean; Hydrophone; New Zealand;

Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.","Atlantic White-sided Dolphin; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Fin Whale; Harbour Porpoise; Humpback Whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; Minke Whale; Phocoena phocoena; White-beaked Dolphin","abundance; dolphin; porpoise; prey availability; research vessel; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; whale; Canada; Halifax; North America; Nova Scotia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Edited by W.

They had been dispatched by the Norwegian whaling company Hvalfangeraktienselskapet Rosshavet, which had obtained a licence from the British government. For most of the 1923-24 season, Sir James Clark Ross occupied an uneasy anchorage in the deep waters of Discovery Inlet, a narrow embayment in the front of the Ross Ice Shelf, while her catchers pursued whales widely in the Ross Sea. During that first season they killed and processed 221 whales (211 blue whales and 10 fin whales), which yielded 17,300 barrels of oil. During the next decade, with the exception of the 1931-32 season, Sir James Clark Ross and two other factory ships operated by Rosshavet, C.A. Larsen and Sir James Clark Ross II, operated in the Ross Sea. From the 1926-27 season onwards these ships were joined by up to three other factory ships and their catchers, operated by other companies. During the decade 1923-33 the Rosshavet ships killed and processed 9122 whales in the Ross Sea sector, mainly in the open waters of the Ross Sea south of the pack-ice belt. Total harvest for all factory ships from the Ross Sea sector for the period was 18,238 whales (mainly blue whales) producing 1,490,948 barrels of oil. From 1924 onwards the Rosshavet catchers wintered in Paterson Inlet on Stewart Island, New Zealand, and from 1925 onwards a well-equipped shipyard, Kaipipi Shipyard, operated on Price Peninsula in Paterson Inlet to service the Rosshavet ships. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",,"historical geography; hunting; twentieth century; whaling; oceanic regions; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; World; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Amundsen, R., (1912) The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the 'Fram' 1910-1912, 2. , London: John Murray; Basberg, B.L., Naevestad, D., Hvalfangstminneregistrering på Syd Georgia - Vurdering av landstasjonenes tilstand og vreneverdi (1990) Norsk Polarinstitutt Meddelelser, 110; Bickel, L., (2000) Shackleton's Forgotten Men: The Untold Tragedy of the Endurance Epic, , New York: Thunder's Mouth Press and Balliett & Fitzgerald; Byrd, R.E., (1930) Little America: Aerial Exploration in the Antarctic: The Flight to the South Pole, , New York: Putnam's Sons; Cumpston, J.S., (1968) Macquarie Island, , Melbourne: Antarctic Division, Department of External Affairs; Dawbin, W.H., Whales and whaling in the Southern Ocean (1952) The Antarctic Today, pp. 151-194. , Simpson, FA.

We examined the role that seasonally high primary production supported by coastal upwelling combined with topographic breaks off California play in creating, collecting, and maintaining euphausiids at densities sufficient to allow exploitation by whales. We used concurrent ship- and mooring-based oceanographic, hydroacoustic, and net sampling, whale-sighting records, visual surveys, and time-depth recorder deployment to examine temporal and spatial linkages between (1) intensity of upwelling, (2) primary production, (3) development, density and distribution of euphausiids, and (4) the distribution, abundance, and foraging behavior of blue whales in Monterey Bay, California between 1992 and 1996. Blue whales fed exclusively upon adult euphausiids Thysanoessa spinifera and Euphausia pacifica that were larger than those generally available in the Bay. Foraging whales dove repeatedly to dense euphausiid aggregations between 150 and 200 m on the edge of the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. Euphausiid aggregations where whales were foraging averaged 153 g m-3, approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than mean euphausiid densities in the Bay (1.3 g m-3). High euphausiid densities are supported by high primary production between April and August (249 mgC m-3 d-1) and a submarine canyon that provides deep water down-current from an upwelling region. Peak euphausiid densities occur in late summer/early fall, lagging the seasonal increase in primary production by 3 to 4 mo. This lag results from the temporal development of euphausiids spawned around the spring increase in primary production and the shoreward collapse of productivity due to decreased upwelling in late summer. The migratory movements of the California blue whale probably reflect seasonal patterns in productivity in other foraging areas similar to those we describe for Monterey Bay. © Inter-Research 2005.","Blue whale; Foraging ecology; Pelagic; Predation; Upwelling","food web; foraging behavior; predator-prey interaction; primary production; secondary production; upwelling; whale; zooplankton; California; Monterey Bay; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Euphausia pacifica; Euphausiidae; Musculus; Thysanoessa spinifera",,,,,,,"Abbot, M.R., Barksdale, B., Phytoplankton pigment patterns and wind forcing off central California (1991) J Geophys Res, 96, pp. 14649-14667; Abbot, M.R., Zion, P.M., Satellite observations of phytoplankton variability during an upwelling event (1985) Cont Shelf Res, 4, pp. 661-680; Alvarino, A., Siphonophores of the Pacific with a review of the world distribution (1971) Bull Scripps Inst Oceanogr Univ Calif Tech Ser, 16, p. 432; Bakun, A., Global climate change and intensification of coastal ocean upwelling (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Bakun, A., Nelson, C.S., The seasonal cycle of wind stress curl in subtropical eastern boundary current regions (1991) J Phys Oceanogr, 21, pp. 1815-1834; Bakun, A., McLain, D.R., Mayo, P.V., The mean annual cycle of coastal upwelling western North America as observed from surface measurements (1974) Fish Bull US Dep Comm, 72, pp. 843-844; Barber, R.T., Smith, R.L., Coastal upwelling ecosystems (1981) Analysis of Marine Ecosystems, pp. 31-68. , Longhurst A (ed).

The impact on the hearing of marine mammals depends on the technical parameters of the instruments and on the exposure of the animal to noise pulses, as well as on the properties of the biological system, that is to say, on the anatomy and the audiogram of the animal. Here, the blue whale, the sperm whale and the beaked whale are taken as examples in an investigation of the potential exposure to noise pulses from the hydroacoustic instruments Hydrosweep and Parasound. Diving depths of the whales and relative speeds of the animals with respect to the survey vessels are taken into account, as well as the area impacted by the equipment, in estimating the level of sound needed to produce ""temporary threshold shift"" in an animal.

Although several phylogenetic hypotheses about these taxa have been proposed, their phylogenetic relationships still remain confusing. SINE (short interspersed repetitive element) insertion data are now regarded as almost ideal shared derived characters at the molecular level, and we have applied this method to this problem. Here, we successfully reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of these whales by characterizing 40 informative SINE loci. One of the intriguing conclusions is that balaenopterids and eschrichtiids radiated very rapidly during a very short evolutionary period. During this period, when newly inserted SINE loci retained ancestral polymorphisms, speciation occurred and these SINEs were sorted incompletely into each lineage, thus resulting in inconsistencies regarding the presence or absence of the SINE. This is in sharp contrast to the phylogeny of toothed whales, for which no SINE inconsistencies have been found. Furthermore, we found monophyletic groupings between humpback and fin whales, and also between (sei + Bryde's) and blue whales, both of which have not previously been recognized. The comprehensive SINE insertion data, together with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny that was recently completed, provide a nearly complete picture of the evolutionary history of baleen whales.","Ancestral polymorphisms; Baleen whale; Phylogenetic tree; Radiation; SINE method","cetacean; evolution; phylogenetics; whale; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Eschrichtiidae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Adachi, J., Hasegawa, M., Phylogeny of whales: Dependence of the inference on species sampling (1995) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 12, pp. 177-179; Amason, U., Gretarsdottir, S., Widegren, B., Mysticete (baleen whale) relationships based upon the sequence of the common cetacean DNA satellite (1992) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 9, pp. 1018-1028; Adegoke, J.A., Amason, U., Widegren, B., Sequence organization and evolution, in all extant whalebone whales, of a DNA satellite with terminal chromosome localization (1993) Chromosoma, 102, pp. 382-388; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species (1993) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 10, pp. 960-970; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationship of baleen whales established by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Amason, U., Gullberg, A., Cytochrome b nucleotide sequences and the identification of five primary lineages of extant cetaceans (1996) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 13, pp. 407-417; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and world-wide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proceeding of National Academy of Science, 90, pp. 8239-8243. , (14 co-authors), USA; Barnes, L.G., McLeod, S.A., The fossil record and phyletic relationships of gray whales (1984) The Gray Whale, Eschrichtius Robustus, pp. 3-32. , M.

Admin., E/GC 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305, United States","Blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, in northeast Pacific waters often produce a two-part call. The first part, A, is amplitude-modulated, lasting about 17 s, and the second part, B, is frequency-modulated, lasting about 19 s. Type B calls are more easily detected in recordings and are often the signal tracked in long-term monitoring. Automatic detection methods applied to data from a hydrophone moored at 8°N, 95°W in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) from 15 May 1996 to 15 May 1997 showed seasonal variability in call detection. Calls were detected most often from February to June. Blue whales are believed to use the ETP region as a wintering ground but probably also feed there. Blue whales forage primarily on krill that undertake diel vertical migrations from several hundred metres depth during the day to near the surface at night. We tested the null hypothesis that blue whale calling behaviour does not show significant diel variation in order to determine whether variability in calling could provide an indication as to the behavioural function of B calls. The hourly rate of B calls showed a strong diel pattern. There were significantly more calls during dark and twilight periods than during light periods (P < 0.001). These diel patterns in call production correlate well with previously established diel patterns in prey distribution, with the highest calling rates occurring when prey have been reported to be closest to the surface. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Although interannual variability of blue whale occurrence on the Antarctic feeding grounds was documented by whalers, little was known about where the whales spent the winter months. Antarctic blue whales produce calls that are distinct from those produced by blue whales elsewhere in the world. To investigate potential winter migratory destinations of Antarctic blue whales, we examined acoustic data for these signals from two low-latitude locales: the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Antarctic-type blue whale calls were detected on hydrophones in both regions during the austral autumn and winter (May-September), with peak detections in July. Calls occurred over relatively brief periods in both oceans, suggesting that there may be only a few animals migrating so far north and/or producing calls. Antarctic blue whales appear to use both the Indian and eastern Pacific Oceans concurrently, indicating that there is not a single migratory destination. Acoustic data from the South Atlantic and from mid-latitudes in the Indian or Pacific Oceans are needed for a more global understanding of migratory patterns and destinations of Antarctic blue whales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Automatic detection and acoustic power analysis methods were used for determining presence and absence of whale calls. Blue whale calls were detected year round, on average 177 days per year, with peak calling in March and April, and a secondary peak in October and November. Lowest calling rates occurred between June and September, and in December. Fin whale calling rates were seasonal with calls detected between February and June (on average 51 days/year), and peak calling in May. Sea ice formed a month later and retreated a month earlier in 2001 than in 2002 over all recording sites. During the entire deployment period, detected calls of both species of whales showed negative correlation with sea ice concentrations at all sites, suggesting an absence of blue and fin whales in areas covered with sea ice. A conservative density estimate of calling whales from the acoustic data yields 0.43 calling blue whales per 1000 n mi 2 and 1.30 calling fin whales per 1000 n mi 2, which is about one-third higher than the density of blue whales and approximately equal to the density of fin whales estimated from the visual surveys. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Swimming speeds and Reynolds number (Re) are strongly correlated with body mass, both at typical cruising speeds and at escape speeds associated with predator-prey interactions. We find that animals operating at Re &gt; 1000 typically form schools that are concentrated by many orders of magnitude above their average abundance. We calculate the rate of kinetic energy production by 11 representative species of schooling animals ranging in size from euphausiids to whales, and find it to be of the order of 10-5 W kg-1, regardless of animal size. Animal-induced turbulence is comparable in magnitude to rates of turbulent energy dissipation (ε) that result from major storms. The horizontal length scale (10 to 1000 m) of energy production rate by animal schools is comparable to the observed fine-scale variability in ε. We present detailed case studies of 4 species - Atlantic bluefin tuna, Norwegian herring, northern anchovy and Antarctic krill - all of which have schooling behavior that places them within the zone of maximum seasonal stratification where their energy production rate would be 3 to 4 orders of magnitude greater than the background average rate of turbulent energy dissipation. We conclude that schooling animals are an important source of fine-scale turbulent mixing in the ocean, especially in coastal regions during summer.","Animal swimming; Epsilon; Turbulence","biological oceanography; hydrodynamics; swimming; turbulence; Anchoa; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Decapoda (Crustacea); Engraulis mordax; Euphausiacea; Scombridae gen. sp.; Thunnus thynnus",,,,,,,"Anis, A., Moum, J., Surface wave-turbulence interactions: Scaling ε(z) near the sea surface (1995) J Phys Oceanogr, 25, pp. 2025-2045; Au, D., Pitman, R., Seabird interactions with dolphins and tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific (1986) Condor, 88, pp. 304-317; Azuma, A., (1992) The Biokinetics of Flying and Swimming, , Springer-Verlag, Tokyo; Azuma, T., Iwata, M., Influences of illumination intensity on the nearest neighbour distance in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch (1994) J Fish Biol, 45, pp. 1113-1118; Post-FIBEX acoustic workshop (1986) BIOMASS Rep Ser, 40; Blackburn, M., Oceanography and ecology of tunas (1965) Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, 3, pp. 299-322; Block, B.A., Dewar, H., Blackwell, S.B., Williams, T.D., Migratory movements, depth preferences, and thermal biology of Atlantic bluefin tuna (2001) Science, 293, pp. 1310-1314; Brainerd, K., Gregg, M., Surface mixed and mixing layer depths (1995) Deep-Sea Res 1, 42, pp. 1521-5143; Breder, C.J., Halpern, F., Innate and acquired behavior affecting the aggregation of fishes (1946) Physiol Zool, 19, pp. 154-190; Brill, R., Lutcavage, M., Metzger, G., Bushnell, P., Arendt, M., Lucy, J., Watson, C., Foley, D., Horizontal and vertical movements of juvenile bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), in relation to oceanographic conditions of the western North Atlantic, determined with ultrasonic telemetry (2002) Fish Bull, 100, pp. 155-167; Burgess, J., Shaw, E., Development and ecology of fish schooling (1979) Oceanus, 27, pp. 11-17; Buskey, E., Role of vision in the aggregative behavior of the planktonic mysid Mysidium columbiae (2000) Mar Biol, 137, pp. 257-265; Buskey, E., Peterson, J., Ambler, J., The swarming behavior of the copepod Diothona oculata: In situ and laboratory studies (1996) Limnol Oceanogr, 41, pp. 513-521; Caparroy, P., Perez, M., Carlotti, F., Feeding behavior of Centropages typicus in calm and turbulent conditions (1998) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 168, pp. 109-118; Cheng, J.Y., Chahine, G., Computational hydrodynamics of animal swimming: Boundary element method and three-dimensional vortex wake structure (2001) Comp Biochem Physiol A, 131, pp. 51-60; Costello, J.H., Strickler, J.R., Marassé, C., Trager, G.Z., Freise, A.J., Grazing in a turbulent environment: Behavioral response of a calanoid copepod, Centropages hamatus (1990) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 87, pp. 1648-1652; Csirke, J., Recruitment in the Peruvian anchovy and its dependence on the adult population (1980) Rapp P-V Réun Cons Int Explor Mer, 177, pp. 307-313; Culik, B., Wilson, R., Bannasch, R., Underwater swimming at low energetic cost by pygoscelid penguins (1994) J Exp Biol, 197, pp. 65-78; Dahlheim, M., Leatherwood, J., Perrin, W., Distribution of killer whales in the warm temperate and tropical eastern Pacific (1982) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 32, pp. 647-653; Dall, W., Hill, B.J., Rothlisberg, P.C., Sharples, D.J., The biology of the Penaeidae (1990) Adv Mar Biol, 27, pp. 1-489; Demer, D., Hewitt, R., Bias in acoustic biomass estimates of Euphausia superba due to diel vertical migration (1995) Deep-Sea Res I, 42, pp. 455-475; Dore, J.E., Tien, G., Letelier, R., Parrish, G., Szyper, J., Burgett, J., Karl, D.M., RACER: Distributions of nitrogenous nutrients near receding pack ice in Marguerite Bay (1992) Antarct J US, 27, pp. 177-179; Dower, J., Miller, T., Leggett, W., The role of microscale turbulence in the feeding ecology of larval fish (1997) Adv Mar Biol, 31, pp. 169-220; Everson, I., Watkins, J., Bone, D., Foote, K., Implications of a new acoustic target strength for abundance estimates of Antarctic krill (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 338-340; (1997) FAO Yearbook, Fishery Statistics, Catches and Landings, 46. , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome; Fish, F., Comparative kinematics and hydrodynamics of odontocete cetaceans: Morphological and ecological, correlates with swimming performance (1998) J Exp Biol, 201, pp. 2867-2877; Fish, F.E., Power output and propulsive efiiciency of swimming bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) (1993) J Exp Biol, 185, pp. 179-193; Fish, F.E., Fegeley, J.F., Xanthopolous, C.J., Burst-and-coast swimming in schooling fish (Notemisgonus crysoleucas) with implications for fish energy economy (1991) Comp Biochem Physiol A, 100, pp. 633-639; Foster, T., Middleton, J., The oceanographic structure of the eastern Scotia Sea - I.

We report the recent discovery of, arguably, the most important blue whale feeding and nursing ground known to date in the Southern Hemisphere, which is located near the fjords off southern Chile. Through aerial and marine surveys (n = 7) 47 groups, comprising 153 blue whales including at least 11 mother-calf pairs, were sighted during the austral summer and early autumn of 2003. The implications of this discovery on the biological understanding and conservation of this endangered species are discussed.","Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Conservation; Endangered species; Marine protected area; Whaling","feeding ground; nursery ground; species conservation; whale; animal care; animal food; article; breeding; Chile; controlled study; marine environment; migration; nonhuman; priority journal; whale; Chile; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast); South America; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Musculus",,,,,,,"Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell Jr., R., Baleen whales: Conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mamm.

Using acoustic and satellite remote sensing, we have continuously monitored the acoustic activity and habitat of blue whales during 1994-2000. Calling blue whales primarily aggregate off the coast of southern and central California in the late summer, coinciding with the timing of the peak euphausiid biomass, their preferred prey. The northward bloom of primary production along the coast and subsequent northbound movements of the blue whales are apparent in the satellite and acoustic records, respectively, with the calling blue whales moving north along the Oregon and Washington coasts to a secondary foraging area with high primary productivity off Vancouver Island in the late fall. El Niño conditions, indicated by elevated sea-surface temperature and depressed regional chlorophyll-a concentrations, are apparent in the satellite records, particularly in the Southern California Bight during 1997/1998. These conditions disrupt biological production and alter the presence of calling blue whales in primary feeding locations. Remote sensing using acoustics is well suited to characterizing the seasonal movements and relative abundance of the northeast Pacific blue whales, and remote sensing using satellites allows for monitoring their habitat. These technologies are invaluable because of their ability to provide continuous large-scale spatial and temporal coverage of the blue whale migration. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Two years of data were reviewed for whale vocalizations by visually examining spectrograms. Four distinct sounds were detected that are believed to be of biological origin: (1) a two-part low-frequency moan at roughly 18 Hz lasting 25 s which has previously been attributed to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus); (2) series of short pulses approximately 18 s apart centered at 22 Hz, which are likely produced by fin whales (B. physalus); (3) series of short, pulsive sounds at 30 Hz and above and approximately 1 s apart that resemble sounds attributed to minke whales (B. acutorostrata); and (4) downswept, pulsive sounds above 30 Hz that are likely from baleen whales. Vocalizations were detected most often in the winter, and blue- and fin whale sounds were detected most often on the northern hydrophones. Sounds from seismic airguns were recorded frequently, particularly during summer, from locations over 3000 km from this array. Whales were detected by these hydrophones despite its location in a very remote part of the Atlantic Ocean that has traditionally been difficult to survey. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Biodiversity; Data reduction; Hydrophones; Marine biology; Seismic airgun sounds; Spectrograms; Whale vocalizations; Sound recording; acoustics; acoustics; article; Atlantic Ocean; frequency analysis; modulation; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; sound detection; sound transmission; vocalization; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Firearms; Natural Disasters; Noise; Noise, Transportation; Seasons; Ships; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,"Bento, R., (2002) ""Monitorização Acústica da Sazonalidade de Misticetos na Crista Média Atlântica"" (Acoustic Monitoring of Mysticete Sounds Along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), , Masters thesis, Universidade dos Açores, Ponta Delgada; Cerchio, S., Dahlheim, M., Variation in feeding vocalizations of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae from southeast Alaska (2001) Bioacoustics, 11, pp. 277-295; Charif, R.A., Clark, C.W., Acoustic monitoring of large whales off north and west Britain and Ireland: A two-year study, October 1996-September 1998 (2000) Joint Nature Conservation Committee Technical Report 313; Charif, R.A., Clapham, P.J., Clark, C.W., Acoustic detections of singing humpback whales in deep waters off the British Isles (2001) Marine Mammal Sci., 17, pp. 751-768; Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Humpback whale songs as indicators of migration routes (1990) Marine Mammal Sci., 6, pp. 155-160; Clapham, P., Mead, J.G., Megaptera novaeangliae (1999) Mammalian Species, 604, pp. 1-9; Clark, C.W., Application of U.S. Navy underwater hydrophone arrays for scientific research on whales (1994) Rep.

This network is designed to capture ecologically significant habitat for marine species of common conservation concern and pelagic regions of high productivity, with due consideration for the inter-annual sea surface temperature fluctuations of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we present analytical methods that define pelagic habitat based upon the density of steep temperature gradients, or fronts, and we quantify their spatial and temporal persistence over a single ENSO cycle (1996-1999) to benefit marine conservation and marine management strategies. We find that less than 1% of the Northeast Pacific ocean exhibits a persistent (&gt; 8 mo/yr) concentration of temperature fronts (&gt;.2km/km 2) within and between years. The Baja California Frontal System (BCFS) is the largest concentration found within the multinational federal waters, between 0 and 300 km east of Baja California Sur. The BCFS appears more active under La Niña conditions, while the next largest persistent concentration, North Pacific Transition Zone, appears more active under El Niño conditions. We demonstrate habitat functions associated with the BCFS for blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax).

Estimated whaling mortality was unsustainable from 1928 to 1972 (except during 1942-1944), depleting them from 239,000 (95% interval 202,000-311,000) to a low of 360 (150-840) in 1973. Obtaining statistical evidence for subsequent increases has proved difficult due to their scarcity. We fitted Bayesian models to three sighting series (1968-2001), constraining maximum rates of increase to 12% per annum. These models indicated that Antarctic blue whales are increasing at a mean rate of 7.3% per annum (1.4%-11.6%). Informative priors based on blue whale biology (4.3%, SD = 1.9%) and a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis of increase rates in other blue whale populations (-0.3%, SD = 11.6%), suggest plausible increase rates are lower (although the latter has wide intervals), but a meta-analysis of other mysticetes obtains similar rates of increase (6.7%, SD = 4.0%). Possible biases affecting the input abundance estimates are discussed. Although Antarctic blue whales appear to have been increasing since Soviet illegal whaling ended in 1972, they still need to be protected - their estimated 1996 population size, 1,700 (860-2,900), was just 0.7% (03%-1.3%) of the pre-exploitation level.","Abundance estimate; Antarctic blue whales; Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Bayesian models; Meta-analysis; Population assessment; Rate of increase; Southern Hemisphere; True blue whales","Bayesian analysis; population estimation; population growth; population modeling; whale; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Balaenoptera musculus intermedia; Cetacea; Mammalia; Musculus",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Continued increase in humpback whales off Western Australia (1994) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 44, pp. 309-310; Bannister, J., Status of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) off Australia (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 103-110; Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth-interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback: Whales (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 535-546; Best, P.B., Increase rates in severely depleted stocks of baleen whales (1993) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 50, pp. 169-186; Best, P.B., Brandão, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, (2 SPEC.

Although humpbacks have been studied intensively in nearshore or coastal feeding and breeding areas, their migratory movements between these areas have been largely inferred. Blue whales have only been studied intensively along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and their seasonal occurrence and movements elsewhere in the North Atlantic are poorly known. We investigated the historical seasonal distributions of these two species using sighting and catch data extracted from American 18th and 19th century whaling logbooks. These data suggest that humpback whales migrated seasonally from low-latitude calving/ breeding grounds over a protracted period, and that some of them traveled far offshore rather than following coastal routes. Also, at least some humpbacks apparently fed early in the summer west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, well south of their known present-day feeding grounds. In assessing the present status of the North Atlantic humpback population, it will be important to determine whether such offshore feeding does in fact occur. Blue whales were present across the southern half of the North Atlantic during the autumn and winter months, and farther north in spring and summer, but we had too few data points to support inferences about these whales' migratory timing and routes.","Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Migration; North Atlantic","feeding ground; migration; population distribution; seasonality; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Musculus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Taylor, S., Sutherland, H., Logbook records of 19th century American sperm whaling: A report on the 12 month project, 1978-79 (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 821-833; Charif, R.A., Clapham, P.J., Clark, C.W., Acoustic detections of singing humpback whales in deep waters off the British Isles (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 751-768; Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Palsbøll, P.J., High latitude area composition of humpback whale competitive groups in Samana Bay - Further evidence for panmixis in the North Atlantic population (1993) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 71, pp. 1065-1066; Clark, C.W., Blue deep voices: Insights from the Navy's Whales '93 program (1994) Whalewatcher, 28 (1), pp. 6-11; Dickinson, A., Sanger, C., Modern shore-based whaling in Newfoundland and Labrador: Expansion and consolidation, 1898-1902 (1990) International Journal of Maritime History, 2, pp. 83-116; Ingebrigtsen, A., Whales caught in the North Atlantic and other seas (1929) Rapports et Procès-verbaux des Réunions, Conseil Permanent International Pour L'Exploration de la Mer, 56, pp. 1-26; Report of the Sub-committee on the Comprehensive Assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Supplement), 4, pp. 230-1200; Jann, B., Allen, J., Carrillo, M., Hanquet, S., Katona, S.K., Martin, A.R., Reeves, R.R., Wenzel, F.W., Migration of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) between the Cape Verde Islands and Iceland (2003) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 5, pp. 125-129; Jonsgård, Å., The distribution of Balaenopteridae in the North Atlantic Ocean (1966) Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises, pp. 114-124. , K.

Mathematics, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7701, South Africa","As a first step in investigating the major predator-prey interactions in the Antarctic, a model describing blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, minke whales Balaenoptera acutomstrata and krill Euphausia superba is developed. Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20th century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration.","Antarctic; Blue whale; Krill; Minke whale; Multispecies model; Predator-prey interaction","ecological modeling; food availability; interspecific competition; population dynamics; predator-prey interaction; Antarctica; Arctic and Antarctic; World; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausia; Euphausia superba; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Musculus; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Armstrong, R.S., McGehee, R.A., Competitive exclusion (1980) Am.

Box 271, San Diego, CA 92038, United States","We estimated humpback and blue whale abundance from 1991 to 1997 off the west coast of the U.S. and Mexico comparing capture-recapture models based on photographically identified animals and line-transect methods from ship-based surveys. During photo-identification research we obtained 4,212 identifications of 824 humpback whales and 2,403 identifications of 908 blue whales primarily through non-systematic small-boat surveys along the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. Line-transect surveys from NOAA ships in 1991, 1993, and 1996 covered approximately 39,000 km along the coast of Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington out to 555 km from shore. The nearshore and clumped distribution of humpback whales allowed photographic identification from small boats to cost-effectively sample a substantial portion of the population, but made it difficult to obtain effective samples in the line-transect surveys covering broad areas. The humpback capture-recapture estimates indicated humpback whale abundance increased over the six years (from 569 to 837). The broader more offshore distribution of blue whales made it harder to obtain a representative sample of identification photographs, but was well suited to the line-transect estimates. The line-transect estimates, after correction for missed animals, indicated approximately 3,000 blue whales (CV = 0.14). Capture-recapture estimates of blue whales were lower than this: approximately 2,000 when using photographs obtained from the line-transect surveys as one of the samples. Comparison of the results from the two methods provides validation, as well as insight into potential biases associated with each method.","Abundance; Assessment methods; Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Capture recapture; Eastern North Pacific; Humpback whale; Line transect; Megaptera novaeangliae","abundance; identification method; line transect; mark-recapture method; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Musculus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertson, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature (London), 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.B., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urbán-R, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales, world-wide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Barlow, J., Abundance of large whales in California coastal waters: A comparison of ship surveys in 1979/80 and in 1991 (1994) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 44, pp. 399-406; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

In blue whales, concentrations of 25 PCB congeners, DDT and metabolites and several other organochlorine compounds were present at higher concentrations in the blubber of males relative to females; reflecting maternal transfer of these persistent contaminants from females into young. Sex-related differences in concentrations were not observed with less persistent contaminants, such as HCHs. In humpback whale samples, there were no significant differences in the concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine compounds in the blubber of females and calves. These data indicate that calves quickly bioaccumulate contaminants by transplacental and lactational routes to concentrations that are in equilibrium with females. In comparisons between contaminant concentrations and patterns in the blubber of female blue and humpback whales, there were no significant differences in concentrations, but the proportions of some PCB congeners, HCH isomers, and DDT and its metabolites were different in the two baleen whale species. These may reflect differences in the diet of the two species, since fish comprise a large part of the diet of humpback whales and blue whales feed exclusively on euphausiid crustaceans (i.e. krill). © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The most common signals were long, patterned sequences of very-low-frequency sounds in the 15-20 Hz band. Sounds within a sequence were hierarchically organized into phrases consisting of one or two different sound types. Sequences were typically composed of two-part phrases repeated every 73 s: a constant-frequency tonal ""A"" part lasting approximately 8 s, followed 5 s later by a frequency-modulated ""B"" part lasting approximately 11 s. A common sequence variant consisted only of repetitions of part A. Sequences were separated by silent periods averaging just over four minutes. Two other sound types are described: a 2-5 s tone at 9 Hz, and a 5-7s inflected tone that swept up in frequency to ca. 70 Hz and then rapidly down to 25 Hz. The general characteristics of repeated sequences of simple combinations of long-duration, very-low-frequency sound units repeated every 1-2 min are typical of blue whale sounds recorded in other parts of the world. However, the specific frequency, duration, and repetition interval features of these North Atlantic sounds are different than those reported from other regions, lending further support to the notion that geographically separate blue whale populations have distinctive acoustic displays. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic waves; Frequency modulation; Blue whale; Acoustics; acoustic array; bioacoustics; communication; frequency analysis; population dynamics; whale; acoustics; animal behavior; article; Atlantic Ocean; Balaenoptera musculus; frequency modulation; nonhuman; priority journal; sound intensity; vocalization; whale; Animals; Oceans and Seas; Sound; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal; Whales; Atlantic Ocean",,,,,,,"Alling, A., (2003), Personal communication; Alling, A., Dorsey, E., Gordon, J., Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) off the northeast coast of Sri Lanka: Distribution, feeding and individual identification (1991) Cetaceans and Cetacean Research in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary, pp. 247-258. , edited by S.

To determine if blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) might now occur in the Gulf of Alaska, an array of hydrophones was deployed there in October 1999. Data were retrieved in May 2000 and in June 2001. Spectrograms from a random subsample comprising 15% of the ∼63,000 h of data were visually examined for blue whale calls. Call types attributed to both northeastern and northwestern Pacific blue whales were recorded. Both of these call types were recorded seasonally from the initial deployment date in October 1999 through the third week of December 1999 and then from July 2000 through mid-December 2000. Both call types were regularly recorded on the same hydrophone at the same time indicating clear temporal and spatial overlap of the animals producing these calls. Two blue while call types were recorded in the Gulf of Alaska suggesting that perhaps two stocks use this area. The northeastern call type has now been documented from the equator up to at least 55°N in the eastern North Pacific.","Acoustics; Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Geographic variation; Gulf of Alaska","bioacoustics; spatial distribution; vocalization; whale; Gulf of Alaska; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Musculus",,,,,,,"Alling, A., Dorsey, E.M., Gordon, J.C.D., Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) off the Northeast coast of Sri Lanka: Distribution, feeding and individual identification (1991) UNEP Marine Mammal Technical Report, 3, pp. 247-258; Berzin, A.A., Rovnin, A.A., Distribution and migration of whales in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean, Bering and Chukchi seas (1966) Izvestiya TINRO, 58, pp. 179-207; Panin, K.I., (1966) Soviet Research on Marine Mammals of the Far East, pp. 103-136. , [In Russian] Translation by Bureau of Commercia.

Morphological methods for identifying prey components after consumption often fail to make accurate identifications of invertebrates because prey morphology becomes damaged during capture, ingestion and digestion. Another disadvantage of morphological methods for prey identification is that they often involve sampling procedures that are disruptive for the predator, such as stomach flushing or lethal collection. We have developed a DNA-based method for identifying species of krill (Crustacea: Malacostraca), an enormously abundant group of invertebrates that are directly consumed by many groups of marine vertebrates. The DNA-based approach allows identification of krill species present in samples of vertebrate stomach contents, vomit, and, more importantly, faeces. Utilizing samples of faeces from vertebrate predators minimizes the impact of dietary studies on the subject animals. We demonstrate our method first on samples of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) stomach contents, where DNA-based species identification can be confirmed by prey morphology. We then apply the method to faeces of Adelie penguins and to faeces of the endangered pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda). In each of these cases, krill species consumed by the predators could be identified from their DNA present in faeces or stomach contents.","Diet; Faeces; Food web; Noninvasive; PCR; Trophic","Animals; Base Sequence; Birds; DNA; DNA, Ribosomal; Euphausiacea; Feces; Feeding Behavior; Gastrointestinal Contents; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Whales; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda; Cetacea; Crustacea; Euphausiacea; Invertebrata; Malacostraca; Musculus; Pygoscelis; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae; Vertebrata",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, Ribosomal",,,,,"Abu Al-Soud, W., Rådström, P., Capacity of nine thermostable polymerases to mediate DNA amplification in the presence of PCR-inhibiting samples (1998) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 64, pp. 3748-3753; Aron, W., Burke, W., Freeman, M.M.R., The whaling issue (2000) Marine Policy, 24, pp. 179-191; Baker, A.C., Boden, B.P., Brinton, E., (1990) A Practical Guide to the Euphausiids of the World, , Natural History Museum publications, London; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Which whales are hunted?

However, the two largest predators on earth, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) and the fin whale (B. physalus), perform short dives for their size. Here, we test the hypothesis that the foraging behavior of these two species (lunge-feeding) is energetically expensive and limits their dive duration. We estimated the cost of lunge-feeding in both species using an approach that combined attaching time/depth recorders to seven blue whales and eight fin whales and comparing the collected dive information with predictions made by optimality models of dive behavior. We show that the rate at which whales recovered from a foraging dive was twice that of a non-foraging dive and that the cost of foraging relative to the cost of travel to and from the prey patch was 3.15 in blue whales (95 % CI 2.58-3.72) and 3.60 in fin whales (95% CI 2.35-4.85). Whales foraged in small areas (&lt;1 km2) and foraging bouts lasted more than one dive, indicating that prey did not disperse and thus that prey dispersal could not account for the limited dive durations of the whales. Despite the enormous size of blue whales and fin whales, the high energetic costs of lunge-feeding confine them to short durations of submergence and to areas with dense prey aggregations. As a corollary, because of their limited foraging time under water, these whales may be particularly vulnerable to perturbations in prey abundance.","Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Blue whale; Diving; Feeding costs; Fin whale; Foraging","Animal; Body Constitution; Comparative Study; Diving; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Models, Biological; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Whales; Animals; Body Constitution; Energy Metabolism; Models, Biological; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; animal; article; biological model; body constitution; comparative study; diving; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; histology; physiology; predation; species difference; whale",,,,,,,"Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine Mammals.

Although no confirmed DA toxicity events have been reported in whales, here we present data demonstrating that humpback and blue whales are exposed to the toxin and consume DA contaminated prey. Whale fecal samples were found to contain DA at levels ranging from 10 to 207μg DA g-1 feces via HPLC-UV methods. SEM analysis of whale feces containing DA, collected from krill-feeding whales, revealed the presence of diatom frustules identified as Pseudo-nitzschia australis, a known DA producer. Humpback whales were observed feeding on anchovies and sardines that contained DA at levels ranging from 75 to 444μg DA g-1 viscera. DA contamination of whale feces and fish occurred only during blooms of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia. Additionally, several novel fish species collected during a toxic diatom bloom were tested for DA. Fish as diverse as benthic sanddabs and pelagic albacore were found to contain the neurotoxin, suggesting that DA permeates benthic as well as pelagic communities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

High densities of minke whales and large aggregations of euphausiids were observed along the ice edge over the continental slope in the southeast region of area IV and in the southwest region of area V. The results suggest that the continental slope zone that coincides with the ice edge would be an important minke whale feeding area. Minke whales were rarely sighted in the offshore region even if euphausiids were abundant. Distributions of humpback whales were correlated with high euphausiid density zones, regardless of the bottom topographic features. Several groups of blue whales were sighted in the small area along the ice edge where euphausiids were abundant, but sightings were too few to draw any general conclusion about the relationship between blue whales and euphausiids. Both baleen whales and euphausiids were scarce in the area east of 170°W where sea ice covered the continental shelf and slope zone.",,"acoustic survey; predator-prey interaction; spatial distribution; whale; zooplankton; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Mysticeti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"(1986) Post-FIBEX Acoustic Workshop.

Mysticete whales, including six endangered species, may be at risk from this noise pollution because all species produce and probably perceive low-fre-quency sound. We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of loud, LF noise on foraging fin blue (B. musculus) and (Balaenoptera physalus) whales off San Nicolas Island, California. Naive observers used a combination of attached tracking devices, ship-based surveys, aerial surveys, photo-identification and passive monitoring of vocal behaviour to examine the behaviour and distribution of whales when a loud LF source (US Navy SURTASS LFA) was and was not transmitting. During transmission, 12-30% of the estimated received levels of LFA of whales in the study area exceeded 140 dB re 1 μPa. However, whales continued to be seen foraging in the region. Overall, whale encounter rates and diving behaviour appeared to be more strongly linked to changes in prey abundance associated with oceanographic parameters than to LF sound transmissions. In some cases, whale vocal behaviour was significantly different between experimental and non-experimental periods. However, these differences were not consistent and did not appear to be related to LF sound transmissions. At the spatial and temporal scales examined, we found no obvious responses of whales to a loud, anthropogenic, LF sound. We suggest that the cumulative effects of anthropogenic LF noise over larger temporal and spatial scales than examined here may be a more important consideration for management agencies.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Musculus",,,,,,,"Bakun, A., Nelson, C.S., The seasonal cycle of wind stress curl in subtropical eastern boundary current regions (1991) J.

We used this positional information and oceanographic data (bathymetry, temperature, and salinity) to predict critical habitat off the coast of British Columbia for sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales. We used generalized linear models at annual and monthly time scales to relate whale occurrence to six predictor variables (month, depth, slope, depth class, and sea surface temperature and salinity). The models showed critical habitat for sei, fin, and male sperm whales along the continental slope and over a large area off the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Habitat models for blue, humpback, and female sperm whales were relatively insensitive to the predictor variables, owing partially to the smaller sample sizes for these groups. The habitat predictions lend support to recent hypotheses about sperm whale breeding off British Columbia and identify humpback whale habitat in sheltered bays and straits throughout the coast. The habitat models also provide insights about the nature of the linkages between the environment and the distribution of whales in the North Pacific Ocean.",,"ecological modeling; habitat use; prediction; whale; whaling; British Columbia; Canada; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus",,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Social organization in sperm whales (1979), pp. 227-289. , Behavior of marine animals.

However, body mass index was introduced as a measure of body fat, which might not be expected to have such wide implications for various pathological conditions. We argue here that body mass index may actually be a measure for longevity. Our arguments are based on a well-established allometric scaling law for physiological time. The time between heart beats, the time between respirations, and longevity all scale as body weight to the 1/4 power in mammalian species ranging from shrews to blue whales. We find that body mass index also scales with body weight to the 1/4 power in humans from birth to one year of age, and again from approximately 5 to 17 years of age.

No animals have been found to dive for durations that are consistently shorter than their TADL. We attached time-depth recorders to 7 blue whales and 15 fin whales (family Balaenopteridae). The diving behavior of both species was similar, and we distinguished between foraging and traveling dives. Foraging dives in both species were deeper, longer in duration and distinguished by a series of vertical excursions where lunge feeding presumably occurred. Foraging blue whales lunged 2.4 ( ± 1.13) times per dive, with a maximum of six times and average vertical excursion of 30.2 ( ± 10.04) m. Foraging fin whales lunged 1.7 ( ± 0.88) times per dive, with a maximum of eight times and average vertical excursion of 21.2 ( ± 4.35) m. The maximum rate of ascent of lunges was higher than the maximum rate of descent in both species, indicating that feeding lunges occurred on ascent. Foraging dives were deeper and longer than non-feeding dives in both species. On average, blue whales dived to 140.0 ( ± 46.01) m and 7.8 ( ± 1.89) min when foraging, and 67.6 ( ± 51.46) m and 4.9 ( ± 2.53) min when not foraging. Fin whales dived to 97.9 ( ± 32.59) m and 6.3 ( ± 1.53) min when foraging and to 59.3 ( ± 29.67) m and 4.2 ( ± 1.67) min when not foraging. The longest dives recorded for both species, 14.7 min for blue whales and 16.9 min for fin whales, were considerably shorter than the TADL of 31.2 and 28.6 min, respectively. An allometric comparison of seven families diving to an average depth of 80-150 m showed a significant relationship between body mass and dive duration once Balaenopteridae whales, with a mean dive duration of 6.8 min, were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the short dive durations of blue whales and fin whales cannot be explained by the shallow distribution of their prey. We propose instead that short duration diving in large whales results from either: (1) dispersal behavior of prey; or (2) a high energetic cost of foraging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Aerobic dive limit; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Blue whale; Diving; Fin whale; Foraging; Rorquals","allometry; animal behavior; body mass; conference paper; controlled study; depth perception; diving; energy cost; locomotion; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; species difference; time; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Musculus",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: 50ABNF500153, 40ABNC602168, 40ABNF600916

We identified requisite comigration of mother and offspring during gravidity and lactation as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In addition, our model predicts that the common assumption that geographical patterns of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could be translated into female migration rates (Nm(f)) will cause biased estimates of maternal gene flow when extensive male migration occurs and male mtDNA haplotypes are included in the analysis.","Elephants, female/offspring comigration; Population genetics; Sex-specific migration; Simulations; Whales","Asia; blue whale; elephant; gender; gene flow; mammal; migration; mitochondrial DNA; model; population structure; specificity; Animals; Body Constitution; Computer Simulation; Elephants; Female; Male; Mammals; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Theoretical; Movement; Population; Sex Characteristics; Stochastic Processes; Whales; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; elephant; Elephantidae; Elephas maximus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Tiedemann, R.; Unit of Evolutionary Genetics, Inst. of Molec.

Genetic analysis of the development of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila has unearthed a fruitful number of genes involved in establishing the basic body plan, patterning of limbs, specification of cell fate and regulation of programmed cell death. The genes involved in these developmental processes have been conserved throughout evolution and homologous genes are involved in the patterning of insect and human limbs. Despite these important discoveries, we have learned astonishingly little about one of the most obvious distinctions between animals: their difference in body size. The mass of the smallest mammal, the bumble-bee bat, is 2g while that of the largest mammal, the blue whale, is 150 t or 150 million grams. Remarkably, even though they are in the same class, body size can vary up to 75-million-fold. Furthermore, this body growth can be finite in the case of most vertebrates or it can occur continuously throughout life, as for trees, molluscs and large crustaceans. Currently, we know comparatively little about the genetic control of body size. In this article we will review recent evidence from vertebrates and particularly from Drosophila that implicates insulin/insulin like growth factor-I and other growth pathways in the control of cell, organ and body size.","Chico/IRS; Drosophila; Growth; Insulin/IGF-I; Nutritional sensor; PTEN","Animalia; Apoidea; Balaenoptera musculus; Bombus pennsylvanicus; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cetacea; Crustacea; Drosophila; Hexapoda; Insecta; Mammalia; Mollusca; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Araki, E., Lipes, M.A., Patti, M.E., Brüning, J.C., Haag, B.I., Johnson, R.S., Kahn, C.R., Alternative pathway of insulin signalling in mice with targeted disruption of the IRS-1 gene (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 186-190; Avruch, J., Insulin signal transduction through protein kinase cascades (1998) Mol.

Tags summarized dive-duration data into eight 3-h periods daily. One tag additionally summarized dive depth and time-at-depth information for these same periods. Tracking periods ranged from 0.6 to 12.7 d and provided data for 17 three-hour summary periods, representing 2,007 dives (788 of which provided depth information). Total number of dives during a 3-h summary period ranged from 83 to 128. Seventy-two percent of dives were ≤ I min long. All whales spent >94% of their time submerged. Average duration of true dives (dives >1 min) ranged from 4.2 to 7.2 min. Seventy-five percent of depth-monitored dives were to ≤16 m, accounting for 78% of that animal's time. Average depth of dives to >16 m was 105 ± 13 m.","Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Dive behavior; Radio-tracking; Satellite telemetry","diving behavior; tracking; whale; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Musculus",,,,,,,"Alling, A., Dorsey, E.M., Gordon, J.C.D., Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) off the northeast coast of Sri Lanka: Distribution, feeding and individual identification (1991) United Nations Marine Mammal Technical Report, 3, pp. 247-258; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; (1982) Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid and North Atlantic Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, , Final Report of the Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program.

The catch data were analyzed using annual and monthly mean values. Monthly and annual variation in whaling effort was deduced from accounts of the history of British Columbia coastal whaling, and biases arising from changes in effort were considered in the interpretation of the results. During the later years of whaling (1948-1967), the mean lengths of captured whales declined significantly and pregnancy rates dropped to near zero in fin, sei, and blue whales. Monthly patterns in numbers killed revealed a summer migration of sei and blue whales past Vancouver Island, and confirms anecdotal suggestions that local populations of fin and humpback whales once spent extended periods in the coastal waters of British Columbia. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that sperm whales mated (April-May) and calved (July-August) in British Columbia's offshore waters. The historic whaling records reveal much about the migratory behavior and distribution of the large whales species as they once were, and may continue to be, in the northeastern Pacific. Verifying the persistence of these trends in the remnant populations is a necessary and logical next step.","Blue whale; British Columbia; Fin whale; Humpback whale; Migration; North Pacific; Population structure; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Whaling","fishery survey; long-term change; migration; population structure; whale; (Northeast); British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Best, P.B., (1979) Social Organization in Sperm Whales, pp. 227-289. , H.

A clear difference in densities against the physiographic variables (the sea floor-slope type) was identified between baleen whales and toothed whales. Densities of sperm whales and ziphiids were low in the waters over the continental shelf where minke whales' densities were highest. This led to an apparent negative correlation in the density between minke and sperm whales, and minke whale and ziphiids. A significant positive correlation in density between minke and blue whales was identified. No association in density between minke and humpback whales was observed. Distribution of killer whales shows strong positive correlation with that of minke whales. The positive correlation existed between minke and blue whales, and minke and killer whales even when the effect of environmental variables was excluded.

Seventeen species were represented: Blue Whale (1 single stranding), Fin Whale (1 single stranding), Minke Whale (3 single strandings), Humpback Whale (4 single strandings), Sperm Whale (8 strandings, 13 animals), Pygmy Sperm Whale (3 strandings, 4 animals), Dwarf Sperm Whale (2 single strandings), Northern Bottlenose Whale (3 single strandings), Sowerby's Beaked Whale (1 single stranding), Killer Whale (1 single stranding), Long-finned Pilot Whale (37 strandings, 173+ animals), White-beaked Dolphin (1 stranding, 2 animals), Atlantic White-sided Dolphin (9 strandings, 13 animals), Risso's Dolphin (1 single stranding), Striped Dolphin (8 strandings, 22 animals), Short-beaked Common Dolphin (4 strandings, 6 animals), Harbour Porpoise (11 strandings, 13 animals). The records of the Dwarf Sperm Whale and that of the Risso's Dolphin are the first for eastern Canada. The record of the Sowerby's Beaked Whale is the first reported stranding in Nova Scotia. Humpback, Minke, and Killer whales, and Short-beaked Common Dolphins have not previously been recorded stranded on Sable Island. The majority of stranding events (84) were of a single animal; nine involved two animals; eight involved 3-10 animals; and one event involved over 130 animals. Recorded strandings increased from 1.9 strandings/year between 1970-1989 to 7.1 strandings/year between 1990-1998. Mass strandings of multiple male Sperm Whales have occurred three times (all since 1990). All Atlantic White-sided Dolphin strandings investigated were also comprised of male animals.","Cetacean; Nova Scotia; Sable Island; Stranding","animal behavior; canada; Cetacea; dolphin; humpback whale; sperm whale; whale; cetacean; stranding; Canada; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Mammalia; Martes zibellina; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella coeruleoalba; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., True's beaked whale in Nova Scotia (1939) Journal of Mammalogy, 20, pp. 259-260; Ailing, A.K., Whitehead, H.P., A preliminary study of the status of White-beaked Dolphins, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and other small cetaceans off the coast of Labrador (1987) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 101, pp. 131-135; Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Status of Risso's Dolphin, Grampus griseus, in Canada (1991) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 105, pp. 233-242; Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Whitehead, H., Status of the Striped Dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, in Canada (1993) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 107, pp. 455-465; Baird, R.W., Walters, E.L., Stacey, P.J., Status of the Bottlenose Dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, with special reference to Canada (1993) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 107, pp. 466-480; Baird, R.W., Nelson, D., Lien, J., Nagorsen, D.W., The status of the Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia breviceps, in Canada (1996) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 110, pp. 525-532; Bloch, D., Desportes, G., Petersen, A., Sigurjónsson, J., Strandings of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and sightings in the Northeast Atlantic, north of 50 N latitude (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 125-132; Bossart, G.D., Walsh, M.T., Odell, D.K., Lynch, J.D., Beusse, D.O., Friday, R., Young, W.G., Histopathologic findings in a mass stranding of pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) (1991) Marine Mammal Strandings in the United States, pp. 85-90. , Proceedings of the 2nd marine mammal stranding workshop, Miami, Florida.

In this study, we have sequenced the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of an odontocete, the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and included it in phylogenetic analyses together with the previously sequenced complete mtDNAs of two mysticeres (the fin and blue whales) and a number of other mammals, including five artiodactyls (the hippopotamus, cow, sheep, alpaca, and pig). The most strongly supported cetartiodactyl relationship was: outgroup,((pig, alpaca),((cow, sheep),(hippopotamus,(sperm whale,(baleen whales))))). As in previous analyses of complete mtDNAs, the sister-group relationship between the hippopotamus and the whales received strong support, making both Artiodactyla and Suiformes (pigs, peccaries, and hippopotamuses) paraphyletic. In addition, the analyses identified a sister-group relationship between Suina (the pig) and Tylopoda (the alpaca), although this relationship was not strongly supported. The paleontological records of both mysticetes and odontocetes extend into the Oligocene, suggesting that the mysticete and odontocete lineages diverged 32-34 million years before present (MYBP). Use of this divergence date and the complete mtDNAs of the sperm whale and the two baleen whales allowed the establishment of a new molecular reference, O/M-33, for dating other eutherian divergences. There was a general consistency between O/M-33 and the two previously established eutherian references, A/C-60 and E/R-50. Cetacean (whale) origin, i.e., the divergence between the hippopotamus and the cetaceans, was dated to ≃55 MYBP, while basal artiodactyl divergences were dated to ≥ 65 MYBP. Molecular estimates of Tertiary eutherian divergences were consistent with the fossil record.","Cetacea; Cetancodonta; Cetferungulata Cetartiodactyla; Molecular references; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Sperm whale","mitochondrial DNA;
