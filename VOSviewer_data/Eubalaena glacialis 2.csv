To evaluate intrinsic and environmental factors associated with probabilities of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis migrating to a wintering ground off the southeastern United States (SEUS), we applied a multistate temporary emigration capture-recapture model to 22 years of photo-identification data. Migration probabilities for juveniles were generally higher yet more variable than those for adults, and non-calving adult females were the least likely group to migrate. The highest migration probabilities for juveniles and adult males coincided with years of relatively high calving rates, following years of higher prey availability in a fall feeding ground. Right whale migration to the SEUS can be classified as condition-dependent partial migration, which includes skipped breeding partial migration for reproductive females, and is likely influenced by tradeoffs among ecological factors such as reproductive costs and foraging opportunities that vary across individuals and time. The high variability in migration reported in this study provides insight into the ecological drivers of migration but presents challenges to right whale monitoring and conservation strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; breeding; driver; environmental factor; Eubalaena; female; foraging; human; juvenile; male; monitoring; nonhuman; probability; United States",,,,,"Save the Manatee Trust Fund, STMTF

Variability in survey effort has been the biggest limiting factor to studying changes in the population's occurrence and habitat use. Such efforts could be enhanced considerably using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We sought to determine if variation in whale presence, relative abundance, demography, and/or behavior (estimated through visual surveys) could be explained by variation in three right whale call types in this habitat. A generalized linear model was fit to 23 d of concurrent PAM and visual monitoring during four summers within the Roseway Basin Right Whale Critical Habitat boundaries. The model revealed significant positive relationships between relative abundance, call counts and presence of surface-active group behavior. PAM can refine daily right whale presence estimates. While visual observations (n = 23 d) implied a 40% decline in right whale presence during 2014–2015 relative to 2004–2005, PAM data (n = 211 d) showed right whales were present between 71%–85% of survey days throughout all years analyzed. We demonstrate that PAM is a useful tool to extend periods of right whale monitoring, especially in areas where visual monitoring efforts may be limited. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy","abundance; acoustic-visual monitoring; call counts; gunshot; moan; right whale; surface-active group; upcall","abundance; bioacoustics; calling behavior; diurnal variation; habitat use; relative abundance; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Roseway Basin; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Chicago Association of Law Libraries, CALL

In the mysticetes, large baleen whales, young calves are known to be vulnerable to direct predation from both shark and orca predators; therefore, it is possible that mother–calf pairs may show cryptic behaviours to avoid the attention of predators. Baleen whales primarily communicate through low-frequency acoustic signals, which can travel over long ranges. In this study, we explore the potential for acoustic crypsis, a form of cryptic behaviour to avoid predator detection, in North Atlantic right whale mother–calf pairs. We predicted that mother–calf pairs would either show reduced calling rates, reduced call amplitude or a combination of these behavioural modifications when compared with other demographic groups in the same habitat. Our results show that right whale mother–calf pairs have a strong shift in repertoire usage, significantly reducing the number of higher amplitude, long-distance communication signals they produced when compared with juvenile and pregnant whales in the same habitat. These observations show that right whale mother–calf pairs rely upon acoustic crypsis, potentially to minimize the risk of acoustic eavesdropping by predators. © 2019 The Authors.

More than 4800 historical Calanus spp. water column integrated samples as well as 221 vertically stratified sampling stations were used to create a 3D (latitude, longitude and vertical) climatology of Calanus spp. biomass densities for spring and summer-fall when NARW are feeding in Canadian waters. We then combined this 3D preyscape with bio-energetic considerations to highlight potentially suitable NARW foraging habitats in the region. Our 3D climatological approach successfully identified the known feeding areas of Grand Manan (BoF) and Roseway Basin (western SS), confirming its validity. Expanding our analyses to the GSL and other parts of the SS, we identified in both regions areas previously unknown where Calanus spp. biomass densities exceeded minimum levels suitable for foraging NARW. Our results represent a key contribution to the identification of important foraging areas for NARW in Canadian waters, especially in the context of climate change and the documented shift in NARW distribution. © 2019 Crown copyright 2019.","Calanus; North Atlantic Right; Northwest Atlantic; spatial distribution; vertical distribution; whale habitat","biomass; climate change; climatology; feeding; foraging behavior; spatial distribution; vertical distribution; water column; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Bay of Fundy; Roseway Basin; Scotia Shelf; Calanus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO

We quantified interannual variation in anomalies of abundance and biomass of Calanus spp. and near-surface and near-bottom ocean temperature and salinity from 19 subregions spanning the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank (GoM-GBK), Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves. We analyzed time series from 1977 to 2016 in GoM-GBK, 1982 to 2016 in southwest GSL and 1999 to 2016 in remaining areas. Calanus finmarchicus dominated abundance and biomass, except in the GSL where Calanus hyperboreus was abundant. The biomass of Calanus spp. declined in many subregions over years 1999-2016 and was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature in GoM-GBK and on the SS. We detected ''regime shifts"" to lower biomass of Calanus spp. in the GoM-GBK in 2010 and on the SS in 2011. In the GoM-GBK, shifts to lower biomass of C. finmarchicus coincided with shifts to warmer ocean temperature and with published reports of changes in spatial distribution and reduced calving rate of NARW. We hypothesize that warming has negatively impacted population levels of Calanus spp. near their southern range limit, reducing the availability of prey to NARW. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Removing the vertical buoy lines used to mark traps on the sea floor and haul them up would dramatically reduce or eliminate entanglements, the leading cause of NARW mortality, while potentially allowing fishermen to harvest in areas that would otherwise need to be closed to protect whales. At the first annual Ropeless Consortium meeting, researchers, fishing industry representatives, manufacturers, conservationists, and regulators discussed existing and developing technological replacements for the marking and retrieval functions of buoy lines. Fishermen and NGO partners shared their experience demonstrating ropeless systems and provided feedback to improve the designs. U.S. and Canadian federal regulators discussed prospects to use ropeless fishing gear in areas closed to fishing with vertical lines, as well as other options to reduce entanglements, and a Massachusetts official shared additional regulatory considerations involved in ropeless fishing in state waters. Sustainable seafood experts discussed consumer market advantages and endangered, threatened, and protected species impacts in sustainability standards and certifications. Moving forward, there is an immediate need to (1) work with industry partners to iteratively test and improve ropeless retrieval and marking systems to adapt them to the specific conditions of the relevant trap/pot fisheries, (2) create data sharing and communications protocols for ropeless gear location marking, and (3) develop regulatory procedures and enforcement capacity to allow legal ropeless gear use. © 2019","Bycatch; Entanglement; Large whales; Ropeless fishing","bycatch; cetacean; environmental disturbance; fishing gear; marine policy; nongovernmental organization; regulatory framework; United States; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Werner, T.B., Moore, M.J., Urgent need for ropeless fishing: removing end lines to protect right whales (2019) Sea Technol.

Entanglement with fixed fishing gear is the most significant cause of mortality of North Atlantic right whales. There remains little documentation of how North Atlantic right whales become enwrapped during an encounter with fixed fishing gear. In order to gain a better understanding of how entanglements might occur, an interactive simulator was developed that allows the user to swim a virtual whale model using a standard game controller through a gear field in an attempt to re-create an entanglement. The morphologically accurate right whale model produces realistic swimming motions and is capable of pectoral fin motions in response to user input. Using the simulator, gear entanglements involving the pectoral flippers including ropes wrapping around the body and entanglements involving the tailstock were re-created. Entanglements involving the pectoral flippers with body wraps were more easily generated than entanglements involving the tailstock only. The simulator should aid scientists, fisheries experts, fishing gear designers, and bycatch reduction scientists in understanding entanglement dynamics and testing potential new gear configurations. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy","entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; fishing gear; North Atlantic right whale; simulation; wildlife management","bycatch; endangered species; fishing gear; mortality; nature conservation; simulation; swimming behavior; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"NA09NMF4520413, NA10NMF4520343

However, their regulations have failed to satisfy conservation and animal welfare concerns. From 1990 to 2011 the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis, NARW) population grew at a mean of 2.8% annually. However, population trends reversed since 2011; the species is in decline, with only 100 reproductively active females remaining. This failure is driven by vessel collisions and increasingly fatal and serious entanglement in fixed fishing gear, whose rope strength has increased substantially. Chronic entanglement, drag, and associated morbidity have been linked to poor fecundity. Genuine solutions involve designating areas to be avoided and speed restrictions for ships and removing fishing trap ropes from the water column. A trap fishing closure for NARW habitat in the Cape Cod Bay (U.S.) area has been in place seasonally since 2015. 2017 mortalities in Eastern Canada elicited substantive management changes whereby the 2018 presence of NARW in active trap fishing areas resulted in an effective closure. To avoid these costly closures, the traditional trap fishery model of rope end lines attached to surface marker buoys has to be modified so that traps are marked virtually, and retrieved with gear that does not remain in the water column except during trap retrieval. Consumer demand for genuinely whale-safe products will augment and encourage the necessary regulatory changes so that trap fisheries conserve target and nontarget species. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

Here, they rapidly accumulate and store energy obtained within a few months to support future migrations and reproduction while fasting. High drag from their ram-filter foraging strategy places a limit on what prey densities will be energetically efficient to target. Our understanding of the volume of prey-laden water filtered by right whales during a dive or foraging bout, and what information they use to decide to forage or not, has been limited by the difficulties of measuring when they feed at depth, how fast they swim during continuous ram filtration and how often they might swallow accumulated prey. We used 10 DTAG deployments from right whales in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to quantify swimming speeds and estimate the volume of prey-laden water filtered per dive. We used the tag's inertial sensors to evaluate the timing of frequent biomechanical changes that likely indicate the truncation of continuous filtration, and whether the number or timing of these fluking bouts relates to longer feeding dives or other foraging decisions. During foraging dives, right whales descended at 1.4 (±0.2 SD) m/s and slowed to swim at 1.1 (±0.3) m/s while filtering. We found consistent pauses in the fluking behaviour of foraging right whales, every 56 (±22) s. Whales filtered on average 78 (±30) m3 of water per fluking bout and on average 673 (±201) m3per dive. Right whales filter large volumes of water at low speeds with a high duty cycle, but require sufficiently high prey energy densities to compensate for a high-drag foraging strategy. Closely related bowhead whales have a larger gape but swim more slowly, filtering greater volumes with lower drag. Our findings highlight that right whales acquire their energy in a relatively short period of intense foraging; even moderate changes in their feeding behaviour or their prey energy density are likely to negatively impact their yearly energy budgets and therefore reduce fitness substantially.

However, manually matching photographs to known individuals is time-consuming. Motivated by recent developments in image recognition, we hosted a data science challenge on the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to automate the identification of endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). The winning solution automatically identified individual whales with 87% accuracy with a series of convolutional neural networks to identify the region of interest on an image, rotate, crop, and create standardized photographs of uniform size and orientation and then identify the correct individual whale from these passport-like photographs. Recent advances in deep learning coupled with this fully automated workflow have yielded impressive results and have the potential to revolutionize traditional methods for the collection of data on the abundance and distribution of wild populations. Presenting these results to a broad audience should further bridge the gap between the data science and conservation science communities. © 2018 The Authors.

In the Gulf of Maine, climate-driven changes have restructured the ecosystem rapidly over the past decade. Changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation have altered deepwater dynamics, driving warming rates twice as high as the fastest surface rates. This has had implications for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a critical food supply for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The oceanographic changes have driven a deviation in the seasonal foraging patterns of E. glacialis upon which conservation strategies depend, making the whales more vulnerable to ship strikes and gear entanglements. The effects of rapid climate-driven changes on a species at risk undermine current management approaches. © Author(s) 2019.",,,,,,,"OCE-1655686, OCE 1459133

Governments are required to demonstrate that they manage natural resources in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. Evidence of an environmental conservation problem is often not considered sufficient by government to warrant a change in the way human activities are managed until the problem becomes a societal crisis (e.g., large effects on economics, operations or infrastructure). Governments are then challenged to nimbly implement effective reactionary measures that both solve the problem and protect livelihoods. The mass mortality of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) that occurred over a 3 month period in Canadian waters in 2017 due at least in part to fishing gear entanglements and ship strike is an example of a situation wherein evidence of a growing conflict between whales and humans was not acted upon until it became an emergency. The disaster galvanized a number of recent federal environmental initiatives into a powerful government force that was able to collaborate with many non-government groups in promptly responding to the problem. This led to commendable implementation and enforcement of crisis management measures. However, implementation came after many mortalities had already occurred because management plans were developed extemporaneously. Further, the need for crisis management negatively impacted local communities and industries. The eventual implementation of federal regulations led to zero attributable right whale deaths and a profitable fishery in the area of highest whale densities the following year. This shows that government leaders can act effectively on issues of environmental conservation, but that these actions can be drastic (i.e., requiring significant and rapid change to human activities) if there is a historic lack of action to address chronic conservation problems. Being proactive requires acting in proportion to evidence, using plans that are adaptive, precautionary and based on science. Canada must now look to sustainable, preventative measures to reduce right whale mortality risk. © 2019 The Authors","Conservation; Entanglement; Fishing gear; North atlantic right whale; Risk; Ship strike; Shipping; Species at risk","collision; crisis management; endangered species; fishing gear; human activity; mortality risk; risk assessment; species conservation; whale; Canada; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Recovery Strategy for the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena Glacialis) in Atlantic Canadian Waters [Final].

This study quantifies the behavioral ontogeny of North Atlantic right whale mother-calf pairs from birth to weaning spanning three critical habitat areas off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Data from 55 focal follows of 34 mother-calf pairs were collected from 2011 to 2015. Resting behaviors dominated the activity budgets for both mother and calf during the first 5 months, putting them at increased risk of vessel collisions. There was an increase in the proportion of active behaviors (travel, foraging, social activity) in both mother and calf as the calf matured. Importantly, the type of active behaviors, in particular surface skim feeding and surface active social behavior, meant that the risk of vessel collision to the pair did not decrease as the calf matured. Mother-calf right whale pairs showed very low calling rates on the calving grounds, suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may not be an effective mitigation tool during the early months. However, calling rates increase once the pair leave the calving areas with both calf age and activity levels increasing, at which point passive acoustic monitoring becomes valuable. Protective measures need to take these rapid developmental changes throughout calf growth into account to improve the efficacy of protection measures for the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other species where behavioral ecology changes rapidly during maturation.

Laboratory experiments testing effects of oils on material strength and flexibility, particle capture and tissue architecture of baleen from four mysticete species (bowhead, Balaena mysticetus; North Atlantic right, Eubalaena glacialis; fin, Balaenoptera physalus; humpback, Megaptera novaeangliae) indicate that baleen is hydrophilic and oleophobic, shedding rather than adsorbing oil. Oils of different weights and viscosities were tested, including six petroleum-based oils and two fish or plankton oils of common whale prey. No notable differences were found by oil type or whale species. Baleen did not adsorb oil; oil was readily rinsed from baleen by flowing water, especially from moving fringes. Microscopic examination shows minimal wrinkling or peeling of baleen's cortical keratin layers, probably due to oil repelling infiltrated water. Combined results cast doubt on fears of baleen fouling by oil; filter porosity is not appreciably affected, but oil ingestion risks remain. Particle capture studies suggest potentially greater danger to mysticetes from plastic pollution than oil. © 2019 The Authors.

The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7–10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance. © 2019 Best, Halpin.

To mitigate this risk successfully, managers and conservationists must estimate risk across space, time, and alternative management policies. Evaluating this risk at fine spatial and temporal scales can be challenging, especially in systems where wildlife–vehicle collisions are rare or imperfectly detected. The sizes and behaviors of wildlife and vehicles influence collision risk, as well as how much they co-occur in space and time. We applied a modeling framework based on encounter theory to quantify the risk of lethal collisions between endangered North Atlantic right whales and vessels. Using Automatic Identification System vessel traffic data and spatially explicit estimates of right whale abundance that account for imperfect detection, we modeled risk at fine spatiotemporal scales before and after implementation of a vessel speed rule in the southeastern United States. The expected seasonal mortality rates of right whales decreased by 22% on average after the speed rule was implemented, indicating that the rule is effective at reducing lethal collisions. The rule's effect on risk was greatest where right whales were abundant and vessel traffic was heavy, and its effect varied considerably across time and space. Our framework is spatiotemporally flexible, process-oriented, computationally efficient and accounts for uncertainty, making it an ideal approach for evaluating many wildlife management policies, including those regarding collisions between wildlife and vehicles and cases in which wildlife may encounter other dangerous features such as wind farms, seismic surveys, or fishing gear. © 2019 The Authors.","encounter theory; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic right whale; spatial modeling; speed restrictions; speed zones; whale–vessel collision; wildlife–vehicle collision",,,,,,"U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC

Estimating the spatial distribution of Calanus spp. and understanding how it changes in response to environmental variability are crucial information requirements for mitigating risks to the right whale population. Here we present a new coupled dynamic model that builds on observations from the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) and statistical modelling of copepod spatial distributions using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The coupled model is initialized with the GAMs climatological abundance and explicitly represents transport of the two species C. finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus via particle tracking, considering Calanus vertical swimming behavior and along-track mortality and temperature-dependent development. Assessment of model performance and the role of advection in determining the modelled Calanus distributions is focused on the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL), an area regularly visited by right whales, and where local Calanus abundance is likely dependent on the seasonal transport from deep upstream areas. The coupled model simulates high Calanus abundance in the sGSL in summer and fall, distinct from the spatial distribution estimated by GAMs, which do not consider the effect of transport in the region. The exercise of building and testing this model allows us to investigate the factors producing high concentrations of late stage Calanus, and in the cases of model-data mismatch, infer important processes that are not adequately represented in the model. The model constitutes an important step forward in the ongoing effort to improve estimates of Calanus availability in the region, guiding future modelling efforts (e.g., a population development model) and potentially informing North Atlantic right whale management. © 2018","Calanus; Canada, Northwest Atlantic shelf, southern Gulf of St. Lawrence; Mathematical models; North Atlantic right whales; Population abundance; Transport processes; Zooplankton","Estimation; Mathematical models; Spatial distribution; Calanus; Northwest Atlantic; Population abundance; Right whales; Transport process; Zooplankton; Population distribution; abundance; abundance estimation; crustacean; ecological modeling; endangered species; environmental change; feeding; mortality; numerical model; prey availability; spatial distribution; swimming behavior; transport process; whale; zooplankton; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Saint Lawrence; West Antarctica; Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus hyperboreus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada","We are grateful to Rubao Ji and Pierre Pepin, who as participants in the 2017 Calanus Future Directions Research Workshop provided constructive feedback on this work.

Moreover, these biases may be variable owing to changes in behavior. We conducted focal follows to obtain surface and dive times of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) and measured the aircraft field of view; these metrics were combined to estimate availability and correct monthly abundance estimates from 1998 to 2017 generated via distance sampling methodology. We used a general least squares model to test for trends in abundance. Availability varied with month (0.27-0.85), likely linked to changes in the depth of copepod food resources. Detection probability varied across the years (0.43-0.87). Sightings per unit effort and counts of whales were significant, but downward-biased indicators of abundance and availability caused changes in bias over the season. Estimated abundance in CCB increased during the study period (4.9 whales yr-1), and estimated abundance in peak months increased at a faster rate (10% yr-1 for 1998-2017) than for the overall population (2.8% yr-1 for 1990-2010). Accurate abundance estimates are necessary to monitor long-term changes in abundance of right whales in CCB, to understand the importance of CCB relative to other areas, and improve management strategies to protect this endangered species from entanglements in fishing gear and ship-strikes. Failing to correct for seasonal variation in availability results in substantial and variable underestimation of abundance. © 2019.","Abundance estimation; Availability bias; Bayesian; Distance sampling; Diving; g(0); Right whales; Transect sampling","abundance; Bayesian analysis; diving behavior; population estimation; sampling; seasonal variation; transect; whale; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"National Geographic Society, NGS

These included 30 adults, 14 juveniles, 10 calves, and 16 of unknown age class. Females represented 65.5% (19/29) of known-sex adults. Fourteen cases had photos only; 56 carcasses received external examinations, 44 of which were also necropsied. Cause of death was determined in 43 cases, of which 38 (88.4%) were due to anthropogenic trauma: 22 (57.9%) from entanglement, and 16 (42.1%) from vessel strike. Gross and histopathologic lesions associated with entanglement were often severe and included deep lacerations caused by constricting line wraps around the flippers, flukes, and head/mouth; baleen plate mutilation; chronic extensive bone lesions from impinging line, and traumatic scoliosis resulting in compromised mobility in a calf. Chronically entangled whales were often in poor body condition and had increased cyamid burden, reflecting compromised health. Vessel strike blunt force injuries included skull and vertebral fractures, blubber and muscle contusions, and large blood clots. Propeller-induced wounds often caused extensive damage to blubber, muscle, viscera, and bone. Overall prevalence of NARW entanglement mortalities increased from 21% (1970−2002) to 51% during this study period. This demonstrates that despite mitigation efforts, entanglements and vessel strikes continue to inflict profound physical trauma and suffering on individual NARWs. These cumulative mortalities are also unsustainable at the population level, so urgent and aggressive intervention is needed to end anthropogenic mortality in this critically endangered species. © The authors 2019.","Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Morphology; Mortality; North Atlantic right whale; Pathology; Vessel strike · Necropsy","body condition; cause of death; detection method; disease prevalence; endangered species; histopathology; lesion; morphology; mortality; pathology; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Florida [United States]; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; United States; Cetacea; Cyamida; Eubalaena glacialis; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Cetacea; endangered species; female; Florida; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Endangered Species; Female; Florida; Whales",,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO: DFO-MAR-2016-02","In the USA, this investigative work was conducted under NOAA Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Permits 932-1489, 932-1905, 17355, and 18786. Canadian investigations were conducted under Section 73 SARA permits issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO-MAR-2016-02 Amendment 1) to relevant Canadian response organizations. Great thanks are owed to the NARW community and specifically the NARWC and its contributing membership for sharing data and expertise. This study only exists because of the work of stranding responders, volunteers, and government partners along the Northwest Atlantic seaboard who handle the overwhelming logistical challenge of towing, landing, transporting, and necropsying these whales. Additional thanks for necropsy and ancillary data are owed to Bob Bonde, Craig Harms, Lynda Doughty, Misty Niemeyer, Kristy Volker, Karen Sayles, Michael Walsh, Mendy Garron, Sean Todd, Jerry Conway, Jack Lawson, Wayne Ledwell, Robert Michaud, Stephane Lair, Stephanie Ratelle, Benjamin Lamglait, Andrew Reid, Wayne McFee, and James Powell. There was extensive support for the 2017 mortality event in Canada and additional people and organizations are acknowledged in the incident report (Daoust et al. 2017). The Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network responded to and provided data regarding entanglements of live and dead NARWs. Scott Landry (Center for Coastal Studies) provided entanglement reconstructions based on postmortem data as well as valuable comments on the manuscript. The aerial survey teams in both the USA and Canada (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Center for Coastal Studies, New England Aquarium, Sea to Shore Alliance, Florida Fish and Wildlife, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and others) provided live whale sightings data and carcass reports and tracking. Thanks to Allison Henry for edits to Table S1. The Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium analyzed and interpreted the fecal glucocorticoid data. Sophie Dennison, DACVR provided CT image interpretation. Thanks to Katie Gilbert and Kirsten Spray for their assistance with data organization and entry into the NARW necropsy database and Ashley Powell for her help with Canadian case study summaries. Gaia Bonini provided the ArcGIS maps. Funding for this case review study was provided in part by a grant from CINAR (NA14OAR432 0158). Necropsy and sample analysis expenses were funded by a combination of stranding network budgets, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, the Government of Canada Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk (MARS), and federal funds from NOAA MMHSRP and Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

Quantifying the nature and extent of the apparent shift is key to exploring this hypothesis and planning or revising conservation strategies. This paper characterizes decadal right whale occurrence in the Bay of Fundy summer feeding habitat using data derived from 7522 h of survey effort collected over 30 yr (1987 to 2016) that yielded 11 483 right whale sightings. Eight occurrence descriptors were derived to quantify temporal variation in right whale presence, encounter rates and time of arrival in the Bay. Time of arrival was modeled using linear and power function models fit to annual discovery curves. Principal component analysis showed 2 modes that explained 58 and 14% of the variation in occurrence, respectively. The first mode captured a significant decline in summertime right whale occurrence beginning in 2010. The second mode captured a decadal-scale cycle in seasonal timing of occurrence, which highlighted a sharp change from early to late occupancy at the turn of the millennium. Annual occurrence during the 2010-2016 period was anomalously low in both the Grand Manan Basin critical habitat and the Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Scheme (shipping lanes), whereas encounters in the region NW of the critical habitat containing Owen Basin and The Wolves islands may be increasing due to a distributional shift within the Bay. We discuss the consequences of these changes for both population dynamics and future conservation of the species. © The authors 2019.","Bay of Fundy; Calanus finmarchicus; Critical habitat; Foraging ecology; Habitat use; Immigration; North Atlantic right whale; Occurrence","crustacean; foraging behavior; habitat use; immigration; population dynamics; species occurrence; temporal variation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Bay of Fundy; Canada; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Canidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,"Acknowledgements.

Data from a year-round passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) network in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were exploited to build the time series of NARW incursions into this inland sea of the Northwest Atlantic, from June 2010 to November 2018. NARWs visited the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence every year from June to January, until ice freeze-up. The earliest detections were made at the end of April and the latest in mid-January. Call occurrence peaked between August and the end of October. NARW contact calls were not detected at the most upstream station at Les Escoumins, in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary, or at the northeastern connection of Belle Isle Strait with the Atlantic, which was monitored from November 2010 to November 2011. The mean daily occurrence of NARWs in the feeding grounds off Gaspé quadrupled after 2015 compared to 2011-2014. Long-term continuous PAM data provided invaluable information to document this marine mammal distribution shift. © The authors 2019.","Ecosystem shift; Eubalaena glacialis; Gaspé whale feeding ground; Passive acoustic monitoring","acoustics; detection method; endangered species; habitat structure; population distribution; species occurrence; whale; wildlife management; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Maine; Scotia Shelf; United States; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO

Clare, Ireland","North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) once occurred seasonally in Irish waters but in recent decades their presence has declined. This study reviews the existing literature to develop an understanding of the past distribution of North Atlantic right whales, their abundance, temporal occurrence, interspecies associations and apparent use of Irish waters. Ancillary information supporting these core aims was investigated to provide a context for the historical misidentification of North Atlantic right whales and the development of Irish whaling to evaluate the presence of this species in Irish waters. Records of the species within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), between 1300–1987 were validated based on the available data to three confidence levels: definite, probable and possible right whales. Seventeen records comprising at least 42 individual whales exist (including probable Basque whaling effort from the fourteenth century to the sixteenth century). Of the records available, 52% were considered ‘definitely’ right whales with eight comprising 22 individuals from two early twentieth century and two mid-seventeenth century commercial whaling stations operating in the northwest of Ireland. Six ‘probable’ right whale records involving 15 individuals were identified, including two sightings from the late twentieth century while two ‘possible’ records of five individuals were also noted. The previous importance of Ireland’s north western coastline as a potential early summer feeding area in the Northeast Atlantic for migrating right whales, along with the apparent extirpation of the species in the region are also discussed. © Royal Irish Academy.",,,,,,,,,,"Aguilar de Soto, N., The Canary Islands Cetacean Sighting Net, II (1999) European Research on Cetaceans 13.

Data from telemetry tags have shown that right whales can swim/feed at or near the seafloor. Because those data are limited, some uncertainty remains regarding the frequency of dives to the seafloor and thus the likelihood of right whale encounters with fishing ropes there. The North Atlantic right whale photo-identification catalog was used to determine the number of sightings of right whales with seafloor sediment on their bodies and the relative frequency and geographic location of those seafloor encounters. Between 1980 and 2016, there were 2053 detections of right whales with 'mud' on their bodies, which represents 2.9% of all sightings (n = 70 593), or 58.2% of all cataloged whales (n = 730). Although muddy right whales were found throughout their range and in all months, 92.7% of all detections occurred in the Bay of Fundy in the summer where there was an average annual detection rate of 7.3%, with a maximum of 26% of sightings in 2010. Mud was found on whales of all age classes including calves of the year, and equally among males and females. These seafloor encounters suggest that any rope resting on, or floating above, the seafloor could pose an entanglement hazard. The use of sinking groundlines likely reduces the risk of entanglements for whales swimming near the seafloor, but may not eliminate the risk for whales making contact with the sediment. © The authors 2019.","Bay of Fundy; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Mud; Right whale; Seafloor sediment","fishing gear; marine sediment; mud; seafloor; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,"Acknowledgements.

However, hormone assessment of whale respiratory vapor (blow) has been challenged by variable water content and unknown total volume of collected samples. To advance this technique, we investigated urea (a compound present in narrow range in circulation) as a normalizing factor to correct for blow sample concentration. Normalized progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol concentrations of 100 blow samples from 46 photo-identified North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were more biologically relevant compared to absolute estimates, varying by sex, age class, or individual. Progesterone was elevated in adult females compared with other cohorts and highest in one independently confirmed pregnant female. For both sexes, testosterone was two-fold higher in reproductively mature whales but studied adult females showed the widest variation. Cortisol was present in relatively low concentrations in blow and demonstrated variation between individual whales, suggesting potential for studies of individual differences in adrenal activity. Incorporation of methodologies that normalize sample concentration are essential for blow hormone analysis of free-swimming whales, and measurement of urea could be used to optimize non-invasive physiological assessment of whales. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"hydrocortisone; progesterone; testosterone; urea; animal; body fluid; breath analysis; Cetacea; chemistry; cohort analysis; exhalation; feces; female; male; metabolism; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; reproduction; respiratory system; Animals; Body Fluids; Breath Tests; Cohort Studies; Exhalation; Feces; Female; Hydrocortisone; Male; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Reproduction; Respiratory System; Testosterone; Urea; Whales",,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; progesterone, 57-83-0; testosterone, 58-22-0; urea, 57-13-6; Hydrocortisone; Progesterone; Testosterone; Urea",,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR

Their abundance slowly increased up until 2010, to a maximum of fewer than 500 whales, and since then they have been in decline. We assessed the extent to which the relatively slow increase demonstrated by NARW was intrinsic, and how much could be due to anthropogenic impacts. In order to do so, we first compared calf counts of three populations of Southern right whales (SRW), E. australis, with that of NARW, over the period 1992–2016. By this index, the annual rate of increase of NARW was approximately one-third of that of SRW. Next we constructed a population projection model for female NARW, using the highest annual survival estimates available from recent mark–resight analysis, and assuming a four-year calving interval. The model results indicated an intrinsic rate of increase of 4% per year, approximately twice that observed, and that adult female mortality is the main factor influencing this rate. Necropsy records demonstrate that anthropogenic mortality is the primary cause of known mortality of NARW. Anthropogenic mortality and morbidity has limited the recovery of NARW, and baseline conditions prior to their recent decline were already jeopardizing NARW recovery. & 2018 The Authors Published b the Ro al Societ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License","Entanglement mortality; Geographical comparison; Population projection model; Whale conservation",,,,,,,"Data accessibility.

This is hardly surprising considering the difficulties in finding and provenancing products made of organic matter. In this article we examine gaming pieces made from bone and antler, which are not unusual in Scandinavian burials in the Vendel and Viking period (c. ad 550-1050). A special emphasis is placed on whalebone pieces that appear to dominate after around ad 550, signalling a large-scale production and exploitation of North Atlantic whale products. In combination with other goods such as bear furs, birds of prey, and an increased iron and tar production, whalebone products are part of an intensified large-scale outland exploitation and indicate strong, pre-urban trading routes across Scandinavia and Europe some 200 years before the Viking period and well before the age of the emporia. © European Association of Archaeologists 2018Â This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is unaltered and is properly cited.

The seasonal occurrence remained relatively unchanged during the study, spanning the January through mid-May timeframe. The number of individual whales visiting the Bay was positively correlated with the increasing Best Cataloged Estimate (BCE), the number of photographed whales alive, with a maximum in 2011 of 56.9% (n = 277) of BCE. However, the rate of increase in number of individuals during the study was significantly greater than that of the BCE (difference in slope: 12.72; P < 0.01) suggesting that increased visitation to the Bay was due in part to a change in habitat preference. Although the demographic composition of whales observed during the study differed little from that of the cataloged whales, the proportion of calves born in the North Atlantic that were documented in the Bay increased significantly (P < 0.01). Models of random visitation demonstrated an individual preference for or rejection of the Bay by the right whales of the North Atlantic population. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy","aerial survey; behavior; Cape Cod Bay; cow/calf pairs; demography; distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; habitat preference; right whale","aerial survey; behavioral response; demography; habitat selection; migratory behavior; population distribution; preference behavior; species occurrence; whale; Cape Cod Bay; Massachusetts; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: 14603, 633-1483-04, 633-1483-01, 633-1483-02 (2002, 633-1763-0, 633-1763-01 (2009","This study was carried out under NOAA Scientific Permits to Take Marine Mammals No 1014 (1998–1999), No 633-1483-01 (1999–2001), No 633-1483-02 (2002), No 633-1483-04 (2003–2005), No 633-1763-0 (2005–2008), No 633-1763-01 (2009), and No 14603 (2009–2013).

All three species (Eubalaena australis, Eubalaena japonica and Eubalaena glacialis) are CITES listed (Appendix I), with the latter two species listed as endangered (IUCN, v 2017-1). The mitochondrial genome of the first two species have been sequenced and are publicly available, while E. glacialis was unavailable. Here we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of E. glacialis, while also detailing a straight forward mitochondrial enrichment method that facilitates analysis using next generation sequencing. This method simultaneously allows for efficient sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, while demonstrating quality sequence coverage that is even across the genome. This enrichment illustrates a marked improvement in sequence depth compared to that achieved when performing whole genome sequencing using a standard DNA extraction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bioinformatics; Eubalaena glacialis; Mitochondrial enrichment; Mitochondrial genome; Next generation sequencing",,,,,,"North Carolina State University, NCSU","Funding Stranding response and sample collection was assisted with funding from the John.

Grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) disappeared from the entire North Atlantic in still-mysterious circumstances. Here, we test the hypotheses that both species previously occurred in the Mediterranean Sea, an area not currently considered part of their historical range. We used ancient DNA barcoding and collagen fingerprinting methods to taxonomically identify a rare set of 10 presumed whale bones from Roman and pre-Roman archaeological sites in the Strait of Gibraltar region, plus an additional bone from the Asturian coast. We identified three right whales, and three grey whales, demonstrating that the ranges of both of these species historically encompassed the Gibraltar region, probably including the Mediterranean Sea as calving grounds. Our results significantly extend the known range of the Atlantic grey whale, and suggest that 2000 years ago, right and grey whales were common when compared with other whale species. The disappearance of right and grey whales from the Mediterranean region is likely to have been accompanied by broader ecosystem impacts, including the disappearance of their predators (killer whales) and a reduction in marine primary productivity. The evidence that these two coastal and highly accessible species were present along the shores of the Roman Empire raises the hypothesis that they may have formed the basis of a forgotten whaling industry. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

It is part of the migratory ranges of a number of cetacean species, and includes threats from ship strikes, noise exposure, and line entanglements. Previous cetacean surveys of the Bight offer limited information on cetacean occurrence and distribution in the region, having been restricted to visual sightings with limited temporal coverage. A passive acoustic monitoring survey was conducted over a 258-day period to broaden understanding of the seasonal occurrences of blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales during late summer, autumn, winter, and early spring. Stationary acoustic recorders were positioned near the entrance to New York Harbour and as a linear transect extending from Long Island to the continental shelf edge. Blue, fin, and right whales were detected on 11%, 100%, and 16% of the survey days, respectively. Blue whales were detected offshore during January, February, and March. Fin whales were detected offshore every day, and less often near-shore. Right whales occurred sporadically during every month, but were most often detected at near-shore recorders between late February and mid-May. Based on the acoustic data alone, it is unclear exactly how these species are using this habitat, although it is clear that they occur in the area longer than was previously thought. Thus, management practices should incorporate this extended seasonal presence to mitigate any effects on the whales from shipping and fishing activities.

Entanglements in fixed fishing gear represent a particularly pervasive and often drawn-out source of anthropogenic morbidity and mortality to the species. To better understand both the physiological response to entanglement, and to determine fundamental parameters such as acquisition, duration, and severity of entanglement, we measured a suite of biogeochemical markers in the baleen of an adult female that died from a well-documented chronic entanglement in 2005 (whale Eg2301). Steroid hormones (cortisol, corticosterone, estradiol, and progesterone), thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)), and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) were all measured in a longitudinally sampled baleen plate. This yielded an 8-year profile of foraging and migration behavior, stress response, and reproduction. Stable isotopes cycled in annual patterns that reflect the animal's north-south migration behavior and seasonally abundant zooplankton diet. A progesterone peak, lasting approximately 23 months, was associated with the single known calving event (in 2002) for this female. Estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, T3, and T4 were also elevated, although variably so, during the progesterone peak. This whale was initially sighted with a fishing gear entanglement in September 2004, but the hormone panel suggests that the animal first interacted with the gear as early as June 2004. Elevated δ15N, T3, and T4 indicate that Eg2301 potentially experienced increased energy expenditure, significant lipid catabolism, and thermal stress approximately 3 months before the initial sighting with fishing gear. All hormones in the panel (except cortisol) were elevated above baseline by September 2004. This novel study illustrates the value of using baleen to reconstruct recent temporal profiles and as a comparative matrix in which key physiological indicators of individual whales can be used to understand the impacts of anthropogenic activity on threatened whale populations. © 2018 Lysiak, Trumble, Knowlton and Moore.","Baleen; Entantlement; Right whale; Stable isotopes; Steroid hormones; Thyroid hormones",,,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Gimenez, J., Gomez-Campos, E., Cardona, L., Borrell, A., d15N value does not reflect fasting in mysticetes (2014) PLoS ONE, 9; Aitken, R.J., Aspects of delayed implantation in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (1981) J.

One management tool to protect endangered North Atlantic right whales is a 460-m distance restriction rule for all vessels. This study is the first effort to analyze factors that influence recreational boaters’ intentions to comply with this regulation. Using the theory of planned behavior, we analyzed 362 mail surveys of recreational boaters using the offshore waters of the southeastern United States. We found that two constructs of the theory significantly explained 58% of the intention to comply with the rule: (1) positive attitude toward the rule and (2) stronger belief that other people are complying. Boaters recommended increasing knowledge about whales to improve compliance, but they were divided with respect to increasing fines for violators to increase compliance. This information can be useful for designing outreach strategies to protect whales. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Intentions to comply; management; public perceptions; theory of planned behavior","boating; compliance; endangered species; management; perception; regulatory framework; species conservation; whale; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,"University of Florida, UF

The Basques pioneered commercial whaling first in the neighbouring Cantabrian Sea (11th century) and then in Newfoundland and Labrador (16th century). The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is believed to have been the main target species of the Cantabrian fleets off the coast of Spain although other large whale species could have occasionally been targeted. At present, no molecular identification study has been performed to corroborate which species constituted the main catch for local whalers. Here we use historical bone remains to identify the main target species of medieval whaling in the Cantabrian Sea (13–18th centuries). Our results confirm the North Atlantic right whale as the main target species in Iberia suggesting that direct hunting could have played a role in the depletion of the species. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cantabrian Sea; DNA; Eubalaena glacialis; Gray whale; North Atlantic right whale; Whaling",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT: PTDC/BIA BIC/4177/2012","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [grant number PTDC/BIA BIC/4177/2012 ]; and the Grupo de Acción Costeira GAC-7 Ría de Vigo-A Guarda .",,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 10, pp. 191-199; Alter, S.E., Meyer, M., Post, K., Czechowski, P., Gravlund, P., Gaines, C., Rosenbaum, H.C., Van der Plicht, J., Climate impacts on transocean dispersal and habitat in gray whales from the Pleistocene to 2100 (2015) Mol.

Although marine mammals exhibit highly complex and diverse communication signals, asking similar questions about signal development can be challenging when dealing with long-lived species that roam widely at sea. North Atlantic right whales, a large baleen whale species, are intensely studied due to their endangered status. We examine whether right whale acoustic signals vary with the physical and social development of individuals from birth to adulthood using a latitudinal analysis. Data included 986 high-quality calls recorded from 49 individuals of known age spanning from 1 month to 37 years, with two individuals measured at different ages. Calls produced by calves younger than 1 year were easily distinguished by their short duration, a high degree of frequency modulation and a high percentage of nonlinear phenomena. Nonlinear phenomena within calls shifted from disorder (deterministic chaos) to increased control (biphonation and subharmonics) with increasing age. The overall percentage of calls containing nonlinear phenomena decreased with increasing age. Duration of the calls and calling bouts increased in direct correlation with age. Notably there was no clear indication of fixation in any of the measured parameters with age, with directional changes continuing over the entire age range studied. This study presents the first evidence that acoustic maturation does not stop at sexual maturity (∼9 years) in right whales and that refinement of calls continues through adulthood. Clear age-related voice cues have been documented in a range of terrestrial species with increases in call duration often reflecting increased stamina or condition in older adults. This study shows a similar trend in right whale sound production, with changes detectable across three-decade age range of available data. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","call duration; nonlinear phenomena; vocal development; vocal maturity; voice characteristics","age structure; calling behavior; marine mammal; maturation; sexual maturity; signal; vocalization; whale; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti; Vertebrata",,,,,"International Fund for Animal Welfare, IFAW

As a strategy for coping with unfavorable near-surface conditions, Calanus enter diapause and migrate to deep water in late summer and fall after feeding and accumulating lipid stores in spring and summer. In order to assess the most important physical drivers of vertical distribution of diapausing Calanus, we synthesized existing depth-stratified abundance data of Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus from the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope regions, spanning Newfoundland in the northeast to the Gulf of Maine in the southwest. Bottom depth strongly constrained the depth and shape of vertical distributions, with distributions becoming deeper and less compact as bottom depth increased. Diapausing Calanus, observed across a broad range of temperature (T) and in-situ density (σ) conditions (T = −1.0 to 14.4 °C, σ = 25.3–28.1 kg m−3), tended to distribute at depths with the coldest temperatures locally available. Over the shelf, diapausing Calanus in the GOM and SS generally did not have access to temperatures considered optimal for diapause (&lt;5 °C), in many cases occurring at temperatures well above this threshold. Diapausing Calanus in both habitats were most commonly below the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), a feature formed through wind-driven mixing during the winter, but this effect was more obvious over the shelf than in slope waters. Our analysis highlights key differences in the vertical distributions of diapausing Calanus over the shelf vs. the slope, having regional implications for ecological dynamics and population persistence in the face of warming temperatures. In general, understanding factors that influence vertical distributions of diapausing Calanus will allow us to more accurately predict how the environmental conditions they encounter while overwintering may shift during climate change, which has implications for survival through diapause, and consequently, shelf-wide population dynamics. © 2018","Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus hyperboreus; Cold intermediate layer; Convective mixing; Density; Diapause; Dormancy; Light attenuation; Northwest Atlantic; Overwintering; Temperature; Vertical distribution","Climate change; Density (specific gravity); Ecology; Mammals; Mixing; Temperature; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cold intermediate layers; Convective mixing; Diapause; Dormancy; Light attenuation; Northwest Atlantic; Overwintering; Vertical distributions; Population distribution; aquatic organism; continental shelf; continental slope; crustacean; deep water; diapause; dormancy; ecosystem dynamics; environmental conditions; habitat type; light attenuation; mixing; overwintering; population density; population dynamics; seasonal variation; survival; vertical distribution; whale; wild population; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus hyperboreus; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: OCE-1459087, OCE-1459092","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grants OCE-1459087 and OCE-1459092 ] to J.R., and N.R.R., Bigelow Laboratory institutional funds to N.R.R, and by funds from Fisheries and Oceans Canada Species at Risk Management to C.L.J.

The estimated abundance as of 2016 was 451 animals. After 20 yr of relatively steady but slow growth, the population has declined since 2010. Mortality and serious injury from entanglement in commercial fishing gear have had a significant impact on recovery. Despite legal requirements to reduce fishery-related mortality, little or no real progress has been made over the last 2 decades. Here I took a relatively simple approach to estimate what the population trajectory since 1990 might have been under 4 different scenarios of reduced entanglement mortality. Under the best-case scenarios, the population at the end of the time-series would have been 25-30% higher than observed at present. If the population had not experienced nearly 3 decades of increasing entanglement, it could have been much more resilient to a disaster year like 2017. © The authors 2018.","Entanglement mortality; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic right whale; Population decline","endangered species; injury; mortality; population decline; population dynamics; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Cooke, J.G., Eubalaena glacialis (2018) IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2018. , https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41712/50380891; Hamilton, P.K., Knowlton, A.K., Marx, M.K., Right whales tell their own stories: the photo-identification catalog (2009) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, pp. 75-104. , In: Kraus SD, Rolland RM (eds), Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Hatch, L.T., Clark, C.W., Van Parijs, S.M., Frankel, A., Ponirakis, D., Quantifying loss of acoustic communication space for right whales in and around a U.S. National Marine Sanctuary (2012) Conserv Biol, 26, pp. 983-994; Hayes, S.A., Josephson, E., Maze-Foley, K., Rosel, P.E., (2018) US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Marine Mammal Stock Assessments-2017, , NOAA Tech Memo NMFS NE-245.

Understanding temporal distribution is particularly important, because a portion of the population migrates between high-latitude summer feeding grounds off the northeastern US and Canadian Maritimes coasts and lower-latitude calving and wintering grounds off the southeastern US coast (SEUS). Here, we modeled SEUS residence patterns using photo-identification data from coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida from 7 winter seasons (2004/2005-2010/2011). We used multistate open robust design models to evaluate effects of reproductive status, demographic group, and environmental conditions on SEUS residence. Model estimates accounted for temporal variation and imperfect detection and provided probabilities of entering the SEUS, staying in the SEUS, and being sighted in the SEUS. We also derived estimates for residence time and seasonal abundance. We observed staggered arrival and departure patterns and demographic differences in residence patterns that are characteristic of a differential migration strategy. Calving females arrived ear liest and, in most seasons, had mean residence periods more than twice as long as other demographic groups. Conversely, adult males arrived the latest and had the shortest residence times. Within-season detection was positively influenced by survey effort, and overall seasonal mean (±SE) detection rate estimates ranged from 0.83 ± 0.08 for non-calving adult females to 0.98 ± 0.02 for calving females. Results provide insights into right whale behavior, biology, and temporal distribution in the SEUS and can be used to evaluate spatially and temporally dynamic management measures. © The authors 2018.","Eubalaena glacialis; Mark-recapture; North Atlantic right whale; Open robust design; Phenology; Residence","Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Save the Manatee Trust Fund, STMTF","Acknowledgements.

The vessel speed restriction that is part of the RWSAS presents navigation stakeholders with numerous challenges, owing to concerns about increased risks of ship grounding and collisions within ports. In this paper, we present a multi-methodology framework for assessing the impact of the vessel speed restriction on navigational safety. Empirically, we base our discussion in a first-order analysis of ship grounding risk for the Charleston Entrance Channel. Our analysis proceeds in three parts. We begin by using fault and event tree analyses to assess a relevant set of grounding-related event progression and failure probabilities. The influence of alternative vessel speed restrictions on ship grounding risk are then explored via a Bayesian network model that utilises the previously specified fault and event tree models for its partial specification and enumeration. Our analysis suggests that the speed restriction can, under certain reasonable assumptions, be seen to adversely impact the risk of ship grounding accidents in the Charleston Entrance Channel. We conclude with a summary of our findings and recommendations for future research.

Beaver St., PO Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ  86001, United States","Baleen tissue accumulates stress hormones (glucocorticoids, GC) as it grows, along with other adrenal, gonadal and thyroid hormones. The hormones are deposited in a linear fashion such that a single plate of baleen allows retrospective assessment and evaluation of long-term trends in the whales' physiological condition. In whale calves, a single piece of baleen contains hormones deposited across the lifespan of the animal, with the tip of the baleen representing prenatally grown baleen. This suggests that baleen recovered from stranded carcasses of whale calves could be used to examine lifetime patterns of stress physiology. Here we report lifetime profiles of cortisol and corticosterone in baleen of a North Atlantic right whale ('NARW'-Eubalaena glacialis) calf that died from a vessel strike, as well as four southern right whale ('SRW'-Eubalaena australis) calves that were found dead with varying severity of chronic wounding from Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) attacks. In all five calves, prenatally grown baleen exhibited a distinctive profile of elevated glucocorticoids that declined shortly before birth, similar to GC profiles reported from baleen of pregnant females. After birth, GC profiles in calf baleen corresponded with the degree of wounding. The NARW calf and two SRW calves with no or few gull wounds had relatively low and constant GC content throughout life, while two SRW calves with high numbers of gull wounds had pronounced elevations in baleen GC content in postnatal baleen followed by a precipitous decline shortly before death, a profile suggestive of prolonged chronic stress. Baleen samples may present a promising and valuable tool for defining the baseline physiology of whale calves and may prove useful for addressing conservation-relevant questions such as distinguishing acute from chronic stress and, potentially, determining cause of death. © The Author(s) 2018.","Baleen;

One of the more insidious effects of elevated noise levels is the reduction in area over which animals are able to acoustically communicate, often termed communication masking. This study utilizes modeling approaches to evaluate relative levels of masking for 4 baleen whale species from the combination of current ambient noise conditions and noise from discrete vessels operating in the Stellwagen Bank Nat - ional Marine Sanctuary. Acoustic data were collected using bottom-mounted autonomous recorders. One day was analyzed for each of 5 different species-specific sound types, corresponding to peaks in occurrence of fin and humpback whale songs, humpback whale social sounds, minke whale pulse trains and North Atlantic right whale gunshots. Source levels for animals and 3 categories of vessels were calculated empirically; sound propagation was modeled using Bellhop ray tracing. An agent-based modeling framework was used to calculate changes in communication space (CS) in comparison to reference conditions (10 dB lower than current ambient noise). In these singleday snapshots, current ambient noise and noise from vessels for which automatic identification system (AIS) data were available contribute most heavily to loss of CS, followed by whale-watching and fishing vessels. Right whale gunshots experience the least amount of masking, while fin, humpback and minke whale signals experience masking levels of 80% or more. While these results incorporate several simplifying assumptions, this study further develops the framework by which to comparatively quantify masking, providing information on the relative degree of masking experienced between species and allowing for important insights on the relative contributions of different anthropogenic sound sources. © The authors 2017.","Anthropogenic noise; Baleen whales; Communication masking; Communication space","ambient noise; bioacoustics; fishing vessel; marine park; modeling; signaling; whale; Massachusetts; Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; United States; Animalia; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Barber, J.R., Crooks, K.R., Fristrup, K.M., The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms (2010) Trends Ecol Evol, 25, pp. 180-189; Bass, A.H., Clark, C.W., (2003) The physical acoustics of underwater sound communication, pp. 15-64. , In: Simmons AM, Fay RR, Popper AN (eds) Acoustic communication.

However, failing to recognize the additional role of environmental factors in regulating birth and mortality rates can lead to erroneous demographic analyses and conclusions. The North Atlantic right whale population is currently the focus of conservation efforts aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Consistent monitoring of the population since 1980 has revealed evidence that climate-associated changes in prey availability have played an important role in the population's recovery. The considerable interdecadal differences observed in population growth coincide with remote Arctic and North Atlantic oceanographic processes that link to the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Here, we build capture-recapture models to quantify the role of prey availability on right whale demographic transitional probabilities and use a corresponding demographic model to project population growth rates into the next century. Contrary to previous predictions, the right whale population is projected to recover in the future as long as prey availability and mortality rates remain within the ranges observed during 1980–2012. However, recent events indicate a northward range shift in right whale prey, potentially resulting in decreased prey availability and/or an expansion of right whale habitat into unprotected waters. An annual increase in the number of whale deaths comparable to that observed during the summer 2017 mass mortality event may cause a decline to extinction even under conditions of normal prey availability. This study highlights the importance of understanding the oceanographic context for observed population changes when evaluating the efficacy of conservation management plans for endangered marine species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","capture–recapture; conservation; demography; endangered species; Eubalaena glacialis; marine ecology; population modeling; right whale","anthropogenic effect; demography; endangered species; marine ecosystem; mortality; population modeling; species conservation; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; climate change; ecosystem; endangered species; population dynamics; population growth; uncertainty; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Uncertainty; Whales",,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD","National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship; Cornell’s Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, through its Sustainable Biodiversity Fund","The authors thank the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium for access to the population data analyzed and reported in this paper.

Potential inﬂuences of stress or adrenal stress hormones (cortisol, corticosterone) on male reproduction have also been diﬃcult to study. Baleen has recently been shown to accumulate steroid hormones during growth, such that a single baleen plate contains a continuous, multi-year retrospective record of the whale's endocrine history. As a preliminary investigation into potential testosterone cyclicity in male whales and inﬂuences of stress, we determined patterns in immunoreactive testosterone, two glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone), and stable-isotope (SI) ratios, across the full length of baleen plates from a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), a North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), all adult males. Baleen was subsampled at 2 cm (bowhead, right) or 1 cm (blue) intervals and hormones were extracted from baleen powder with methanol, followed by quantiﬁcation of all three hormones using enzyme immunoassays validated for baleen extract of these species. Baleen of all three males contained regularly spaced peaks in testosterone content, with number and spacing of testosterone peaks corresponding well to SI data and to species-speciﬁc estimates of annual baleen growth rate. Cortisol and corticosterone exhibited some peaks that co-occurred with testosterone peaks, while other glucocorticoid peaks occurred independent of testosterone peaks. The right whale had unusually high glucocorticoids during a period with a known entanglement in ﬁshing gear and a possible disease episode; in the subsequent year, testosterone was unusually low. Further study of baleen testosterone patterns in male whales could help clarify conservation- and management-related questions such as age of sexual maturity, location and season of breeding, and the potential eﬀect of anthropogenic and natural stressors on male testosterone cycles. © The Author(s) 2018.

In coastal areas, marine mammals face numerous anthropogenic threats such as marine traffic and commercial fishing. The objective of this study was to investigate marine mammal stranding records from the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) and the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NWGSL), Quebec, Canada from 1994 to 2008 for evidence of anthropogenic trauma caused by entanglement in fishing gear, ship collisions and gunshots. Of 1,590 marine mammal stranding records, 12% (n = 192) had evidence of anthropogenic trauma, most incidents being reported during summer when activities such as marine traffic, most commercial fishing and recreational boating, occurred and a greater number of species were present in the area. These incidents were classified into five categories (Incidental catch, Ship collision, Severe injury, Gunshot, Other). There were 1,245 mortalities and observations on carcasses suggested that anthropogenic trauma led to the death of 11% (141/1,245) of marine mammals: 14% (87/627) of cetaceans and 9% (54/618) of seals. Mortality of seals due to anthropogenic trauma was low, involving mainly Gunshot for grey (26% or 8/31) and harbour seals (26% or 8/31). Over the study period, marine mammal incidents with evidence of anthropogenic trauma increased significantly, driven by an increase in Incidental catch for two mysticete species, the common minke whale, 42% (39/92) and humpback whale, 13% (12/92) and Other for harbour porpoise 67% (16/24). Ship collision was the most common anthropogenic trauma for fin whales (22% or 8/36) and SLE beluga5 (22% or 8/36). Severe injury was reported for 22% (2/9) of small cetaceans and 78% (7/9) of seals. Evidence from some harbour porpoise stranding records (categorised as Other) suggests illegal hunting, incidental catch, predation or scavenging by grey seals in a marine protected area. The observed increase in Incidental catch of common minke and humpback whales may be due to: (1) a shift in distribution of these two species into the SLE and NWGSL, possibly related to changes in the ecosystem; (2) changes in fishery practices; and (3) an increase in detection of marine mammal strandings. Anthropogenic trauma affecting marine mammals was documented including some species at risk, such as the harbour porpoise, the St. Lawrence Estuary beluga population, blue and North Atlantic right whales, in the St. Lawrence ecosystem including in a marine protected area. This study demonstrates the usefulness of stranding records in helping to monitor human-caused mortality in marine mammal populations. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

We investigated whether multi-year longitudinal records of glucocorticoids can be reconstructed from serial sampling along full-length baleen plates (representing ∼10 years of baleen growth), using baleen recovered from two female North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of known reproductive history. Cortisol and corticosterone were quantified with immunoassay of subsamples taken every 4 cm (representing ∼60 d time intervals) along a full-length baleen plate from each female. In both whales, corticosterone was significantly elevated during known pregnancies (inferred from calf sightings and necropsy data) as compared to intercalving intervals; cortisol was significantly elevated during pregnancies in one female but not the other. Within intercalving intervals, corticosterone was significantly elevated during the first year (lactation year) and/or the second year (post-lactation year) as compared to later years of the intercalving interval, while cortisol showed more variable patterns. Cortisol occasionally showed brief high elevations (“spikes”) not paralleled by corticosterone, suggesting that the two glucocorticoids might be differentially responsive to certain stressors. Generally, immunoreactive corticosterone was present in higher concentration in baleen than immunoreactive cortisol; corticosterone:cortisol ratio was usually >4 and was highly variable in both individuals. Further investigation of baleen cortisol and corticosterone profiles could prove fruitful for elucidating long-term, multi-year patterns in stress physiology of large whales, determined retrospectively from stranded or archived specimens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Baleen hormones; Cetacea; Corticosterone; Cortisol; Marine mammals; Stress","corticosterone; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; corticosterone; hydrocortisone; adult; Article; Cetacea; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; Eubalaena glacialis; female; gestation period; growth rate; hormone determination; hydrocortisone blood level; immunoassay; immunoreactivity; lactation; nonhuman; priority journal; anatomy and histology; animal; animal structures; longitudinal study; metabolism; pregnancy; reproducibility; Animal Structures; Animals; Corticosterone; Female; Glucocorticoids; Hydrocortisone; Longitudinal Studies; Pregnancy; Reproducibility of Results; Whales",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Corticosterone; Glucocorticoids; Hydrocortisone",,,"Eppley Foundation for Research

Eubalaena glacialis) population in recent years, an improved understanding of spatio-temporal movements are imperative for the conservation of this species. While so far visual data have provided most information on NARW movements, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used in this study in order to better capture year-round NARW presence. This project used PAM data from 2004 to 2014 collected by 19 organizations throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, data from 324 recorders (35,600 days) were processed and analyzed using a classification and detection system. Results highlight almost year-round habitat use of the western North Atlantic Ocean, with a decrease in detections in waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in summer and fall. Data collected post 2010 showed an increased NARW presence in the mid-Atlantic region and a simultaneous decrease in the northern Gulf of Maine. In addition, NARWs were widely distributed across most regions throughout winter months. This study demonstrates that a large-scale analysis of PAM data provides significant value to understanding and tracking shifts in large whale movements over long time scales. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"acoustics; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; geography; population dynamics; spatial analysis; Acoustics; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Geography; Population Dynamics; Spatial Analysis; Whales",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

We conducted a study of right whale foraging ecology by attaching tags to whales for short periods of time (hours), tracking their movements during daytime, and repeatedly sampling oceanographic conditions and prey distribution along the whales' tracks. Right whales were tagged from late winter to late fall in 6 regions of the Gulf of Maine and southwestern Scotian Shelf from 2000 to 2010. The diving behavior of the tagged whales was governed by the vertical distribution of their primary prey, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. On average, right whales tagged during spring spent 72% of their time in the upper 10 m (within the draft of most large commercial vessels), indicating the need for expanded ship speed restrictions in western Gulf of Maine springtime habitats. One out of every 4 whales dove to within 5 m of the sea floor during the short time they were tagged, spending as much as 45% of their total tagged time in this depth stratum. Right whales dove to the sea floor in each habitat studied except for one (where only 1 whale was tagged). This relatively high incidence of near-bottom diving raises serious concerns about the continued use of floating ground lines in pot and trap gear in coastal Maine and Canadian waters. © M. F.

The E. glacialis rod visual pigment absorbs light maximally at 493 nm, while microspectrophotometric measurements of the C. finmarchicus carotenoid pigments reveal transmission spectra with minima matching very well with the E. glacialis rod visual pigment absorbance spectra maximum. Springtime spectral downwelling irradiance and horizontal radiance values from the surface waters of Cape Cod Bay and at all depths in Great South Channel overlap the E. glacialis rod absorbance spectrum, allowing C. finmarchicus to appear as a high-contrast dark silhouette against a bright background spacelight, thus facilitating visually guided contrast foraging. In contrast, spectral downwelling irradiance and horizontal radiance at depth in Cape Cod Bay, and all depths in Wilkinson Basin, do not overlap the E. glacialis rod absorbance spectrum, providing little if any useful light for contrast vision. © 2017 Society for Marine Mammalogy","Calinus finmarchicus; downwelling irradiance spectrum; Eubalaena glacialis; foraging ecology; horizontal radiance spectrum; vision","carotenoid; crustacean; foraging behavior; irradiance; spectrophotometry; visual cue; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cape Cod Bay; Gulf of Maine; Massachusetts; United States; Wilkinson Basin; Calanoida; Calanus finmarchicus; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Brandeis University

The management of entanglements of large whales, such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), with commercial fisheries, is a challenge given the species’ small population size, economic consequences of regulations, and the general lack of data on entanglements. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requires development of programs to limit marine mammal entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Following a retrospective look at implementing aspects of the MMPA, a set of guiding principles were developed with associated best practices useful in reducing fatal large whale entanglement in fishing gear. Among these are: 1) involve stakeholders early in the decision making process; 2) establish a transparent management strategy that includes critical needs to guide research; 3) use a variety of tools such as an established process for receiving new information and ideas; and 4) incorporate adaptive management which considers the constraints of dynamic (rapid) changes to some fixed fishing gear. Efforts to reduce worldwide marine mammal bycatch will typically occur in a data-limited environment as experienced with U.S. Atlantic large whale entanglements. The guiding principles will remain as key tools for reducing large whale bycatch in fisheries as they build upon common practices. These insights developed over two decades of management can potentially help others to address similar bycatch problems. © 2017","Bycatch; Fishing; Guiding principles; Management; Marine mammals","adaptive management; bycatch; fishing; fishing gear; marine policy; stakeholder; whale; United States; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Read, A.J., Drinker, P., Northridge, S., Bycatch of marine mammals in U.S. and global fisheries (2006) Conserv.

Elevated GC concentrations in feces (fGC) are known to reflect stressful disturbances, such as fishing gear entanglement and human-generated underwater noise, in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, there can be considerable variation in GC production as a function of sex and life history stage, which may confound the interpretation of fGC levels. Additionally, GC antibodies used in immunoassays can cross-react with other fecal metabolites (i.e., non-target steroids), potentially influencing fGC data. Here, aldosterone concentrations (fALD; aldosterone and related metabolites) were measured in fecal samples from right whales (total n = 315 samples), including samples from identified individuals of known life history (n = 82 individual whales), to evaluate its utility as a complementary biomarker to fGC for identifying adrenal activation. Concentrations of fALD were positively correlated with fGCs in right whales (r = 0.59, P < 0.001), suggesting concurrent secretion of these hormones by the adrenal gland. However, fALD levels were less influenced by concentrations of reproductive steroids in feces, minimizing the potential confounder of assay cross-reactivity in samples with highly skewed hormone ratios. Across different life history states for right whales, fALD concentrations showed similar patterns to those reported for fGC, with higher levels in pregnant females (35.9 ± 7.6 ng/g) followed by reproductively mature males (9.5 ± 0.9 ng/g) (P < 0.05), providing further evidence of elevated adrenal activation in these groups of whales. The addition of fALD measurement as a biomarker of adrenal activation may help distinguish between intrinsic and external causes of stress hormone elevations in large whales, as well as other free-living wildlife species, providing a more comprehensive approach for associating adrenal activation with specific natural and anthropogenic stressors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aldosterone; Glucocorticoids; Mineralocorticoids; Noninvasive; Right whale; Stress hormones","aldosterone; glucocorticoid; aldosterone; biological marker; glucocorticoid; adrenal gland; adult; Article; calf (mammal); Cetacea; controlled study; Eubalaena glacialis; feces analysis; female; hormone release; juvenile; male; non invasive measurement; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; adrenal gland; animal; blood; Cetacea; chemistry; feces; metabolism; reproducibility; Adrenal Glands; Aldosterone; Animals; Biomarkers; Feces; Female; Glucocorticoids; Male; Radioimmunoassay; Reproducibility of Results; Whales",,"aldosterone, 52-39-1, 6251-69-0; Aldosterone; Biomarkers; Glucocorticoids",,,"Canadian Heritage

Homologous recombination (HR) repair is a high fidelity DNA repair pathway that utilizes a homologous DNA sequence to accurately repair such damage and protect the genome. Prolonged exposure (> 72 h) to the human lung carcinogen, particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), inhibits HR repair, resulting in increased chromosome instability in human cells. Comparative studies have shown acute Cr(VI) exposure induces less chromosome damage in whale cells than human cells, suggesting investigating the effect of this carcinogen in other species may inform efforts to prevent Cr(VI)-induced chromosome instability. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of prolonged Cr(VI) exposure on HR repair and clastogenesis in North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) lung cells. We show particulate Cr(VI) induces HR repair activity after both acute (24 h) and prolonged (120 h) exposure in North Atlantic right whale cells. Although the RAD51 response was lower following prolonged Cr(VI) exposure compared to acute exposure, the response was sufficient for HR repair to occur. In accordance with active HR repair, no increase in Cr(VI)-induced clastogenesis was observed with increased exposure time. These results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure affects HR repair and genomic stability differently in whale and human lung cells. Future investigation of the differences in how human and whale cells respond to chemical carcinogens may provide valuable insight into mechanisms of preventing chemical carcinogenesis. © 2017","Genomic instability; Hexavalent chromium; Homologous recombination repair; North Atlantic right whale lung fibroblasts; Rad51","chromic acid; chromium; unclassified drug; zinc chromate; chromic acid; particulate matter; zinc chromate; zinc derivative; animal cell; Article; Cetacea; chemical carcinogenesis; chromosomal instability; chromosome damage; cytotoxicity; Eubalaena glacialis; genomic instability; human; human cell; lung alveolus cell; nonhuman; recombination repair; sister chromatid exchange; administration and dosage; animal; cell culture; cell survival; Cetacea; cytology; dose response; drug effects; lung; particulate matter; physiology; recombination repair; respiratory mucosa; time factor; toxicity; Animals; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Chromates; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Lung; Particulate Matter; Recombinational DNA Repair; Respiratory Mucosa; Time Factors; Whales; Zinc Compounds",,"chromic acid, 11104-59-9; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; Chromates; Particulate Matter; zinc chromate; Zinc Compounds",,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: ACD FSB-2009

A total of 969 cetacean sightings of over 10,000 animals were documented during systematic line-transect aerial surveys (67,525 km flown). Twelve cetacean species were documented, including seven odontocete and five mysticete species. Cetaceans were recorded in all seasons demonstrating inter-annual, seasonal, and spatial use of the WEAs. Peak presence occurred in the spring and summer for most species, with the exception of North Atlantic right whales, which occurred primarily in the winter and spring. Right and sei whales were documented regularly throughout the study and in higher numbers than expected. Seasonal estimates of abundance were calculated for seven species, including five baleen whales (fin, minke, humpback, right, and sei) and two dolphins (common and bottlenose). The results suggest the area is a previously underestimated seasonal habitat for cetaceans including several endangered baleen whale species. These data will help inform mitigation strategies for future wind energy development. Climate change effects, increased coastal urbanization, and other factors argue for continued monitoring of cetaceans in the WEAs offshore of New England. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aerial survey; Baleen whale; Cetaceans; Distribution and abundance; New England; Toothed whale; Wind energy development","abundance; aerial survey; dolphin; population distribution; seasonal variation; whale; wind power; Massachusetts; New England; Rhode Island; United States; Animalia; Balaenoptera borealis; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti; Odontoceti",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., (1916) The whalebone whales of New England.

This paper argues that at least a 30% reduction in risk is needed to meaningfully contribute to the conservation of right whales. The argument follows from risk estimates calculated using time and space intersections of right whales and fishing gear in Canadian waters. Almost all the risk occurs during July, August and September (12%, 50%, 37% respectively) and the groundfish fishery contributed the greatest proportion (86%) of annual risk. Given that efforts in the USA to reduce entanglement risk through modified fishing gear have been unsuccessful to date, we address the alternative option of restricting certain fishing gear at times and locations where entanglement risk is elevated. There are many options that Canada could employ to achieve the above risk reduction and our results clearly point to the most effective and efficient action being seasonally restricted fishing in two relatively small regions; the Grand Manan Basin and the Roseway Basin. Fully a third (34%±4%) of the annual risk is associated with these two basins, though fishery catch estimates in the basins are relatively small and declining. © 2017","Bycatch; Canada; Entanglement; Fishing; Right whales","bycatch; fishing; fishing gear; risk factor; species conservation; whale; Canada; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: RGPIN-2014-04036

Their food primarily consists of planktonic copepods, Calanus finmarchicus, which they consume in large numbers by ram filter feeding. The coastal waters where these whales forage are turbid, but they successfully locate copepod swarms during the day at depths exceeding 100 m, where light is very dim and copepod patches may be difficult to see. Using models of E. glacialis visual sensitivity together with measurements of light in waters near Cape Cod where they feed and of light attenuation by living copepods in seawater, we evaluated the potential for visual foraging by these whales. Our results suggest that vision may be useful for finding copepod patches, particularly if E. glacialis searches overhead for silhouetted masses or layers of copepods. This should permit the whales to locate C. finmarchicus visually throughout most daylight hours at depths throughout their foraging range. Looking laterally, the whales might also be able to see copepod patches at short range near the surface. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Prescott Marine Laboratory, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA  02110, United States","Immunoassay of hormone metabolites extracted from faecal samples of free-ranging large whales can provide biologically relevant information on reproductive state and stress responses. North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis Müller 1776) are an ideal model for testing the conservation value of faecal metabolites. Almost all North Atlantic right whales are individually identified, most of the population is sighted each year, and systematic survey effort extends back to 1986. North Atlantic right whales number <500 individuals and are subject to anthropogenic mortality, morbidity and other stressors, and scientific data to inform conservation planning are recognized as important. Here, we describe the use of classification trees as an alternative method of analysing multiple-hormone data sets, building on univariate models that have previously been used to describe hormone profiles of individual North Atlantic right whales of known reproductive state. Our tree correctly classified the age class, sex and reproductive state of 83% of 112 faecal samples from known individual whales. Pregnant females, lactating females and both mature and immature males were classified reliably using our model. Non-reproductive [i.e. 'resting' (not pregnant and not lactating) and immature] females proved the most unreliable to distinguish. There were three individual males that, given their age, would traditionally be considered immature but that our tree classed as mature males, possibly calling for a re-evaluation of their reproductive status. Our analysis reiterates the importance of considering the reproductive state of whales when assessing the relationship between cortisol concentrations and stress. Overall, these results confirm findings from previous univariate statistical analyses, but with a more robust multivariate approach that may prove useful for the multiple-analyte data sets that are increasingly used by conservation physiologists. © The Author 2017.

To test the potential generalizability of this technique for studies of stress and reproduction in large whales, we sought to determine whether all major classes of steroid and thyroid hormones are detectable in baleen, and whether these hormones are detectable in other mysticetes. Powdered baleen samples were recovered from single specimens of North Atlantic right, bowhead, blue (Balaenoptera [B.] musculus), sei (B. borealis), minke (B. acutorostrata), fin (B. physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whales. Hormones were extracted with a methanol vortex method, after which we tested all species with commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs, Arbor Assays) for progesterone, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, representing a wide array of steroid and thyroid hormones of interest for whale physiology research. In total, 64 parallelism tests (8 species × 8 hormones) were evaluated to verify good binding affinity of the assay antibodies to hormones in baleen. We also tested assay accuracy, although available sample volume limited this test to progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. All tested hormones were detectable in baleen powder of all species, and all assays passed parallelism and accuracy tests. Although only single individuals were tested, the consistent detectability of all hormones in all species indicates that baleen hormone analysis is likely applicable to a broad range of mysticetes, and that the EIA kits tested here perform well with baleen extract. Quantification of hormones in baleen may be a suitable technique with which to explore questions that have historically been difficult to address in large whales, including pregnancy and inter-calving interval, age of sexual maturation, timing and duration of seasonal reproductive cycles, adrenal physiology and metabolic rate. © The Author 2017.

Entangled whales are subject to additional drag forces requiring increased thrust power and energy expenditure over time. To classify entanglement cases and aid potential disentanglement efforts, it is useful to know how long an entangled whale might survive, given the unique configurations of the gear they are towing. This study establishes an approach to predict drag forces on fishing gear that entangles whales, and applies this method to ten North Atlantic right whale cases to estimate the resulting increase in energy expenditure and the critical entanglement duration that could lead to death. Estimated gear drag ranged 11–275 N. Most entanglements were resolved before critical entanglement durations (mean ± SD 216 ± 260 days) were reached. These estimates can assist real-time development of disentanglement action plans and U.S. Federal Serious Injury assessments required for protected species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Body condition; Drag; Entanglement duration; Large whale(s); Right whale; Serious injury","Fisheries; Technology transfer; Underwater structures; Body condition; Entanglement duration; Large whale(s); Right whales; Serious injuries; Drag; action plan; anthropogenic effect; body condition; drag; fishing gear; injury; whale; Article; energy expenditure; entanglement; environmental aspects and related phenomena; fishing; longevity; nonhuman; sensitivity analysis; telemetry; animal; Cetacea; fishery; injuries; injury; mortality; swimming; veterinary; waste; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; waste; Animals; Fisheries; Swimming; Waste Products; Whales; Wounds and Injuries",,"Waste Products",,,,,,"Ahlborn, B.K., Blake, R.W., Chan, K.H.S., Optimal fineness ratio for minimum drag in large whales (2009) Can.

Weused photographs of individually identified right whales to assess visual changes in body conditionin reproductive females, adult males, juveniles, and entangled whales. Images from sightingsof individual whales were grouped sequentially by habitat region, and each group of images wasassigned a body condition score of good, fair, or poor based on the dorsal profile posterior to theblowholes. Temporally consecutive groups of images (n = 1496) of 340 individual whales werecompared to investigate the frequency, direction, and minimum timeframe between changes inbody condition. Changes in body condition scores of right whales were significantly influenced bygroup category. Lactating females and severely entangled right whales were more likely toexhibit declining body condition than other groups. Resting females were significantly more likelyto improve in condition than other groups but exhibited the longest timeframe for improving condition.Young juveniles were less likely to improve in condition compared to adult males, butremained in compromised condition less frequently than older juveniles and adult males. Theshortest timeframes between changing body condition scores were 11 d for declining conditionand 12 d for improving condition. This study demonstrates that photographic analysis can detectrapid body condition changes and identifies groups of right whales that are particularly vulnerableto declining condition and delayed recovery from energetically taxing events. © The authors 2017.","Anthropogenic injury;

Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to assess stress responses to anthropogenic factors in wildlife. While obtaining blood samples to measure circulating hormones is not currently feasible for freeswimming large whales, immunoassay of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCs) has been validated for North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARW). Using a general linear model, we compared fGC concentrations in right whales chronically entangled in fishing gear (n = 6) or live-stranded (n = 1), with right whales quickly killed by vessels (n = 5) and healthy right whales (n = 113) to characterize fGC responses to acute vs. chronic stressors. fGCs in entangled whales (mean ± SE: 1856.4 ± 1644.9 ng g-1) and the stranded whale (5740.7 ng g-1) were significantly higher than in whales killed by vessels (46.2 ± 19.2 ng g-1) and healthy whales (51.7 ± 8.7 ng g-1). Paired feces and serum collected from the live-stranded right whale provided comparison of fGCs in 2 matrices in a chronically stressed whale. Serum cortisol and corticosterone in this whale (50.0 and 29.0 ng ml-1, respectively) were much higher than values reported in other cetaceans, in concordance with extremely elevated fGCs. Meaningful patterns in fGC concentration related to acute vs. chronic impacts persisted despite potential for bacterial degradation of hormone meta - bolites in dead whales. These results provide biological validation for using fGCs as a biomarker of chronic stress in NARWs. © The author 2017.","Entanglement; Fecal hormones; Glucocorticoids; North Atlantic right whale; Stress","cetacean; environmental stress; fecal pellet; human activity; injury; mortality; steroid; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Bacteria (microorganisms); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,"Our special gratitude to the NE and SE U.S. Marine Mammal Stranding Networks, and the ne-cropsy and disentanglement teams for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of NARWs.

Prior to 2011, little systematic survey effort had been conducted in the area. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the state of Massachusetts supported 3.5 yr of twice-monthly aerial surveys by the Northeast Large Pelagic Survey Collaborative (NLPSC). Additional survey teams including the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and the Center for Coastal Studies have collected sightings data in the region. Data systematically collected by the NLPSC allowed analyses of monthly sightings rates, sightings per unit effort, and hot spots which provided information on current temporal and spatial use patterns. Abundance estimates for each season-year (i.e. a 3 mo period within a given survey year) were calculated. Behaviors observed included feeding and surface active groups. Photo-identification of whales since 2010 yielded a minimum count of 196 unique individuals (annual average = 35), or over one-third of the current population estimate. Analyses of demographics of these individuals revealed that 34 known calving females (30% of the total currently presumed alive) visited the study area. These results demonstrate consistent annual use of this area by a significant portion of the E. glacialis population, with a strong correlation between season and presence. These findings can inform management activities and development planning, and be used as a baseline dataset for assessing long-term impacts to the species. © The authors 2017.","Abundance; Behavior; Demographics; Distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic right whale; Wind energy area","abundance; behavioral ecology; endangered species; offshore structure; species occurrence; whale; wind farm; wind power; Massachusetts; Rhode Island; United States; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Bailey, H., Brookes, K.L., Thompson, P.M., Assessing environmental impacts of offshore wind farms: lessons learned and recommendations for the future (2014) Aquat Biosyst, 10, p. 8; Barlow, J., Trackline detection probability for longdiving whales (1999) Marine mammal survey and assessment methods, pp. 209-221. , In: Garner GW, Amstrup SC, Laake JL, Manly BFJ, McDonald LL, Robertson DG (ed) Balkema, Rotterdam; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Bergström, L., Kautsky, L., Malm, T., Rosenberg, R., Wahlberg, M., Capetillo, N.Å., Wilhelmsson, D., Effects of offshore wind farms on marine wildlife-a generalized impact assessment (2014) Environ Res Lett, 9; (2013) Commercial wind lease issuance and site assessment activities on the Atlantic outer continental shelf offshore Rhode Island and Massachusetts, , Revised environmental assessment, OCS EIS/EA BOEM 2013-1131.

Later, Plisnier-Ladame & Quinet (1969) added a neurocranium and other skeletal remains from the same area to this species. Recently, the neurocranium was re-assigned to the genus Eubalaena thanks to newer phylogenetic analyses. Here, a new description is provided of materials previously assigned to ""Balaena"" belgica together with taxonomic revisions. Our work suggests that the cervical complex originally designated as the type of ""Balaena"" belgica is too poorly preserved to be used as such and is assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet., thus making ""Balaena"" belgica a nomen dubium. In addition to the neurocranium, the other remains consist in a fragment of maxilla assigned to Balaenidae gen. et sp. indet. and in a humerus assigned to Eubalaena sp. Discovered in the Kruisschans Sands Member of the Lillo Formation (3.2-2.8 Ma, Piacenzian, Late Pliocene), the neurocranium is designated as the holotype of the new species Eubalaena ianitrix. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a sister-group relationship of Eubalaena ianitrix and Eubalaena glacialis, and helps constraining the ages of origin for balaenid clades. Ecological and phylogenetic data suggest that Eubalaena ianitrix may represent the direct ancestor of Eubalaena glacialis, the latter having evolved through phyletic transformation including body size increase during the temperature decline of the Late Pliocene. © 2017 Bisconti et al.","Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena ianitrix; Mysticeti; Phylogeny; Pliocene","body size; cladistics; Eubalaena; humerus; maxilla; new species; Piacenzian; sister group",,,,,,,,"Abel, O., Vorläufige Mitteilungen über die Revision der fossilen Mystacoceten aus dem Tertiär Belgiens (1941) Bulletin du Museum Royal d'Histoire Naturelles de Belgique, 24 (17), pp. 1-29; Benke, H., Investigations on the osteology and the functional morphology of the flipper of whales and dolphins (Cetacea) (1993) Investigations on Cetacea, 24, pp. 9-252; Bisconti, M., New description, character analysis and preliminary phyletic assessment of two Balaenidae skulls from the Italian Pliocene (2000) Palaeontographia Italica, 87, pp. 37-66; Bisconti, M., An early late Pliocene right whale (genus Eubalaena) from Tuscany (Central Italy) (2002) Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana, 4, pp. 83-91; Bisconti, M., Evolutionary history of Balaenidae (2003) Cranium, 20, pp. 9-50; Bisconti, M., Skull morphology and phylogenetic relationships of a new diminutive balaenid from the Lower Pliocene of Belgium (2005) Palaeontology, 48, pp. 793-816; Bisconti, M., Morphology and phylogenetic relationships of a new diminutive balaenid from the lower Pliocene of Belgium (2005) Palaeontology, 48, pp. 793-816; Bisconti, M., Paleontologia e conservazione: il caso della balena della Groenlandia (2005) La logica dell'evoluzione dei viventi-Spunti di Riflessione, pp. 133-142 and 167. , Scapini F, ed.

Entanglement in fishing gear adds significant drag and buoyant forces that can impact swimming behaviors across a range of timescales. We deployed biologging tags during the disentanglement of 2 North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis to (1) examine how their kinematics changed in response to drag and buoyancy from entanglement in fishing gear, and (2) calculate resultant changes in swimming efficiency for one individual. We observed variable responses in dive behavior, but neither whale appeared to exploit added buoyancy to reduce energy expenditure. While some of the observed changes in behavior were individually specific, some swimming kinematics were consistently modulated in response to high drag and buoyancy associated with entangling gear, affecting thrust production. In high drag and buoyancy conditions, fluke strokes were significantly shorter and more variable in shape, and gliding was less frequent. Thrust and efficiency significantly differed among dive phases. Disentanglement reduced thrust coefficients ~4-fold, leading to 1.2 to 1.8-fold lower power (W). Ideal propulsive efficiency was significantly lower when entangled, though we detected no difference in observed propulsive efficiency between the conditions. Similar to carrying heavy objects or changing shoes, we present another condition where animals perceive unique movement constraints over seconds to minutes and develop compensatory strategies, altering their movement accordingly. © The authors 2017.","Buoyancy; Compensation; Drag; DTAG; Gait change","buoyancy; drag; fishing gear; kinematics; swimming behavior; whale; Animalia; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC

Entanglement in fishing gear is one example of an unnatural but relatively common circumstance that imposes energetic demands of a similar order of magnitude and duration of life-history events such as migration and pregnancy in large whales. We present two complementary bioenergetic approaches to estimate the energy associated with entanglement in North Atlantic right whales, and compare these estimates to the natural energetic life history of individual whales. Differences in measured blubber thicknesses and estimated blubber volumes between normal and entangled, emaciated whales indicate between 7.4 × 1010 J and 1.2 × 1011 J of energy are consumed during the course to death of a lethal entanglement. Increased thrust power requirements to overcome drag forces suggest that when entangled, whales require 3.95 × 109 to 4.08 × 1010 J more energy to swim. Individuals who died from their entanglements performed significantly more work (energy expenditure × time) than those that survived; entanglement duration is therefore critical in determining whales’ survival. Significant sublethal energetic impacts also occur, especially in reproductive females. Drag from fishing gear contributes up to 8% of the 4-year female reproductive energy budget, delaying time of energetic equilibrium (to restore energy lost by a particular entanglement) for reproduction by months to years. In certain populations, chronic entanglement in fishing gear can be viewed as a costly unnatural life-history stage, rather than a rare or short-term incident. © 2016 The Authors.

Analyzing 203 references (from 1976 to 2016), we obtained a “black-list” of 101 species impacted by marine litter (78.9% on 128 species totally known). At species level, four cetacean (Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus, Tursiops truncatus, Eubalaena glacialis) showed the highest number of bibliographic citations. A significant higher number of species was impacted by entanglement when compared to ingestion. Macro-litter represents the main factor of pressure in all groups; micro-litter showed the highest frequency in Mysticeti, probably explained from their food filtration behaviour. Both intrinsic eco-biogeographic traits (e.g. trophic niche, food catching behaviour, species range) and extrinsic methodological biases could explain our patterns. Since the entanglement is easier to record because of imply only an external observation without further post-mortem examination, and that large litter is easier to detect in respect to meso- and micro-litter, we hypothesize that both this information could be largely biased. Moreover, we observed a direct correlation between the research effort on species (obtained from Scholar recurrences) and the number of citations related to marine litter events, although some exceptions are present: therefore our “black” list of impacted species is not complete and could be increased focusing research on poor-studied neglected species. After 2005 the number of studies on this topic showed a large increase: however, literature appeared extremely heterogeneous. In this sense, we suggest the use of a standardized nomenclature for pressures and impacts to reduce the loss of information. © 2017, Associazione Teriologica Italiana onlus.

On average baleen is 32.35% water by weight in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 34.37% in bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). Baleen’s wettability measured by water droplet contact angles shows that dried baleen is hydrophobic whereas hydrated baleen is highly hydrophilic. Three-point flexural bending tests of mechanical strength reveal that baleen is strong yet ductile. Dried baleen is brittle and shatters at about 20-30 Nmm− 2 but hydrated baleen is less stiff; it bends with little force and absorbed water is squeezed outwhen force is applied. Maximum recorded stress was 4× higher in dried (mean 14.29 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 3.69 N mm− 2) baleen, and the flexural stiffness was &gt;10× higher in dried (mean 633 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 58 N mm− 2) baleen. In addition to documenting hydration’s powerful effects on baleen, this study indicates that baleen is far more pliant and malleable than commonly supposed, with implications for studies of baleen’s structure and function as well as its susceptibility to oil or other hydrophobic pollutants. © 2016 The Authors.","Biomechanics; Histology; Hydrophilic; Mysticete; Stiffness; Whale",,,,,,,,,"Fitzgerald, E.M.G., A bizarre new toothed mysticete (Cetacea) from Australia and the early evolution of baleen whales (2006) Proc.

The recent discovery of rod monochromacy in some cetacean lineages provides a novel opportunity to investigate the effects of an evolutionary loss of cone photoreception on retinal organization. Sequence analysis of right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; family Balaenidae) cDNA derived from long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone opsin mRNA identified several mutations in the opsin coding sequence, suggesting the loss of cone cell function, but maintenance of non-photosensitive, cone opsin mRNA-expressing cells in the retina. Subsequently, we investigated the retina of the closely related bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus; family Balaenidae) to determine how the loss of cone-mediated photoreception affects light signaling pathways in the retina. Anti-opsin immunofluorescence demonstrated the total loss of cone opsin expression in B. mysticetus, whereas light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and bipolar cell (protein kinase C-α [PKC-α] and recoverin) immunofluorescence revealed the maintenance of cone soma, putative cone pedicles, and both rod and cone bipolar cell types. These findings represent the first immunological and anatomical evidence of a naturally occurring rod-monochromatic mammalian retina, and suggest that despite the loss of cone-mediated photoreception, the associated cone signaling structures (i.e., cone synapses and cone bipolar cells) may be maintained for multichannel rod-based signaling in balaenid whales.

It came close to extinction after nearly a millennium of exploitation and currently persists as a population of only approximately 500 individuals. Setting appropriate conservation targets for this species requires an understanding of its historical population size, as a baseline for measuring levels of depletion and progress toward recovery. This is made difficult by the scarcity of records over this species' long whaling history. We sought to estimate the preexploitation population size of the North Atlantic right whale and understand how this species was distributed across its range. We used a spatially explicit data set on historical catches of North Pacific right whales (NPRWs) (Eubalaena japonica) to model the relationship between right whale relative density and the environment during the summer feeding season. Assuming the 2 right whale species select similar environments, we projected this model to the North Atlantic to predict how the relative abundance of NARWs varied across their range. We calibrated these relative abundances with estimates of the NPRW total prewhaling population size to obtain high and low estimates for the overall NARW population size prior to exploitation. The model predicted 9,075-21,328 right whales in the North Atlantic. The current NARW population is thus <6% of the historical North Atlantic carrying capacity and has enormous potential for recovery. According to the model, in June-September NARWs concentrated in 2 main feeding areas: east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and in the Norwegian Sea.

Whales enhance phytoplankton nutrition by releasing fecal plumes near the surface after feeding and by migrating from highly productive, high-latitude feeding areas to low-latitude nutrient-poor calving areas. In this study, we measured NH4 + and PO4 3- release rates from the feces of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a highly endangered baleen whale. Samples for this species were primarily collected by locating aggregations of whales in surface- Active groups (SAGs), which typically consist of a central female surrounded by males competing for sexual activity. When freshly collected feces were incubated in seawater, high initial rates of N release were generally observed, which decreased to near zero within 24 hours of sampling, a pattern that is consistent with the active role of gut microflora on fecal particles. We estimate that at least 10% of particulate N in whale feces becomes available as NH4 + within 24 hours of defecation. Phosphorous was also abundant in fecal samples: Initial release rates of PO4 3- were higher than for NH4 +, yielding low N/P nutrient ratios over the course of our experiments. The rate of PO4 3- release was thus more than sufficient to preclude the possibility that nitrogenous nutrients supplied by whales would lead to phytoplankton production limited by P availability. Phytoplankton growth experiments indicated that NH4 + released from whale feces enhance productivity, as would be expected, with no evidence that fecal metabolites suppress growth. Although North Atlantic right whales are currently rare (approximately 450 individuals), they once numbered about 14,000 and likely played a substantial role in recycling nutrients in areas where they gathered to feed and mate. Even though the NH4 + released from fresh whale fecal material is a small fraction of total whale fecal nitrogen, and recognizing the fact that the additional nitrogen released in whale urine would be difficult to measure in a field study, the results of this study support the idea that the distinctive isotopic signature of the released NH4 + could be used to provide a conservative estimate of the contribution of the whale pump to primary productivity in coastal regions where whales congregate. © 2016 Roman et al.

Entanglement can lead to direct injury and is likely to incur substantial energetic costs. This study (1) evaluates drag characteristics of entangled right whales, (2) contextualizes gear drag measurements for individual whales, and (3) quantifies the benefits of partial disentanglement. A load cell measured drag forces on 15 sets of fishing gear removed from entangled right whales, a towed satellite telemetry buoy, and 200 m of polypropylene line as it was shortened to 25 m, as they were towed behind a vessel at ~0.77, 1.3, and 2.1 m/s (~1.5, 2.5, and 4 knots) and ~0, 3, and 6 m depth. Mean drag ranges from 8.5 N to 315 N, and can be predicted from the dry weight or length of the gear. Combining gear drag measurements with theoretical estimates of drag on whales' bodies suggests that on average, entanglement increases drag and propulsive power by 1.47 fold. Reducing trailing line length by 75% can reduce parasitic gear drag by 85%, reinforcing current disentanglement response practices. These drag measurements can be incorporated into disentanglement response, serious injury determination, and evaluation of sublethal effects on population dynamics. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Drag coefficient; Energetics; Fisheries; Line; Rope; Thrust; Whale","aquaculture method; bioenergetics; biotelemetry; drag; fishery; fishing gear; fishing vessel; injury; thrust; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Ahlborn, B.K., Blake, R.W., Chan, K.H.S., Optimal fineness ratio for minimum drag in large whales (2009) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 87, pp. 124-131; Archie, E.A., Wound healing in the wild: Stress, sociality, and energetic costs affect wound healing in natural populations (2013) Parasite Immunology, 35, pp. 374-385; Arthur, L.H., Mclellan, W.A., Piscitelli, M.A., Estimating maximal force output of cetaceans using axial locomotor muscle morphology (2015) Marine Mammal Science; Baldwin, K., Pickett, T., (2009) The time tension line cutter evaluation: Fishermen pilot study and controlled experiments, p. 101. , http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/whaletrp/trt/meetings/Mid-Atlantic_Southeast_ALWTRT_Materials/UNH, Final report for NOAA Contract NA08NMF4270419.

In the United States, deaths of North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have exceeded management limits for decades. We examined live and dead whales entangled in fishing gear along the U.S. East Coast and the Canadian Maritimes from 1994 to 2010. We recorded whale species, age, and injury severity and determined rope polymer type, breaking strength, and diameter of the fishing gear. For the 132 retrieved ropes from 70 cases, tested breaking strength range was 0.80-39.63 kN (kiloNewtons) and the mean was 11.64 kN (SD 8.29), which is 26% lower than strength at manufacture (range 2.89-53.38 kN, mean = 15.70 kN [9.89]). Median rope diameter was 9.5 mm. Right and humpback whales were found in ropes with significantly stronger breaking strengths at time of manufacture than minke whales (Balaenoptera acuturostrata) (19.30, 17.13, and 10.47 mean kN, respectively). Adult right whales were found in stronger ropes (mean 34.09 kN) than juvenile right whales (mean 15.33 kN) and than all humpback whale age classes (mean 17.37 kN). For right whales, severity of injuries increased since the mid 1980s, possibly due to changes in rope manufacturing in the mid 1990s that resulted in production of stronger ropes at the same diameter. Our results suggest that broad adoption of ropes with breaking strengths of ≤7.56 kN (≤1700 lbsf) could reduce the number of life-threatening entanglements for large whales by at least 72%, and yet could provide sufficient strength to withstand the routine forces involved in many fishing operations. A reduction of this magnitude would achieve nearly all the mitigation legally required for U.S. stocks of North Atlantic right and humpback whales. Ropes with reduced breaking strength should be developed and tested to determine the feasibility of their use in a variety of fisheries. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.","Bycatch; Humpback whales; Injury severity; North Atlantic right whales; Rope diameter; Rope manufacturing","age class; bycatch; fishing gear; injury; juvenile; management practice; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; animal; animal behavior; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Cetacea; fishery; physiology; United States; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Behavior, Animal; Canada; Fisheries; United States; Whales",,,,,,,,"Arthur, L.H., McLellan, W.A., Piscitelli, M.A., Rommel, S.A., Woodward, B.L., Winn, J.P., Potter, C.W., Pabst, D.A., Estimating maximal force output of cetaceans using axial locomotor muscle morphology (2015) Marine Mammal Science, 31, pp. 1401-1426; Cassoff, R.M., Moore, K.M., McLellan, W.A., Barco, S.G., Rotstein, D.S., Moore, M.J., Lethal entanglement in baleen whales (2011) Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 96, pp. 175-185; Administer a consortium for fisheries and wildlife resolution (2007), Final contract report.

Primarily viewed as a migratory corridor between northern feeding and mating areas and the southern calving area, Virginia waters have not been intensely monitored for right whales. We conducted a 1 yr, continuous, passive acoustic survey from the Virginia coast to the continental shelf to better describe the seasonal occurrence and spatial distribution of right whales in this area. We found that whales were acoustically detected in every month of the year, with increased seasonal occurrences in fall and late winter/early spring, and not just during limited periods of the year. As industry activities continue to increase in the area, these new right whale occurrence data have implications for siting and permitting of offshore energy activities. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Eubalaena glacialis; Bioacoustics; Mid-Atlantic; Passive acoustic monitoring; Right whale; Seasonality; Virginia","acoustic survey; bioacoustics; continental shelf; endangered species; energy market; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatial distribution; species occurrence; whale; United States; Virginia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Ambler, J.B., Whales and the people who watch them: Baleen whales in Virginia's near-shore waters and the educational and conservation potential of whale watching (2011), p. 175. , Ph.D. dissertation, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 62, pp. 527-543; Baumgartner, M.F., Fratantoni, D.M., Hurst, T.P., Brown, M.W., Cole, T.V.N., Van Parijs, S.M., Johnson, M., Real-time reporting of baleen whale passive acoustic detections from ocean gliders (2013) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134, pp. 1814-1823; XBAT R6: eXtensible BioAcoustics Tool.

The effect of these factors on individual health is unclear. A statistical model using photographic evidence of health was recently built to infer the true or hidden health of individual right whales. However, two important prior assumptions about the role of missing data and unexplained variance on the estimates were not previously assessed. Here we tested these factors by varying prior assumptions and model formulation.

While call detection provides information on species presence, additional information may be contained within the vocalizations that could provide more information regarding the demographics and/or number of individuals in a particular area based on passive acoustic detections. The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis produces a stereotyped upswept call, termed the upcall, that is thought to function as a long-distance contact call in this species. As such, the call is likely to contain cues providing information about the individual producing it. The goal of this study was to test whether the right whale upcall could potentially encode information related to the identity and age of the caller. Using upcalls recorded from 14 known individuals through non-invasive suction cup archival acoustic tags, we demonstrate that the upcall does contain sufficient information to discriminate individual identity and age class, with average classification levels of 72.6 and 86.1%, respectively. Parameters measured from the fundamental frequency, duration, and formant structure were most important for discrimination among individuals. This study is the first step in demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining additional data from passive acoustic monitoring to aid in the conservation efforts for this highly endangered species. ï¿½ The authors 2016.","Acoustic communication; Formants; Individual recognition; Passive acoustic monitoring; Right whale; Vocal signature","bioacoustics; conservation planning; endangered species; species conservation; vocalization; whale; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Antunes, R., Schulz, T., Gero, S., Whitehead, H., Gordon, J., Rendell, L., Individually distinctive acoustic features in sperm whale codas (2011) Anim Behav, 81, pp. 723-730; Au, W.W.L., Hastings, M.C., (2010) Principles of marine bio-acoustics, , Springer, New York, NY; Aubin, T., Jouventin, P., Hildebrand, C., Penguins use the two-voice system to recognize each other (2000) Proc R Soc B, 267, pp. 1081-1087; Bachorowski, J.A., Owren, M.J., Acoustic correlates of talker sex and individual talker identity are present in a short vowel segment produced in running speech (1999) J Acoust Soc Am, 106, pp. 1054-1063; Bee, M.A., Kozich, C.E., Blackwell, K.J., Gerhardt, H.C., Individual variation in advertisement calls of territorial male green frogs, Rana clamitans: implications for individual discrimination (2001) Ethology, 107, pp. 65-84; Blumstein, D.T., Munos, O., Individual, age and sexspecific information is contained in yellow-bellied marmot alarm calls (2005) Anim Behav, 69, pp. 353-361; Blumstein, D.T., Mennill, D.J., Clemins, P., Girod, L., Acoustic monitoring in terrestrial environments using microphone arrays: applications, technological considerations and prospectus (2011) J Appl Ecol, 48, pp. 758-767; Boersma, P., Weenink, D., (2012) Praat: doing phonetics by computer, , http://www.praat.org/, Version 5.3.17 (acces-sed 15 October 2015); Bort, J., Van Parijs, S.M., Stevick, P.T., Summers, E., Todd, S., North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis vocalization patterns in the central Gulf of Maine from October 2009 through October 2010 (2015) Endang Species Res, 26, pp. 271-280; Boughman, J.W., Greater spear-nosed bats give groupdistinctive calls (1997) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 40, pp. 61-70; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Gaskin, D.E., White, B.N., Sexual composition and analysis of reproductive females in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, population (1994) Mar Mamm Sci, 10, pp. 253-265; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Slay, C.K., Garrison, L.P., Surveying for discovery, science, and management (2007) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, pp. 105-137. , Kraus SD, Rolland RM (eds) Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Burgess, W.C., The Acousonde: a miniature auto-nomous wideband recorder (2009) J Acoust Soc Am, 125, p. 2588; Caldwell, M.C., Caldwell, D.K., Individualized whistle contours in bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) (1965) Nature, 207, pp. 434-435; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Cazau, D., Adam, O., Laitman, J.T., Reidenberg, J.S., Understanding the intentional acoustic behavior of hump back whales: a production-based approach (2013) J Acoust Soc Am, 134, pp. 2268-2273; Charlton, B.D., Zhihe, Z., Snyder, R.J., The information content of giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, bleats: acoustic cues to sex, age and size (2009) Anim Behav, 78, pp. 893-898; Charrier, I., Harcourt, R.G., Individual vocal identity in mother and pup Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) (2006) J Mammal, 87, pp. 929-938; Charrier, I., Mathevon, N., Jouventin, P., How does a fur seal mother recognize the voice of her pup?

Prescott Marine Laboratory, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA  02110, United States","Marine mammals are faced with increasing challenges from environmental fluctuation, climate change, and disturbances from human activities. Anthropogenic mortalities have been well documented, but it is difficult to assess the sub-lethal effects of disturbance on the fitness of marine wildlife, and to distinguish these impacts from natural variations in health and reproduction. Here, we used photographic data on body and skin condition, blowhole cyamids, and rake marks, to evaluate the health of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis from 1980 to 2008. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to these data to estimate the underlying continuous health status of individuals, demographic groups, and the population to characterize health patterns and temporal trends. Visual health scores (scaled from 0 to 100) from 48560 sighting events were used to estimate the health of 622 identified right whales on a monthly basis. Health in most whales fluctuated between 70 and 90, and health scores of <60 were observed in whales in poor condition. Health varied by sex, age-class and reproductive state, with the greatest annual variability occurring in actively reproducing females. Calving females had significantly higher health scores than non-calving females, and a steep deterioration in population health coincided with a dramatic decline in calving from 1998 to 2000.

Although protected since 1935, their abundance has remained low. Right whales occupy the Atlantic Ocean from southern Greenland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence south to Florida. The highly industrialized mid-Atlantic region is part of the right whales' migratory corridor, and gaps in knowledge of their movements through this region have limited the ability to make informed decisions about management of the species. To help fill these gaps, we elicited estimates of the relative abundance of adult right whales in the mid-Atlantic during 4 months (each month representing each season) from 10 experts on right whale ecology and management. We elicited the minimum, maximum, and mode as the number of individuals in a hypothetical population of 100 right whales, and confidence estimates as percentages. For each month-sex combination, we merged the 10 experts' answers into 1 distribution. The estimated modes of relative abundances of both sexes were highest in January and April (females: 29 and 59; males: 22 and 23) and lowest in July and October (females: 5 and 9; males: 3 and 5). In some cases, our elicitation results were consistent with the results of studies based on sightings data. However, these studies generally did not adjust for sampling effort, which was low and likely variable. Our results supplement the results of these studies and will increase the accuracy of priors in complementary Bayesian models of right whale abundances and movements through the mid-Atlantic.","Merged distributions; Migratory corridor; Survival; Triangular distributions; Weighting estimates","abundance; accuracy assessment; migratory behavior; relative abundance; seasonal variation; survival; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Notice of Availability (NOA) of and request for comments on the draft proposed outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 (DPP) (2015) Fed Regist, 80, pp. 4931-4945; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell, R.L., Jr., Baleen whales: conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Rev, 29, pp. 35-60; Clark, J.S., Why environmental scientists are becoming Bayesians (2005) Ecol Lett, 8, pp. 2-14; Clark, J.S., (2007) Models for ecological data: an introduction, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Clark, J.S., Bjønstad, O.N., Population time series: process variability, observation errors, missing values, lags, and hidden states (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 3140-3150; Clark, J.S., Ferraz, G., Oguge, N., Hays, H., DiConstanzo, J., Hierarchical Bayes for structured, variable populations: from recapture data to life-history prediction (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2232-2244; Delbecq, A., Van de Ven, A., Gustafson, D., (1975) Group techniques for program planning: a guide to nominal group and Delphi processes, , Scott, Foresman & Company, Glenview, IL; Donlan, C.J., Wingfield, D.K., Crowder, L.B., Wilcox, C., Using expert opinion surveys to rank threats to endangered species: a case study with sea turtles (2010) Conserv Biol, 24, pp. 1586-1595; Donovan, C., Harwood, J., King, S., Booth, C., Caneco, B., Walker, C., Expert elicitation methods in quantifying the consequences of acoustic disturbance from offshore renewable energy developments Advances in experimental medicine and biology, 875. , (in press)Popper AN, Hawkins AD (eds): the effects of noise on aquatic life II.

Baleen whale communication may be particularly vulnerable to shipping noise impacts due to overlap in the frequencies of signals and noise. Baleen whales rely upon acoustic signals to mediate a variety of social interactions when separated beyond visual range. We investigated the potential for noise to interfere with critical reunion events between mother-calf pairs of Endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, and whether vocal compensation can improve or maintain communication space between the sender and receiver. This information is necessary to inform future conservation efforts. We used acoustic propagation modeling to predict the transmission loss of the primary tonal communication signal used during mother-calf communication, the 'upcall', to (1) estimate over what ranges a receiving whale can detect a signal in anthropogenic noise, and (2) determine the effects of vocal compensation on detection range. Our results indicate that both point-source noise from nearby container ships and increased background noise from distant shipping may significantly limit communication space. Additionally, we show how amplitude and frequency compensation can increase the likelihood of detecting communication signals in masking noise under present conditions. We discuss these impacts of ship noise on communication, as well as the evidence that documented noise compensation behaviors of right whales can improve communication range in the presence of low-frequency ship noise. © The authors 2016.","Acoustic propagation modeling; Anthropogenic noise; Communication range; Eubalaena glacialis; Mother-calf pair; Vocal compensation","acoustics; anthropogenic effect; communication behavior; container ship; modeling; noise; shipping; vocalization; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,"Pennsylvania State University, PSU

We hypothesized that baleen plates (keratinous strips that grow downward from the palate of mysticete whales) might record previous pregnancies, in the form of high-progesterone regions in the sections of baleen that grew while the whale was pregnant. To test this hypothesis, longitudinal baleen progesterone profiles from two adult female North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) that died as a result of ship strike were compared with dates of known pregnancies inferred from calf sightings and post-mortem data. We sampled a full-length baleen plate from each female at 4 cm intervals from base (newest baleen) to tip (oldest baleen), each interval representing ~60 days of baleen growth, with high-progesterone areas then sampled at 2 or 1 cm intervals. Pulverized baleen powder was assayed for progesterone using enzyme immunoassay. The date of growth of each sampling location on the baleen plate was estimated based on the distance from the base of the plate and baleen growth rates derived from annual cycles of stable isotope ratios. Baleen progesterone profiles from both whales showed dramatic elevations (two orders of magnitude higher than baseline) in areas corresponding to known pregnancies. Baleen hormone analysis shows great potential for estimation of recent reproductive history, inter-calving interval and general reproductive biology in this species and, possibly, in other mysticete whales. © The Author 2016.","Baleen; Cetacea; Marine mammals; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Reproduction",,,,,,,,,"Ashley, N., Barboza, P., Macbeth, B., Janz, D., Cattet, M., Booth, R., Wasser, S., Glucocorticosteroid concentrations in feces and hair of captive caribou and reindeer following adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge (2011) Gen Comp Endocrinol, 172, pp. 382-391; Bechshøft, T.Ø., Sonne, C., Dietz, R., Born, E., Novak, M.A., Henchey, E., Meyer, J.S., Cortisol levels in hair of East Greenland polar bears (2011) Sci Total Environ, 15, pp. 831-834; Bechshøft, T.Ø., Rigét, F., Sonne, C., Letcher, R., Muir, D., Novak, M., Henchey, E., Jaspers, V., Measuring environmental stress in East Greenland polar bears, 1892-1927 and 1988-2009: what does hair cortisol tell us?

In this paper we report findings of an online survey designed to solicit the views of maritime industries about a long-standing endangered large whale conservation program: the Mandatory Ship Reporting (MSR) system. The MSR was established in 1999 to aid in reducing the threat of vessel collisions with the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis. Under MSR provisions, vessels >300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination when entering two key right whale aggregation areas. In return, reporting ships are sent an automated message about right whale vulnerability to ship collisions. The survey was intended to obtain views about the extent to which vessel operations were interrupted by opinthe reporting requirement; how mariners utilize, if at all, information provided in the return message; whether vessel operations were modified in response to guidance provided; and the overall importance and effectiveness of the reporting systems in helping ships avoid right whale interactions. A total of 119 mariners with broad representation of vessel types and decades of experience at sea took part in the survey; 56 of these indicated they had entered one of the MSR areas at least once. Most (ca. 70%) indicated that they comply with the reporting requirement, distribute information on right whales and ship strikes to crew members, that they were more alert about avoiding/watching for right whales, and that the ships operation may change to avoid an interaction. Of the survey-takers who had entered the system, about half indicated the MSR system is useful for educat educating captains and crew about right whales and important for right whale conservation, but only about a quarter indicated that it is useful in helping ships avoid right whales. About 40% said it is an unnecessary requirement for ships. We conclude that as an outreach tool and a means to provide information directly to domestic and international mariners entering right whale habitat for over 15 years (thus, tens of thousands of ships entering these waters have received the message), the MSR almost certainly has been beneficial in educating mariners about the issue of ship strike and in providing guidance on avoiding ship strikes. Views refl ected in the survey suggest that, at least from the mariners' perspective, the MSR program has provided positive conservation value; however, not all mariners took specific strike avoidance action after having received the message.",,"attitudinal survey; collision; conservation management; endangered species; environmental protection; environmental values; habitat structure; marine resource; maritime trade; operations technology; project management; public attitude; spatial analysis; species conservation; survey design; vessel; vulnerability; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Research and Development Center, U.S. Coast Guard

Due to quota overages and concerns about entanglement of federally protected North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, the commercial harvest of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata using pot gear has been prohibited in the southeastern United States in winter since 2009. Following the rebuilding of the Black Sea Bass stock and a change to the start date of the fishing year, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) increased the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) and is considering twelve alternatives to the pot gear closure that would revise the timing and/or spatial extent of the closure. Changes to this closure could affect the annual catch of Black Sea Bass and increase the risk of right whale entanglement in pot gear. Using historical fishing effort, landings, and right whale sightings data, we projected Black Sea Bass landings and the relative risk of right whale entanglement for each closure alternative, expressed in relative risk units (RRU). We predict that the ACL would be caught, resulting in an in-season closure for most of the proposed SAFMC closure alternatives. The relative risk of entanglement, estimated from the spatial and temporal overlap of Black Sea Bass pot gear fishing effort and right whale relative abundance, was lower for some alternatives than for others, and the relative differences between alternatives were consistent among uncertainty scenarios. The SAFMC’s preferred alternative is projected to result in a relatively low increase in risk to North Atlantic right whales (3–15 RRU off North Carolina and 1–12 RRU off Florida–South Carolina). This framework demonstrates the use of temporally dynamic spatial overlays in assessing the impacts of time–area closures with multiple objectives. © Nicholas A. Farmer, Timothy A. Gowan, Jessica R.

We present a quantitative framework for investigating the risk of deadly collisions between boats and wildlife. We apply encounter rate theory to demonstrate how marine mammal-boat encounter rate can be used to predict the expected number of deaths associated with management scenarios. We illustrate our approach with management scenarios for two endangered species: the Florida manatee Trichechus manatus latirostris and the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. We used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to demonstrate the uncertainty that is associated with our estimate of relative mortality. We show that encounter rate increased with vessel speed but that the expected number of encounters varies depending on the boating activities considered. For instance, in a scenario involving manatees and boating activities such as water skiing, the expected number of encounters in a given area (in a fixed time interval) increased with vessel speed. In another scenario in which a vessel made a transit of fixed length, the expected number of encounters decreases slightly with boat speed. In both cases, the expected number of encounters increased with distanced travelled by the boat. For whales, we found a slight reduction (0·1%) in the number of encounters under a scenario where speed is unregulated; this reduction, however, is negligible, and overall expected relative mortality was ~30% lower under the scenario with speed regulation. The probability of avoidance by the animal or vessel was set to 0 because of lack of data, but we explored the importance of this parameter on the model predictions. In fact, expected relative mortality under speed regulations decreases even further when the probability of avoidance is a decreasing function of vessel speed. By applying encounter rate theory to the case of boat collisions with marine mammals, we gained new insights about encounter processes between wildlife and watercraft. Our work emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainty when estimating wildlife mortality. Finally, our findings are relevant to other systems and ecological processes involving the encounter between moving agents. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Animal movement; Effectiveness of speed zones; Encounter rate; Florida manatee; Marine mammals; North Atlantic right whale; Protection zones; Speed zones; Wildlife collision",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.J., Gurarie, E., Zabel, R.W., Mean free-path length theory of predator-prey interactions: application to juvenile salmon migration (2005) Ecological Modelling, 186, pp. 196-211; Bauduin, S., Martin, J., Edwards, H.H., Gimenez, O., Koslovsky, S.M., Fagan, D.E., An index of risk of co-occurrence between marine mammals and watercraft: example of the Florida manatee (2013) Biological Conservation, 159, pp. 127-136; Calleson, C.S., Frohlich, K.R., Slower boat speeds reduce risks to manatees (2007) Endangered Species Research, 3, pp. 295-304; Clyde, H., Kennedy, J., A Simulation of Interactions Between the Critically Endangered North Atlantic Right Whale Eubalaena glacialis and Shipping using Dynamically Variable Temporal Granularity to Minimise Run Time (2001) MODSIM 2001 International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, pp. 813-818; Conn, P.B., Silber, G.K., Vessel speed restrictions reduce risk of collision-related mortality for North Atlantic right whales (2013) Ecosphere, 4, pp. 1-15; Evans, G.T., The encounter speed of moving predator and prey (1989) Journal of Plankton Research, 11, pp. 415-417; Fortune, S.M.E., Trites, A.W., Perryman, W.L., Moore, M.J., Pettis, M., Lynn, M.S., Growth and rapid early development of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (2012) Journal of Mammalogy, 93, pp. 1342-1354; Galos, L., Argyrakis, P., Kehr, K., Trapping and survival probability in two dimensions (2001) Physical Review, 63, pp. 1-5; Gende, S.M., Hendrix, A.N., Harris, K.R., Eichenlaub, B., Nielsen, J., Pyare, S., A Bayesian approach for understanding the role of ship speed in whale - ship encounters (2011) Ecological Applications, 21, pp. 2232-2240; Gerritsen, J., Strickler, J.R., Encounter probabilities and community structure in zooplankton: a mathematical model (1977) Journal of Fisheries Research Board Canada, 34, pp. 73-82; Gurarie, E., Ovaskainen, O., Towards a general formalization of encounter rates in ecology (2013) Theoretical Ecology, 6, pp. 189-202; Gurarie, E., Ovaskainen, O., Characteristic spatial and temporal scales unify models of animal movement (2013) American Naturalist, 178, pp. 113-123; Hain, J., Ellis, S., Kenney, R., Slay, C., Sightability of right whales in coastal waters of the southeastern United States with implications for the aerial monitoring program (1999) Marine Mammal Survey and Assessment Methods, pp. 191-207. , (eds G.

The North Atlantic right whale is an endangered species numbering just over 500 individuals. Entanglement in fishing gear is one documented source of injury and mortality, but population-level effects have been difficult to quantify. We used documented entanglements, long-term population studies and mark-recapture statistical techniques to evaluate the effect of these events on North Atlantic right whale survival. Estimates were based on 50 individuals observed carrying entangling gear between 1995 and 2008, and compared to 459 others that were never observed with gear during the same period. Entangled adults had low initial apparent survival (0.749, 95% CI: 0.601-0.855), but those that survived the first year achieved a survival rate (0.952, 95% CI: 0.907-0.977) that was more comparable to unaffected adult females (0.961, 95% CI: 0.941-0.974) and males (0.986, 95% CI: 0.975-0.993). Juveniles had a post-entanglement survival rate that was comparable to the initial survival of entangled adults (0.733, 95% CI: 0.532-0.869) and lower than un-impacted juveniles (0.978, 95% CI: 0.969-0.985). Of three entanglement characteristics examined, health impacts were most predictive of subsequent survival, but the entanglement configuration and the resulting injuries also appeared to affect outcome. When the entanglement configuration was assessed as high risk, human intervention (disentanglement) improved the survival outcome. This is the first mark-recapture estimate of entanglement survival for any whale species. The results indicate the need for continued mitigation efforts for this species, as well as for a better understanding of entanglement impacts in other baleen whale populations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","By-catch; Endangered species; Fisheries interactions; Mark-recapture; North America","aquatic organism; assessment method; bycatch; catch composition; endangered species; fishery management; fishing gear; fishing mortality; human activity; injury; juvenile; mark-recapture method; population structure; survival; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, WHOI","The authors thank the many individuals and institutions that comprise the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, the Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network, and the Northeast and Southeast Marine Mammal Stranding Networks for collecting data on NARW life histories and entanglements.

Although in late summer these habitats regularly contain thick aggregations of right whale food - the copepod Calanus spp. - right whales periodically abandon one or both habitats in the same year. The causes of abandonments, their relationship to food supply, and the locations of whales during abandonment periods are unclear. The goals of this study were to explain variation in right whale abundance indices from a habitat perspective, and to determine whether or not oceanographic variation in the habitats influences occupancy. Four indices of whale abundance and habitat occupancy, including sightings per unit effort (SPUE), photographic sightings of known individuals, population size and habitat transition probabilities, were analyzed in relation to unique datasets of Calanus concentration and water mass characteristics in each basin over the period 1987 through 2009. Calanus concentration, water mass sources and various hydrographic properties each varied coherently between basins. Calanus concentration showed an increasing trend over time in each habitat, although a short-lived reduction in Calanus may have caused right whales to abandon Roseway Basin during the mid-1990s. Food supply explained variation in right whale sightings and population size in Roseway Basin, but not in Grand Manan Basin, suggesting that the Grand Manan Basin has important habitat characteristics in addition to food supply. Changes in the distribution of whale abundance indices during years when oceanographic conditions were associated with reduced food supply in the Scotia-Fundy region suggest that other suitable feeding habitats may not have existed during such years and resulted in negative effects on whale health and reproduction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Calanus finmarchicus; Critical habitat; Eubalaena glacialis; Grand Manan Basin; Hydrography; North Atlantic right whale; Roseway Basin; Transition probabilities",,,,,,"Environment Canada

Previous studies have suggested that the reproductive rate is tightly coupled to the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), which has been shown to respond to ecosystem regime shifts associated with decadal-scale climate forcing from the Arctic. Given the endangered status of the right whale population, it is vital to determine how climate-associated changes in prey availability will affect this species in the future. Here, we investigate a 3-state reproduction model that explores multiple environmental proxies as potential predictors of annual calf production during the period from 980 to 2007. The model achieves its best fit to observations using temporally and spatially resolved C. finmarchicus abundance data derived from Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) surveys of the GOM. Building on previous research, this prey-dependent model, which uses bimonthly and geographically specific abundance anomalies of C. finmarchicus, significantly improves estimates of annual calf production relative to a null model. The temporal and geographic distributions of prey objectively chosen for inclusion in the new version of the model correspond well with observed right whale seasonal distribution patterns, providing further evidence that the model captures essential features of right whale reproductive ecology. © Inter-Research 2015.","Cetacean; Climate change; Demographic model; Reproduction; Right whale","abundance; climate change; climate forcing; demographic method; endangered species; geographical distribution; prey availability; reproductive biology; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Maine; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","Acknowledgements.

An extensive literature search reviewed the current state of knowledge on the effects of marine debris on marine organisms. 340 original publications reported encounters between organisms and marine debris and 693 species. Plastic debris accounted for 92% of encounters between debris and individuals. Numerous direct and indirect consequences were recorded, with the potential for sublethal effects of ingestion an area of considerable uncertainty and concern. Comparison to the IUCN Red List highlighted that at least 17% of species affected by entanglement and ingestion were listed as threatened or near threatened.

Instead of hearing through the ear canal, cetaceans hear through specialized fatty tissues leading to an evolutionarily novel feature: an acoustic funnel located anterior to the tympanic aperture. We traced the ontogenetic development of this feature in 56 fetal specimens from 10 different families of toothed (odontocete) and baleen (mysticete) whales, using X-ray computed tomography. We also charted ear ossification patterns through ontogeny to understand the impact of heterochronic developmental processes. We determined that the acoustic funnel arises from a prominent V-shaped structure established early in ontogeny, formed by the malleus and the goniale. In odontocetes, this V-formation develops into a cone-shaped funnel facing anteriorly, directly into intramandibular acoustic fats, which is likely functionally linked to the anterior orientation of sound reception in echolocation. In contrast, the acoustic funnel in balaenopterids rotates laterally, later in fetal development, consistent with a lateral sound reception pathway. Balaenids and several fossil mysticetes retain a somewhat anteriorly oriented acoustic funnel in the mature condition, indicating that a lateral sound reception pathway in balaenopterids may be a recent evolutionary innovation linked to specialized feeding modes, such as lunge-feeding.",,"acoustic funnel;

However, these surveys were limited by bad weather and light. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the long-term persistence of right whales in this area throughout a nearly continuous period from October 2009 through October 2010. Three archival marine acoustic recording units were deployed in the Outer Fall/central Gulf of Maine. The data were manually reviewed for right whale up-calls and gunshots to investigate seasonal and diel patterns. Up-calls and gunshots occurred seasonally, with the most calls recorded from October through January and fewer calls detected from February through July, increasing again in August through October. Up-calls were most frequent in November, and gunshots in December. There was a clear bimodal diel pattern in up-calls, with the majority of calls occurring between 04:00 through 08:00 h and 13:00 through 22:00 h. There was a clear peak in diel distribution of gunshots, with the majority of calls occurring between 16:00 and 22:00 h. Our data demonstrate the continuous presence of right whales in the central Gulf of Maine during the winter months. The rate of gunshots during winter months in Outer Fall supports the hypothesis that male advertisement and/or right whale mating behavior may be taking place in this region at that time. © Bort, Stevick, Summers and Todd 2015.","Diel variation; Gulf of maine; Mating ground; Passive acoustic monitoring; Right whale; Seasonality","acoustic method; diel variation; mating behavior; monitoring; seasonality; vocalization; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: NA09NMF4520418

Previously widespread in the North Atlantic, after centuries of hunting, these whales survive as a small population off eastern North America. Because their exploitation began before formal records started, information about their historical distribution is fragmentary. Location: North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. Methods: We linked historical records of North Pacific right whales (E. japonica; from 19th-century American whaling logbooks) with oceanographic data to generate a species distribution model. Assuming that the two species have similar environmental preferences, the model was projected into the North Atlantic to predict environmental suitability for NARWs. The reliability of these predictions was assessed by comparing the model results with historical and recent records in the North Atlantic. Results: The model predicts suitable environmental conditions over a wide, mostly offshore band across the North Atlantic. Predictions are well supported by historical and recent records, but discrepancies in some areas indicate lower discriminative ability in coastal, shallow-depth areas, suggesting that this model mainly describes the summer offshore distribution of right whales. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the summer range of the NARW consisted of a relatively narrow band (width c. 10° in latitude), extending from the eastern coast of North America to northern Norway, over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, south of Greenland and Iceland, north of the British Isles and in the Norwegian Sea. These results highlight possibilities for additional research both on the history of exploitation and on the current summer distribution of this species. In particular, better survey coverage of historical whaling grounds could help inform conservation efforts for this endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates the challenges and opportunities in using historical data to understand the original distribution of highly depleted species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Eubalaena; Boosted regression trees; Historical distribution; Right whale; Species distribution models; Whaling","endangered species; feeding ground; historical record; hypothesis testing; population distribution; prediction; reliability analysis; summer; whale; whaling; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Greenland; Iceland; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Norway; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Japonica",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 191-199; Allen, J.A., The North Atlantic right whale and its near allies.

Prescott Marine Laboratory, Research Department, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA  02110, United States","The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (NARW), a critically endangered species that has been under intensive study for nearly four decades, provides an excellent case study for applying modern methods of conservation physiology to large whales. By combining long-term sighting histories of known individuals with physiological data from newer techniques (e.g., body condition estimated from photographs; endocrine status derived from fecal samples), physiological state and levels of stress can be estimated despite the lack of any method for nonlethal capture of large whales. Since traditional techniques for validating blood assays cannot be used in large whales, assays of fecal hormones have been validated using information on age, sex, and reproductive state derived from an extensive NARW photo-identification catalog. Using this approach, fecal glucocorticoids have been found to vary dramatically with reproductive state. It is therefore essential that glucocorticoid data be interpreted in conjunction with reproductive data. A case study correlating glucocorticoids with chronic noise is presented as an example. Keys to a successful research program for this uncatchable species have included: consistent population monitoring over decades, data-sharing across institutions, an extensive photo-identification catalog that documents individual histories, and consistent efforts at noninvasive collection of samples over years. Future research will require flexibility to adjust to changing distributions of populations. © The Author 2015.

The first yearround systematic surveys were conducted to determine the spatial/temporal distribution and estimate the abundance of marine mammals in this region prior to wind power development. Eight marine mammal species were observed: North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). Results indicate clear seasonal patterns in distribution and abundance. The fin whale, humpback whale and bottlenose dolphin were sighted during all seasons. The abundance of large whales in the study area was relatively low while the abundance of dolphin and porpoise species was high and largely seasonal. The bottlenose dolphin was the most abundant species; however, abundance was high only during spring and summer. Common dolphins and harbour porpoises were common in the study area during winter and spring. These baseline data will be used to assess potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of offshore wind power facilities in this region.","Abundance estimate; Atlantic ocean; Bottlenose dolphin; Common dolphin; Conservation; Distribution; Fin whale; Habitat; Harbour porpoise; Harbour seal; Humpback whale; Minke whale; Modelling; North Atlantic right whale; Survey-aerial; Survey-vessel","abundance; aerial survey; dolphin; environmental impact; harbor; nearshore environment; porpoise; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; vessel; whale; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); New Jersey; United States; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinus delphis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phoca vitulina; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,,"Able, K.W., Fahay, M.P., (1998) The First Year in the Life of Estuary Fishes in the Middle Atlantic Bight, , Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey; Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2009) Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, p. 316. , Perrin, W.

Based on data from visual surveys, much of the population migrates between winter calving grounds in coastal waters adjacent to the southeast USA and summer feeding and nursery grounds adjacent to the northeast USA. However, little is known about right whale occurrence along the mid-Atlantic US migratory corridor. A better understanding of right whale occurrence in this region is needed prior to offshore wind energy development activities, which may increase mortality risks and chronic impacts on the population. We conducted an 11 mo passive acoustic survey along coastal North Carolina and Georgia near several wind energy areas to document the acoustic occurrence of right whales in the southern region of the mid-Atlantic US coast. Right whales were acoustically detected across all seasons, with peak seasonal presence occurring during autumn in the Georgia site and during winter in the North Carolina site. A secondary peak in presence also occurred during June and July in the Georgia site, when right whales were not expected to be in the area. Given the nearly year-round presence of right whales in the survey areas, these results may warrant an evaluation of current management protocols in order to provide adequate protection to the population in the face of offshore energy development activities. © The authors 2015.","Distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; Management; Mid-Atlantic; Passive acoustic monitoring; Seasonality","anthropogenic effect; endangered species; geographical distribution; mortality; population migration; seasonal variation; seasonality; whale; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Georgia; North Carolina; United States; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Barco, S.G., McLellan, W.A., Allen, J.M., Asmutis-Silvia, R.A., Population identity of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the waters of the US mid-Atlantic states (2002) J Cetacean Res Manag, 4, pp. 135-141; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; XBAT R6: extensible bioacoustics tool (2012), www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/software/xbat-introduction, (accessed 18 Sep 2014); Atlantic OCS proposed geological and geophysical activities: Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas -Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (2012), 1, pp. 1-550. , OCS EIS/EA BOEM 2012-005; Atlantic OCS proposed geological and geophysical activities: Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas -Biological Assessment (2012), BOEM (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) BOEM, New Orleans, LA; Commercial leasing for wind power on the outer continental shelf offshore North Carolina-call for information and nominations (2012), 77, pp. 74204-74213. , Fed Regist BOEM; Calupca, T.A., Fristrup, K.M., Clark, C.W., A compact digital recording system for autonomous bioacoustic monitoring (2000) J Acoust Soc Am, 108, p. 2582; Cassoff, R.M., Moore, K.M., McLellan, W.A., Barco, S.G., Rotstein, D.S., Moore, M.J., Lethal entanglement in baleen whales (2011) Dis Aquat Org, 96, pp. 175-185; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., (1999) Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale.

Vessel collisions are a serious threat to the right whale and the program was among the first formal attempts to reduce this threat. Under the provisions of the MSR, all ships >300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination to a shore-based station when entering two key right whale habitats: one in waters off New England and one off coastal Georgia and Florida. In return, reporting ships receive an automatically-generated message, delivered directly to the ship's bridge, that provides information about right whale vulnerability to vessel collisions and actions mariners can take to avoid collisions. The MSR has been in operation continuously fromJuly 1999 to the present. Archived incoming reports provided a 15-plus year history of ship operations in these two locations. We analyzed a total of 26,772 incoming MSR messages logged between July 1999 and December 2013. Most ships that were required to report did so, and compliance rates were generally constant throughout the study period. Self-reported vessel speeds when entering the systems indicated that most ships travelled between 10 and 16 (range = 5-20+) knots. Ship speeds generally decreased in 2009 to 2013 following implementation of vessel speed restrictions. The number of reports into the southern systemremained relatively constant following a steady increase through 2007, but numbers in the northern system decreased annually beginning in 2008. If reporting is indicative of long-term patterns in shipping operations, it reflects noteworthy changes in marine transportation. Observed declines in ship traffic are likely attributable to the 2008-2009 economic recession, the containerized shipping industry making increased use of larger ships that made fewer trips, and diminished oil/gas US imports as previously inaccessible domestic deposits were exploited. Recent declines in shipping activity likely resulted in lowered collision risks for right whales and reduced their exposure to underwater noise fromships. © 2015 Silber et al.","Economic recession; Endangered whale; Endangered whale; International maritime organization; North Atlantic right whale; Ship collisions; Shipping industry; Underwater noise; US energy imports","Article; conservation biology; economic recession; Eubalaena glacialis; human; information processing; mandatory ship reporting system; nonhuman; quality control; sailor; ship; shipping; traffic accident; velocity; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Long-time trends in ship traffic noise for four sites off the North American west coast (2011) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 129, pp. 642-651; (2003) Notification of arrival, hazardous conditions and certain dangerous cargos., , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8bdc49164155dd7d628ba2ab77eba713&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title33/33CIsubchapP.tpl, Ports and Waterways Safety. 33 CFR 160; (1999) Establishment of Two Mandatory Ship Reporting Systems For the Protection of Northern Right Whales, , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8bdc49164155dd7d628ba2ab77eba713&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title33/33CIsubchapP.tpl, 33 CFR 169; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell, R.L., Jr., Baleen whales: conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Review, 29, pp. 35-60; Conn, P.B., Silber, G.K., Vessel speed restrictions reduce risk of collision-related mortality for North Atlantic right whales (2013) Ecosphere, 4 (43), pp. 1-15; Corbett, J.J., Marine transportation and energy use (2004) Encyclopedia of energy, pp. 745-748. , In: Cleveland CJ, ed.

Though not directly coincident with SMA implementation, right whale vessel-strike mortalities significantly declined from 2.0 (2000-2006) to 0.33 per year (2007-2012). Large whale vessel-strike mortalities have decreased inside active SMAs, and increased outside inactive SMAs. We detected no significant spatiotemporal interaction in the 4-year pre- or post-Rule periods, although a longer time series is needed to detect these changes. As designed, SMAs encompass only 36% of historical right whale vessel-strike mortalities, and 32% are outside managed space but within managed timeframes. We suggest increasing spatial coverage to improve the Rule's effectiveness. © 2014 The Authors.","Ocean management; Ocean zoning, mortality; Right whale; Ship strike; Speed limit; Whale","Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Anderson, M.J., Permutation tests for univariate or multivariate analysis of variance and regression (2001) Can.

BIAs are delineated for feeding areas, reproductive areas, migratory corridors, and small and resident populations to enhance existing information already available to scientists, man-agers, policymakers, and the public. BIAs ranged in size from approximately 152 to 270,000 km2. They are intended to provide synthesized infor-mation in a transparent format that can be readily used toward the analyses and planning under U.S. statutes that require the characterization and mini-mization of impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine mammals. BIAs are not intended to repre-sent all important areas for consideration in plan-ning processes; in particular, areas of high marine mammal density, typically identified based on a combination of systematic visual and/or acoustic detections coupled with quantitative modeling, are very important to consider, where available, in any assessment. To maintain their utility, East Coast BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.","Anthro-pogenic sound; East Coast; Feeding area; Migratory corridor; Northwest Atlantic Ocean; Reproductive area; Resident population","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Phocoena",,,,,,,,,"LaBrecque, E.; Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke UniversityUnited States; email: Erin.LaBrecque@duke.edu",,,"European Association for Aquatic Mammals",,,,,01675427,,,,"English","Aquatic Mamm.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955316799

We use a Brownian Bridge movement model to estimate individual movement patterns and spatial probability distributions using time- and location-specific photo-identified right whales from 1978 through 2007 to produce monthly estimates of movement and distribution patterns for the population in the NW Atlantic, from Cape Cod northward. For comparative purposes we also estimate right whale transition probabilities among ocean regions to estimate rates of emigration and immigration, likely destinations, and monthly regionally specific population estimates. Areas were identified that right whales may frequent and that are potential locations of the regularly unaccounted proportion of the population. These areas, requiring additional survey effort, include the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf, Columbia Ledges and western Jordan Basin. Our results show that along the northeast Atlantic coasts of Canada and the USA, right whales annually migrate in a general counter-clockwise pattern; north and east along the continental shelf in the spring and summer, and south and west along the coast during autumn and winter. The results also provide quantitative spatio-temporal estimates of right whales for all regions, including those that are rarely or never surveyed. The spatial probability distributions that we provide can be used in the future to quantitatively evaluate risks to right whales from human activities, particularly vessel traffic and commercial fishing, and thereby increase our ability to manage the risks and improve right whale conservation. © The authors 2015.","Brownian bridge; Movement; Random walk; Right whale; Time-space probability","Brownian motion; emigration; endangered species; immigration; movement; population distribution; probability; random walk method; spatial distribution; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Coast [Canada]; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Cape Cod; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Jordan Basin; Massachusetts; Scotia Shelf; United States; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC",,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of Northeast Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Block, B.A., Dewar, H., Blackwell, S.B., Williams, T.D., Migratory movements, depth preferences, and thermal biology of Atlantic bluefin tuna (2001) Science, 293, pp. 1310-1314; Bowne, D.R., Bowers, M.A., Interpatch movements in spatially structured populations: a literature review (2004) Landscape Ecol, 19, pp. 1-20; Brown, M.W., Fenton, D., Smedbol, K., Merriman, C., Robi chaud-Leblanc, K., Conway, J.D., (2009) Recovery strategy for the Northeast Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) in Atlantic Canadian waters [Final], , Species at Risk Act Recovery Strategy Series.

Data analysis was based on four days of acoustic recordings that were obtained with synchronized hydrophones. Based on temporal and geographical clustering of detected signals, 7264 NARW sounds were identified and associated with 559 signal trains. The detected signals were assigned to four classes of narrowband tonal calls - upcalls, downcalls, complex, and high frequency, and two classes of wideband sounds - gunshots and complex. Empirical distributions of the number of signals in trains, total duration of trains, the positions of NARW, and signal classes are presented. Results indicate that 68.9% of all signal trains consisted of 10 or fewer signals. Low and high frequency tonals that lacked wideband sounds formed 69.1% of trains; 5.0% of trains lacked tonals. Trains consisting of only upcalls comprised 44.2% of all detected trains. Because 18.3% of trains contained no upcalls, using detectors that identify all signal classes would improve right whale detection. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Cape cod bays; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic; Right whales; animal; Atlantic Ocean; bay; classification; comparative study; physiology; season; signal noise ratio; signal processing; social behavior; sound detection; vocalization; whale; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Bays; Seasons; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Social Behavior; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,,"Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald, T.L., Greene, C.R., Jr., Thode, A.M., Guerra, M., Macrander, A.M., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (2013) Mar.

Here, adaptive variation at the peptide binding region of class I and class II DRB-like genes of the major histocompatibility complex was assessed. Amplification of a duplicated region in 222 individuals revealed at least 11 class II alleles. Six alleles were assigned to the locus Eugl-DRB1 and 5 alleles were assigned to the locus Eugl-DRB2 by assessing segregation patterns of alleles from 81 parent/offspring pedigrees. Pedigree analysis indicated that these alleles segregated into 12 distinct haplotypes. Genotyping a smaller subset of unrelated individuals (n = 5 and 10, respectively) using different primer sets revealed at least 2 class II pseudogenes (with ≥ 4 alleles) and at least 3 class I loci (with ≥ 6 alleles). Class II sequences were significantly different from neutrality at peptide binding sites suggesting loci may be under the influence of balancing selection. Trans-species sharing of alleles was apparent for class I and class II sequences. Characterization of class II loci represents the first step in determining the relationship between major histocompatibility complex variability and factors affecting health and reproduction in this species. © The American Genetic Association 2013.","DRB like; Eubalaena glacialis; haplotype; MHC; North Atlantic right whale; pedigree analysis","peptide; Article; balancing selection; binding site; controlled study; drb1 gene; drb2 gene; female; gene amplification; gene duplication; gene frequency; gene locus; gene segregation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotyping technique; haplotype; histocompatibility gene; major histocompatibility antigen class 1 gene; major histocompatibility antigen class 2 gene; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parent; pedigree analysis; progeny; pseudogene; whale; Eubalaena glacialis; DRB like; Eubalaena glacialis; haplotype; MHC; North Atlantic right whale; pedigree analysis; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Female; Genes, MHC Class I; Genes, MHC Class II; Genetic Loci; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; Pedigree; Phylogeny; Selection, Genetic; Whales","GENBANK: KF137604:KF137605",,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: CGSD3-316704-2005","Penzance Foundation through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Ocean Life Institute Right Whale Initiative (agreement number A-100374); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Drawing upon the successful Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary model, we propose a multi-stakeholder marine spatial planning process that considers both appropriate positioning of offshore wind farms and redefining commercial shipping lanes relative to whale migration routes: placement of wind turbines within certain right whale habitats may prove beneficial for the species. To that end, it may be advisable to initially relocate the shipping lanes for the benefit of the whales prior to selecting wind energy areas. The optimal end-state is the commercial viability of renewable energy, as well as a safe shipping infrastructure, with minimal risk of collision and exposure to shipping noise for the whales. This opportunity to manage impacts on right whales could serve as a model for other problematic interactions between marine life and commercial activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anthropogenic noise; Eubalaena glacialis; Marine spatial planning; Offshore wind; Right whale; Shipping","Freight transportation; Offshore wind farms; Renewable energy resources; Anthropogenic noise; Eubalaena glacialis; Marine Spatial Planning; Offshore winds; Right whales; Ships; commercialization; disturbance; infrastructural development; marine environment; offshore structure; spatial planning; whale; wind farm; article; commercial phenomena; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental protection; Eubalaena glacialis; habitat selection; human; marine environment; marine spatial planning; noise pollution; nonhuman; population migration; renewable energy; safety; shipping; spatial analysis; species conservation; species habitat; traffic accident; whale; wind power; wind turbine; animal; Atlantic Ocean; ecosystem; geography; international cooperation; noise; physiology; procedures; ship; traffic and transport; whale; wind; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Animal Migration; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; International Cooperation; Noise; Renewable Energy; Ships; Transportation; Whales; Wind",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","We wish to thank Cormac Booth, Sarah Dolman, Patrick Gilman, Tonya Wimmer and Scott Kraus and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful discussion and comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22uC SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. © 2014 Lihong et al.",,"article; calf (mammal); Eubalaena glacialis; geographic and geological parameters; habitat; isotherm; latitude; nonhuman; population migration; sea surface temperature; seashore; species distribution; statistical model; time; United States; water depth; whale; winter; animal; ecosystem; female; male; physiology; season; statistical model; whale; Animal Migration; Animals; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Models, Statistical; Seasons; Southeastern United States; Whales",,,,,,,,"Waring, G.T., Josephson, E., Maze-Foley, K., Rosel, P.E., Editors, U.

Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22°C SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. Copyright © 2014 Gowan, Ortega-Ortiz.

The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is an endangered baleen whale species that produces a variety of stereotyped acoustic signals. One of these signals, the ""gunshot"" sound, has only been recorded from adult male North Atlantic right whales and is thought to function for reproduction, either as reproductive advertisement for females or as an agonistic signal toward other males. This study uses remote acoustic monitoring to analyze the presence of gunshots over a two-year period at two sites on the Scotian Shelf to determine if there is evidence that North Atlantic right whales may use these locations for breeding activities. Seasonal analyses at both locations indicate that gunshot sound production is highly seasonal, with an increase in the autumn. One site, Roseway West, had significantly more gunshot sounds overall and exhibited a clear diel trend in production of these signals at night. The other site, Emerald South, also showed a seasonal increase in gunshot production during the autumn, but did not show any significant diel trend. This difference in gunshot signal production at the two sites indicates variation either in the number or the behavior of whales at each location. The timing of the observed seasonal increase in gunshot sound production is consistent with the current understanding of the right whale breeding season, and our results demonstrate that detection of gunshots with remote acoustic monitoring can be a reliable way to track shifts in distribution and changes in acoustic behavior including possible mating activities. © 2014 Matthews et al.",,"acoustics;

The evolution of online social networks offers new possibilities for collecting data about public interest. Building on an analysis of text messages on Twitter, this study aimed to quantify the level of public attention toward different mammal and bird species listed (at the full species or subspecies/population level) under the United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA). Once a month during 1 year, I searched recently posted messages ('tweets') for the common names of every listed species. The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) was by far the most tweeted species. The other most tweeted mammals were the American bison (Bison bison), brown bear (U. arctos), cougar (Puma concolor), killer whale (Orcinus orca), black bear (U. americanus) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), respectively. The three most frequently tweeted birds were the sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), whooping crane (G. americana) and spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Some species, such as the manatee, right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) ranked higher when restricting the search to conservation contexts. The results suggest that Twitter users interact about a biased sample of ESA-listed species: mammals were better represented than birds among the most tweeted species and larger-sized species received more tweets. The findings can be used for prioritizing conservation education and marketing campaigns aiming to raise the profile of lesser-known listed species. Data from online social networks open the door for a range of novel applications in conservation science. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Endangered Species Act; Microblogs; Online networking services; Public attention; Species at risk; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Ballouard, J.-M., Brischoux, F., Bonnet, X., Children prioritize virtual exotic biodiversity over local biodiversity (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (8), pp. e23152; Barua, M., Root-Bernstein, M., Ladle, R.J., Jepson, P., Defining flagship uses is critical for flagship selection: a critique of the IUCN climate change flagship fleet (2011) Ambio, 40, pp. 431-435; (2012) An exhaustive study of Twitter users across the world, , http://www.beevolve.com/twitter-statistics/, Beevolve, Beevolve Technologies, London, Accessed 15 Oct 2012; Bik, H.M., Goldstein, M.C., An introduction to social media for scientists (2013) PLoS Biol, 11 (4), pp. e1001535; Caro, T., (2010) Conservation by Proxy: Indicator, Umbrella, Keystone, Flagship and Other Surrogate Species, , Washington, DC: Island Press; Chew, C., Eysenbach, G., Pandemics in the age of Twitter: content analysis of tweets during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak (2010) PLoS ONE, 5, pp. e14118; Clark, J.A., May, R.M., Taxonomic bias in conservation research (2002) Science, 297, pp. 191-202; Clucas, B., McHugh, K., Caro, T., Flagship species on covers of US conservation and nature magazines (2008) Biodivers Conserv, 17, pp. 1517-1528; Czech, B., Krausman, P.R., Borkhataria, R., Social construction, political power, and the allocation of benefits to endangered species (1998) Conserv Biol, 12, pp. 1103-1112; Eysenbach, G., Infodemiology: the epidemiology of (mis)information (2002) Am J Med, 113, pp. 763-765; Gavin, M.C., Solomon, J.N., Blank, S.G., Measuring and monitoring illegal use of natural resources (2010) Conserv Biol, 24, pp. 89-100; Golbeck, J., Grimes, J.M., Rogers, A., Twitter use by the US congress (2010) J Am Soc Inf Sci Technol, 61, pp. 1612-1621; Gonçalves, B., Perra, N., Vespignani, A., Modeling user's activity on Twitter networks: validation of Dunbar's number (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (8), pp. e22656; Heberlein, T.A., Navigating environmental attitudes (2012) Conserv Biol, 26, pp. 583-585; Kalland, A., Management by totemization: whale symbolism and the anti-whaling campaign (1993) Arctic, 46, pp. 124-133; Kareiva, P., Marvier, M., What is conservation science?

It is generally accepted that it was the main prey of coastal whaling in the Middle Ages and in the pre-modern period, but this assumption still needs firming up based on biological and archaeological evidence. We describe the skeletal remains of right whales excavated at Peniche in 2001-2002, in association with archaeological artefacts. The whale bones were covered by sandy sediments on the old seashore and they have been tentatively dated around the 16th to 17th centuries. This study contributes material evidence to the former occurrence of E. glacialis in Portugal (West Iberia). Some whale bones show unequivocal man-made scars. These are associated to wounds from instruments with a sharp-cutting blade. This evidence for past human interaction may suggest that whaling for that species was active at Peniche around the early 17th century. © 2014 Teixeira et al.",,"animal tissue; archeology; article; cervical spine; Eubalaena glacialis; growth plate; history; nonhuman; occipital bone; population abundance; Portugal; seashore; skeleton; skull; species extinction; species identification; ulna; whale; Animals; Female; Fossils; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; Humans; Male; Portugal; Whales",,,,,,,,"(2012) IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, , www.iucnredlist.org, Version 2012.2.

The Canadian Species at Risk Recovery Strategy for right whales provides provisional Critical Habitat (CH) boundaries for Roseway Basin based on right whale occupancy, with the stipulation that the boundaries be refined using spatially explicit indicators of CH, specifically the environmental, oceanographic, and bathymetric conditions responsible for the copepod aggregations and distribution. We measured the concentration, energy density, spatial distribution, and extent of the right whale food base and the related oceanography at depth in the Basin during late-summer 2008 with the goal of refining the spatial extent of right whale CH. We show that the diapausing copepods were distributed throughout the Basin, with elevated concentrations located at depth toward the northeast and along the southern Basin margin slope. The aggregations were associated with warm, salty, high-density (26.0 to 26.2 δt, kg m-3), continental slope-influenced water masses and not with cold, fresh, low-density (&lt;26.0 δt) water masses originating on the Scotian Shelf. Tidally driven variation in the copepod aggregations across the southern slope was coincident with the movement of the 26.0 δt isopycnal. We propose a mechanism, based on water mass density and advection, that explains the spatial and temporal (e.g. inter-annual) variation in diapausing Calanus energy density (joules per unit ocean volume) distribution, and by proxy, variation in right whale occupancy of the Basin. We further propose that the provisional CH boundaries, partly conditioned on vessel-strike mitigation measures, be extended to better encompass the critical feeding habitat. This could be achieved without compromise regarding vessel traffic and existing vessel-strike mitigation. © 2014 Inter-Research.","Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus hyperboreus; Conservation; Critical Habitat; North Atlantic right whale; Roseway Basin; Slope water; Water mass density",,,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Baumgartner, M.F., Tvn, C., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Baumgartner, M.F., Tvn, C., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Mayo, C.A., Kenney, R.D., Enormous carnivores, microscopic food and a restaurant that's hard to find (2007) The Urban Whale: North Atlantic Right Whales at the Crossroads, pp. 138-171. , Krauss SD, Rolland R (eds) .

Such efforts require information on the spatial and temporal distribution of right whales that can be analyzed against risk factors to identify solutions to protect whales while minimizing economic impacts to industry. Currently, no methods adequately make use of all available data to characterize right whale distribution, often leaving data gaps or misrepresenting whale activity in areas where we have limited systematic survey data. In response to this, an areal co-kriging interpolation technique was developed using ArcGIS 10.1 Geostatistical Analyst, utilizing all available right whale location data including systematic survey data, opportunistic sightings data, and satellite tag data. With many management plans shaped around specific geographic zones, this methodology was developed with the option to summarize information within user-defined polygons depending on the management regime. For this paper, whale distribution predictions were summarized to 524 irregularly shaped polygons off coastal Maine, representing lobster fishing zones at a 2 mo temporal scale. Results indicate that the predicted values fall within reasonable ranges, appropriately represent seasonal differences, and better represent right whale distribution patterns compared to other methods. © Inter-Research 2014.","Cetacean abundance; Conservation; Endangered species; Habitat-based density model; Marine mammal; Modeling; Right whale; Spatial distribution; Wildlife management","ecological modeling; endangered species; fishing gear; GIS; kriging; mortality; risk factor; whale; wildlife management; Maine; United States; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Bolstad, P., GIS fundamentals (2008) A first text on geographic information systems, , 3rd edn.

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of right whales on their foraging grounds increases detection opportunities to inform mariners of right whale presence and reduce the likelihood of ship strike. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PAM on right whale calving grounds by documenting the occurrence of right whale call detections on 2 types of acoustic instruments deployed off the coasts of Savannah, GA, and Jacksonville, FL, and comparing results with visual sightings and ambient noise conditions. Over 400 right whale calling events were detected on archival marine acoustic recording units (MARUs) at 2 sites across 2 seasons, and 92% of these calling events included right whale upcalls. Daily detections on archival MARUs and near-real time Autobuoys, which automatically detect upcalls, were significantly correlated and occurred on up to 25% of days off Savannah and 46% of days off Jacksonville. Visual aerial surveys detected right whales within 20km of each acoustic site on a similar proportion of days with visual survey effort (15 to 33% off Savannah and 34 to 43% off Jacksonville). Acoustic methods enabled greater temporal effort, yielding a 2- to 10-fold increase in days with right whale detections over visual methods. Shipping noise and fish chorusing likely mask right whale call detections. However, considering the high number of right whale calling event detections by PAM during this study the results indicate that this is an effective method to augment detection of right whales in this environment, especially at night when they cannot be seen.","Marine mammal Monitoring Distribution Eubalaena glacialis Passive acoustic Ambient noise","acoustic method; bioacoustics; calling behavior; foraging behavior; whale; Florida [United States]; Georgia; United States; Balaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Aguilar de Soto, N., Madsen, P.T., Tyack, P., Arranz, P., No shallow talk: Cryptic strategy in the vocal communication of Blainville's beaked whales (2012) Mar Mamm Sci, 28, pp. E75-E92; Aguilar Soto, N., Johnson, M.P., Madsen, P.T., Díaz, F., Do mínguez, I., Brito, A., Tyack, P., Cheetahs of the deep sea: deep foraging sprints in short-finned pilot whales off Tenerife (Canary Islands) (2008) J Anim Ecol, 77, pp. 936-947; Baumgartner, M.F., Fratantoni, D.M., Diel periodicity in both sei whale vocalization rates and the vertical migration of their copepod prey observed from ocean gliders (2008) Limnol Oceanogr, 53, pp. 2197-2209; Burtenshaw, J.C., Oleson, E.M., Hildebrand, J.A., McDonald, M.A., Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Acoustic and satellite remote sensing of blue whale seasonality and habitat in the Northeast Pacific (2004) Deep-Sea Res II, 51, pp. 967-986; Calupca, T.A., Fristrup, K.M., Clark, C.W., A compact digital recording system for autonomous bioacoustic monitoring (2000) J Acoust Soc Am, 108, p. 2582; Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative analysis (1982) Anim Behav, 30, pp. 1060-1071; Clark, C.W., Acoustic communication and behavior of the southern right whale, Eubalaena australis (1983), pp. 163-198. , In: Payne R (ed) Communication and behavior of whales.

Under articles of the Act, the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) was developed and implemented to reduce entanglement mortality of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, Gulf of Maine humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, and western North Atlantic fin whales Balaenoptera physalus by requiring modifications to commercial fishing gear (i.e. pots and sink gillnets). Although they undercount the number of entanglements, counts of detected incidents of entanglements and entanglement-related mortality are the primary index to entanglement mortality. We analyzed the annual counts of large whale entanglements including serious injuries and mortalities attributed to entanglements to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALWTRP from 1999 to 2009. The annual number of mortality events (including serious injuries) related to fishing gear entanglements averaged 2.5 for right whales, 6.5 for humpbacks, 0.6 for fin whales, and 2.4 for minke whales B. acutorostrata. Annual entanglement rates increased during the study period, but evidence for increased rates of entanglement-related mortality was equivocal. No significant changes occurred in waiting time (the number of days between entanglement events) in response to any management measures implemented to reduce large whale mortalities between 1998 and 2009, implying that these measures were generally ineffective in abating whale deaths from entanglements in fishing gear.","By-catch; Efficacy tests; Human-caused mortality; Large whales","bycatch; fishing gear; injury; mortality; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Maine; United States; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., (2008) Model based inference in the life sciences: a primer on evidence., , Springer, New York, NY; Dixon, P.M., Ellison, A.M., Gotelli, N.J., Improving the precision of estimates of rare events (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1114-1123; Fujiwara, M., Caswell, H., Demography of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 537-541; Gulland, F.M.D., (2006) Review of the Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event Response Program of the National Marine Fisheries Service., , NOAA Tech Memo NMFS-OPR-33.

The confined nature of the Bering Strait forces both vessel traffic and the migrating Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales to occupy the same narrow space, thus putting individual animals at risk of vessel strike. The potential for vessel strike may become exacerbated as the reduction of Arctic sea ice makes the Arctic increasingly accessible, allowing vessels to transit through the Strait in greater densities. In drawing from lessons learned in the successful reduction of vessel strike to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), the author provides broad recommendations for implementing ships' routeing measures in the Bering Strait region based on findings by Citta et al. (2012). It is recommended that both the western side of Big Diomede Island and the western side of St. Lawrence Island be designated as seasonal Areas To Be Avoided (ATBA) during fall months when bowheads are known to inhabit the area. Alternatively, it is proposed that Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) be implemented so that vessels must keep to the eastern side of both Big Diomede Island and St. Lawrence Island during this time. Both measures would reduce the amount of overlap between migrating bowhead whales and transiting vessel traffic, effectively reducing the potential for vessel strike. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bering strait; Bowhead whale; Conservation; International maritime organization (IMO); North Atlantic right whale; Ships' routeing","environmental protection; international organization; population dynamics; population migration; risk assessment; routing; sea ice; species conservation; vessel; whale; marine policy; ship motion; shipping; transportation safety; maritime transportation; migratory population; vessel traffic management system; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Beaufort Sea; Bering Strait; Chukchi Sea; Saint Lawrence Island; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Ellis, B., (2009), p. 194. , Brigham L Arctic marine shipping assessment (AMSA) 2009 report.

As a result, animals migrating over large ranges or widely distributed species are now exposed to a myriad of different acoustic environments, within which they must navigate, forage and reproduce. Given current increases in low-frequency (<. 1000. Hz) anthropogenic noise, there is concern that resultant masking of communication and naturally occurring sounds may stress cetaceans already facing other forms of habitat degradation. As a critical first step to understanding the acoustic environments of coastal marine ecosystems, we examined month-long acoustic data from ten sites along the U.S. east coast that are either designated critical habitats or located along the migratory corridor of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis): Gulf of Maine, Jeffreys Ledge, Massachusetts Bay, Cape Cod Bay, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia (North), and Georgia (South). Data were collected using hydrophones positioned at depth to evaluate differences in the acoustic environment at these sites. High noise levels were observed at both major (New York, Boston) and non-major (Georgia) shipping ports located in or near the areas of study. Of the ten study sites, New Jersey and New York experienced the highest equivalent sound levels, while South Carolina and the Gulf of Maine presented the lowest. The majority of noise variability was found in low-frequency bands below 500. Hz, including the 71-224. Hz communication range utilized by long distance, contact-calling right whales and many other whale and fish species. The spatio-temporal variability of anthropogenic noise can be viewed as a form of habitat fragmentation, where inundations of noise may mask key sounds, resulting in a loss of ""acoustic space"" (overlapping frequency band and time of a whale's vocalization), which could otherwise be occupied by vocalizations and other acoustic cues utilized by cetaceans. This loss of acoustic space could potentially degrade habitat suitability by reducing the geographic distance across which individuals acoustically communicate, and ultimately, over long timescales, disrupt aspects related to their natural behavior and ecology. Because communication plays a vital role in the life history of cetacean species, understanding temporal and geographical differences in ambient noise as part of cetacean ecology and habitat may elucidate future conservation strategies related to the assessment of noise impacts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Acoustic communication; Ambient noise; Anthropogenic noise; Fish; Whale","Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"New York State Department of Environmental Conservation

To evaluate the effectiveness of this rule, we plotted the locations of all right whale and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae carcasses attributed to ship-strikes since December 1990 in US waters to determine their proximity to SMAs. In the 18 yr pre-rule period, 13 of 15 (87%) right whales and 12 of 26 (46%) humpback whales killed by ships were found inside later SMA boundaries or within 45 nmi (83 km) of their perimeters during later active dates. In the first 5 yr after the rule became effective, no ship-struck right whales were found inside or within 45 nmi of any active SMA. This was nearly twice as long as the longest pre-rule period without discovery of a ship-struck carcass in those areas during effective time periods. Based on the 18 yr pre-rule period, bootstrap resampling analyses revealed that the probability of finding no ship-struck whales in or near SMAs during the first 5 yr post-rule period would be a statistically significant reduction in such deaths (p = 0.031). The results suggest the rule has been effective at reducing right whale deaths. We suggest enlarging SMAs to include additional parts of the right whale migratory corridor. © Inter-Research 2014.","Conservation; Humpback whales; North Atlantic right whales; Ship strikes; Vessel speed limits",,,,,,,,,"Asaro, M.J., Geospatial analysis of management areas implemented for protection of the North Atlantic right whale along the northern Atlantic coast of the United States (2012) Mar Policy, 36, pp. 915-921; Clyne, H., Computer simulations of interactions between the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and shipping (1999) Masters thesis in Software Technology, , Napier University, Edinburgh; Conn, P.B., Silber, G.K., Vessel speed restrictions reduce risk of collision-related mortality for North Atlantic right whales (2013) Ecosphere, 4 (4); Efron, B., Tibshirani, R.J., (1993) An introduction to the bootstrap., , Chapman & Hall, New York, NY; Fonnesbeck, C.J., Garrison, L.P., Ward-Geiger, L.I., Baumstark, R.D., Bayesian hierarchical model for evaluating the risk of vessel strikes on North Atlantic right whales in the SE United States (2008) Endang Species Res, 6, pp. 87-94; Gende, S.M., Hendrix, A.N., Harris, K.R., Eichenlaub, B., Nielson, J., Pyare, S., A Bayesian approach for understanding the role of ship speed in whale-ship encounters (2011) Ecol Appl, 21, pp. 2232-2240; Geraci, J.R., Lounsbury, V.J., (2005) Marine mammals ashore: a field guide for strandings, 2nd edn., , National Aquarium in Baltimore, Baltimore, MD; Keller, C.A., Garrison, L., Baumstark, R., Ward-Geiger, L.I., Hines, E., Application of a habitat model to define calving habitat of the North Atlantic right whale in the southeastern United States (2012) Endang Species Res, 18, pp. 73-87; Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Mortality and serious injury of northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the western North Atlantic Ocean (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, 2, pp. 193-208; Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Kenney, R.D., Reproduction in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (1994) Can J Zool, pp. 1297-1305; Knowlton, A.R., Korsmeyer, F.T., Kerwin, J.E., Wu, H.Y., Haynes, B., The hydrodynamic effects of large vessels on right whales (1995), Contract No. 40ANFF400534, final report to the National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Woods Hole, MA; Knowlton, A.R., Hamilton, P.K., Marx, M.K., Pettis, H.M., Kraus, S.D., Monitoring North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis entanglement rates: a 30 yr retrospective (2012) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 466, pp. 293-302; Kraus, S.D., Brown, M.W., Caswell, H., Clark, C.W., North Atlantic right whales in crisis (2005) Science, 309, pp. 561-562; Lagueux, K.M., Zani, M.A., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Response by vessel operators to protection measures for right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the southeast US calving ground (2011) Endang Species Res, 14, pp. 69-77; Laist, D.W., Knowlton, A.R., Mead, J.G., Collet, A.S., Podesta, M., Collisions between ships and whales (2001) Mar Mamm Sci, 17, pp. 35-75; The biological viability of the most endangered marine mammals and the cost effectiveness of protection programs: a report to Congress from the Marine Mammal Commission.

We examined changes in kinematics of a tagged entangled North Atlantic right whale (Eg 3911), before, during, and after disentanglement on 15 January 2011. To calculate the additional drag forces and energetic demand associated with various gear configurations, we towed three sets of gear attached to a load-cell tensiometer at multiple speeds. Tag analyses revealed significant increases in dive depth and duration; ascent, descent and fluke stroke rates; and decreases in root mean square fluke amplitude (a proxy for thrust) following disentanglement. Conservative drag coefficients while entangled in all gear configurations (mean ± SD Cd,e,go = 3.4 × 10-3 ± 0.0003, Cd,e,gb = 3.7 × 10-3 ± 0.0003, Cd,e,sl = 3.8 × 10-3 ± 0.0004) were significantly greater than in the nonentangled case (Cd,n = 3.2 × 10-3 ± 0.0003; P = 0.0156, 0.0312, 0.0078, respectively). Increases in total power input (including standard metabolism) over the nonentangled condition ranged from 1.6% to 120.9% for all gear configurations tested; locomotory power requirements increased 60.0%-164.6%. These results highlight significant alteration to swimming patterns, and the magnitude of energy depletion in a chronically entangled whale. © 2013 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Disentanglement; Drag; Dtag; Energetics; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Right whale; Sedation","anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; bioenergetics; drag coefficient; energy budget; environmental disturbance; fishing gear; foraging behavior; kinematics; locomotion; swimming behavior; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Trematoda",,,,,,,,"Alexander, D.E., Drag coefficients of swimming animals: effects of using different reference areas (1990) Biological Bulletin, 179, pp. 186-190; Andrews, R., Pitman, R., Ballance, L., Satellite tracking reveals distinct movement patterns for Type B and Type C killer whales in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica (2008) Polar Biology, 31, pp. 1461-1468; Aoki, K., Watanabe, Y.Y., Crocker, D.E., Northern elephant seals adjust gliding and stroking patterns with changes in buoyancy: Validation of at-sea metrics of body density (2011) Journal of Experimental Biology, 214, pp. 2973-2987; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Bill, R.G., Herrnkind, W.F., Drag reduction by formation movement in spiny lobsters (1976) Science, 193, pp. 1146-1148; Blake, R.W., (1983) Fish locomotion, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K; Cassoff, R.M., Moore, K.M., McLellan, W.A., Barco, S.G., Rotstein, D.S., Moore, M.J., Lethal entanglement in baleen whales (2011) Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 96, pp. 175-185; Cavatorta, D., Starczak, V., Prada, K.E., Moore, M.J., A note on the friction of different ropes in right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) baleen: An entanglement model (2005) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 7, pp. 39-42; Clapham, P.J., Young, S., Brownell Jr, R.J., Baleen whales: conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Review, 29, pp. 35-60; Devore, J., (2008) Probability and statistics for engineering and the sciences, , Thomson Higher Education, Belmont, CA; Dunkin, R.C., McLellan, W.A., Blum, J.E., Pabst, D.A., The buoyancy of the integument of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): Effects of growth, reproduction, and nutritional state (2010) Marine Mammal Science, 26, pp. 573-587; Fahlman, A., The pressure to understand the mechanism of lung compression and its effect on lung function (2008) Journal of Applied Physiology, 104, pp. 907-908; Fahlman, A., Wilson, R., Svärd, C., Rosen, D.A.S., Trites, A.W., Activity and diving metabolism correlate in Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus (2008) Aquatic Biology, 2, pp. 75-84; Fedak, M.A., Lovell, P., Grant, S.M., Two approaches to compressing and interpreting time-depth information as collected by time-depth recorders and satellite-linked data recorders (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 94-100; Feldkamp, S.D., The effects of net entanglement on the drag and power output of a California sea lion, Zalophus californianus (1985) Fishery Bulletin, 83, pp. 692-695; Feldkamp, S.D., Costa, D.P., DeKrey, G.K., Energetic and behavioral effects of net entanglement on juvenile northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus (1988) Fishery Bulletin, 87, pp. 85-94; Fish, F.E., Power output and propulsive efficiency of swimming bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) (1993) Journal of Experimental Biology, 185, pp. 179-193; Fish, F.E., Kinematics of ducklings swimming in formation: Consequences of position (1995) Journal of Experimental Zoology, 273, pp. 1-11; Fish, F.E., Comparative kinematics and hydrodynamics of odontocete cetaceans: Morphological and ecological correlates with swimming performance (1998) Journal of Experimental Biology, 201, pp. 2867-2877; Fish, F.E., Rohr, J.J., (1999), p. 193. , Review of dolphin hydrodynamics and swimming performance.

Marine mammals use blubber as an energy reserve, but because this tissue is also positively buoyant, nutritional demands have the potential to cause considerable variation in buoyancy. North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis are known to be positively buoyant as a result of their blubber, and the thickness of this layer varies considerably, but the effect of this variation on buoyancy has not been explored. This study compared the duration and rate of ascending and descending glides, recorded with an archival tag, with blubber thickness, measured with an ultrasound device, in free-swimming right whales. Ascending whales with thicker blubber had shorter portions of active propulsion and longer passive glides than whales with thinner blubber, suggesting that blubber thickness influences buoyancy because the buoyant force is acting in the same direction as the animal's movement during this phase. Whales with thinner layers also used similar body angles and velocities when traveling to and from depth, while those with thicker layers used shallower ascent angles but achieved higher ascent velocities. Such alterations in body angle may help to reduce the cost of transport when swimming against the force of buoyancy in a state of augmented positive buoyancy, which represents a dynamic response to reduce the energetic consequences of physiological changes. These results have considerable implications for any diving marine animal during periods of nutritional stress, such as during seasonal migrations and annual variations in prey availability. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

Gray whales, however, also inhabited the North Atlantic Ocean until recent historical times (~. 1600. AD), leaving open questions about their historical ecology in nearshore communities of this basin. Here we report the discovery of fossil remains from two individual gray whales recovered from underwater excavations at separate localities of JY Reef, an offshore reef situated approximately 32. kilometers (km) offshore of St. Catherine's Island, Georgia, U.S.A. Both mandibles are diagnostic to the living E. robustus. Radiometric dating of shells from JY Reef suggests an approximate age range of these two specimens between 42 and 30. thousand years before present (ka). Morphological measurements of the preserved elements indicate that both of the mandibles likely belonged to immature and possibly yearling individuals. Collectively, these findings are among the oldest occurrences of gray whales in the North Atlantic basin, and their presence at temperate latitudes provides limited support for the hypothesis that Atlantic gray whales used a southerly breeding area at the end of a migratory pathway, by analog with lagoonal breeding environments of Baja California, Mexico, for the extant California gray whales, and the breeding areas for the extant North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) off the Georgia coast today. Stronger support for this latter contention may stem from future fossil discoveries in the region, as well as ancillary lines of evidence, such as the remains of species-specific ectoparasites and/or ancient DNA (aDNA).© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Ocean; Fossil; Gray whale; Migration; Pleistocene","breeding site; fossil record; historical ecology; morphology; paleontology; Pleistocene; shell; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Georgia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Saint Catherines Island; United States",,,,,"Smithsonian Institution, SI","The authors wish to thank GRNMS-NOAA for the use of the R/V Joe Ferguson and NOAA divers C.

Underwater vocalizations were recorded using autonomous buoys deployed in close proximity to surface active groups (SAGs). Nine main vocalization types were identified with manual inspection of spectrograms, and standard acoustic descriptors were extracted. Classification trees were used to examine the distinguishing characteristics of calls and quantify their variability within the SAG vocal repertoire. The results show that descriptors of frequency, bandwidth, and spectral disorder are the most important parameters for partitioning the SAG repertoire, contrary to duration-related measures. The reported source levels and vocalization statistics provide sound production data vital to inform regional passive acoustic monitoring and conservation for this endangered species. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Classification trees; Endangered species; Eubalaena glacialis; Manual inspection; Passive acoustic monitoring; Passive acoustics; Sound production; Vocal repertoire; Architectural acoustics; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Conservation; Ecosystems; acoustics; animal; automated pattern recognition; classification; devices; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental monitoring; female; male; maternal behavior; newborn; physiology; pressure transducer; procedures; psychology; reproduction; sea; signal processing; social behavior; sound detection; species difference; United States; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Male; Maternal Behavior; Oceans and Seas; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproduction; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Social Behavior; Sound Spectrography; Southeastern United States; Species Specificity; Transducers, Pressure; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Florida Atlantic University Foundation, FAUF","We thank Scott Kraus (New England Aquarium) for authorization to conduct this research under his permit.

Two primary tools are given to US wildlife managers by the Endangered Species Act post-listing to ensure species survival by reducing negative anthropogenic impacts: (1) creating a recovery plan and (2) defining and protecting critical habitat. This study reviews and analyzes the impact these strategies have had in reducing North Atlantic right whale ship strike mortality in US waters from 1973 to 2011. Defining and protecting critical habitat poses distinct spatial and human-use overlap challenges when applied to highly migratory species. Managers should consider two different levels in designating critical habitat for highly migratory species such as the North Atlantic right whale: permanently protected critical habitat in areas where species take up seasonal residence, and temporarily protected migratory habitat to maintain functional migration corridors between seasonal residence critical habitat areas. Managers and stakeholders should also be aware that, given current definitions for North Atlantic right whale critical habitat, human-use overlap in critical habitat areas is inevitable. Instead of eliminating human-use in critical habitat, wildlife managers should apply a combination of adaptive human-behaviors, functional habitat definitions, and on-going habitat-use studies to reduce ship strike mortality, particularly for pregnant and nursing females. Ascertaining methods to effectively manage North Atlantic right whale critical habitat is particularly relevant as current regulatory actions aimed at reducing North Atlantic right whale ship strike mortality will be reviewed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in December 2013, offering wildlife managers an opportunity to adjust current ship strike mortality reduction strategies in order to improve the population growth rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical habitat; Eubalaena glacialis; Habitat fragmentation; North Atlantic right whale; Ship strike","anthropogenic effect; ecological impact; endangered species; Endangered Species Act; growth rate; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; mortality; population growth; population migration; recovery plan; regulatory framework; whale; wildlife management; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",,,,,"University of Maine

Here it is shown that an autocorrelation method coupled with the direct reflected time difference of arrival localization technique can successfully resolve location information. A derivation was made to model the autocorrelation of a direct signal and its overlapping reflections to illustrate that an autocorrelation may be used to extract reflection information from longer duration signals containing a frequency sweep, such as some calls produced by baleen whales. An analysis was performed to characterize the difference in behavior of the autocorrelation when applied to call types with varying parameters (sweep rate, call duration). The method's feasibility was tested using data from playback transmissions to localize an acoustic transducer at a known depth and location. The method was then used to estimate the depth and range of a single North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) from two separate experiments. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Autocorrelation methods; Eubalaena glacialis; Frequency sweep; Humpback whales; Localization technique; Location information; Time difference of arrival; Varying parameters; Autocorrelation; Tracking (position); acoustics; animal; automated pattern recognition; conference paper; environmental monitoring; equipment; feasibility study; humpback whale; marine biology; methodology; physiology; psychological aspect; sea; signal processing; sound detection; swimming; time; transducer; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Feasibility Studies; Humpback Whale; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Swimming; Time Factors; Transducers; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,,"Aguilar De Soto, N., Madsen, P.T., Tyack, P., Arranz, P., Marrero, J., Fais, A., Revelli, E., Johnson, M., No shallow talk: Cryptic strategy in the vocal communication of Blainville's beaked whales (2012) Marine Mammal Sci., 28, pp. 75-E92. , 10.1111/j.1748-7692.2011.00495.x; Aubauer, R., Lammers, M.O., Au, W.W.L., One hydrophone method of estimating distance and depth of phonating dolphins in shallow water (2000) J.

The largest population is the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), with circumpolar distribution in the southern hemisphere. One calving area for this population is in Brazilian waters, where increasing numbers of right whales have been sighted over the past decade along with an increase in anthropogenic activities including shipping traffic and fishing. The goals of this study were to describe the vocal behavior of southern right whales in Brazilian waters, assess the difference in vocalizations between areas with low and high human activity, and compare these results to studies conducted with North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Western North Atlantic. Bottom-mounted archival acoustic recorders were deployed in October and November 2011 in two coastal locations in central Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. One recorder was placed off Gamboa (27°56'S and 48°39'W, low traffic) and a second off Ribanceira (28°11'S and 48°37'W, high traffic). Automated detectors and noise statistic analysis tools developed for North Atlantic right whale upcalls were utilized to analyze the dataset. Calls produced by Brazilian whales were significantly lower in fundamental frequency than North Atlantic right whale calls and the implications for these results will be discussed. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Anthropogenic activity; Automated detectors; Coastal locations; Eubalaena glacialis; Fundamental frequencies; Human activities; Shipping traffic; Southern Hemisphere; Oceanography",,,,,,,,"Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative-analysis (1982) Anim.

While evidence of individual body condition can be obtained, these observations provide just brief glimpses into the health state of the animal. An analytical framework is needed for understanding how health of animals changes over space and time.Through knowledge of individual health we can better understand the status of populations. This is particularly important in endangered species, where the consequences of disruption of critical biological functions can push groups of animals rapidly toward extinction. Here we built a state-space model that provides estimates of movement, health, and survival. We assimilated 30+ years of photographic evidence of body condition and three additional visual health parameters in individual North Atlantic right whales, together with survey data, to infer the true health status as it changes over space and time. We also included the effect of reproductive status and entanglement status on health. At the population level, we estimated differential movement patterns in males and females. At the individual level, we estimated the likely animal locations each month. We estimated the relationship between observed and latent health status. Observations of body condition, skin condition, cyamid infestation on the blowholes, and rake marks all provided measures of the true underlying health. The resulting time series of individual health highlight both normal variations in health status and how anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and, ultimately, the survival of individuals. This modeling approach provides information for monitoring of health in right whales, as well as a framework for integrating observational data at the level of individuals up through the health status of the population. This framework can be broadly applied to a variety of systems - terrestrial and marine - where sporadic observations of individuals exist. © 2013 Schick et al.",,"animal health; article; Atlantic Ocean; Bayes theorem; body constitution; ectoparasitosis; endangered species; health status; hierarchical Bayes; mathematical model; population movement pattern; reproduction; sex difference; skin; survival; whale; animal; Bayes theorem; Crustacea; endangered species; environment; female; longevity; male; parasitology; physiology; population dynamics; population migration; statistics and numerical data; veterinary; whale; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cyamida; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Animal Migration; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Bayes Theorem; Crustacea; Ectoparasitic Infestations; Endangered Species; Environment; Female; Longevity; Male; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Whales",,,,,,,,"Clutton-Brock, T., Sheldon, B.C., Individuals and populations: the role of long-term, individual-based studies of animals in ecology and evolutionary biology (2010) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 25, pp. 562-573; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Guinness, F.E., Albon, S.D., (1982) Red deer: Behavior and ecology of two sexes, , University of Chicago Press; Bestley, S., Patterson, T.A., Hindell, M.A., Gunn, J.S., Predicting feeding success in a migratory predator: integrating telemetry, environment, and modeling techniques (2010) Ecology, 91, pp. 2373-2384; Robinson, P.W., Simmons, S.E., Crocker, D.E., Costa, D.P., Measurements of foraging success in a highly pelagic marine predator, the northern elephant seal (2010) The Journal of animal ecology, 79, pp. 1146-1156. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20673236, Available:.

We investigated the physical and biological oceanographic characteristics that make this margin a lucrative feeding ground. Bottom-moored acoustic Doppler current profilers equipped with conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors were deployed cross-isobath on the southeastern slope of the basin to simultaneously measure variation in Calanus spp. concentration, current velocity, and water mass characteristics in time and space. Variation in upslope tidal advection of deep-basin water with densities &gt;1026 kg m-3 and containing highly concentrated copepod aggregations was the most important process influencing cross-isobath variation in copepod concentrations on the slope. The aggregations were maintained in the slope region through time despite extensive along-isobath advection, implying the existence of copepod re-supply mechanisms to the southern margin. Proposed mechanisms include immigration from surface populations, horizontal advection, and gyrelike re-circulation within the basin. A simple empirically-driven particle tracking model illustrated tidally-forced particle convergence between the 100 and 140 m isobaths on the southeastern slope, followed by upward and along-isobath advection. Cross-isobath 'compression' of copepods coupled with the maintenance of their vertical position through neutral buoyancy is proposed as a mechanism resulting in accumulation on the slope, making the area uniquely beneficial to right whales feeding at depth along the slope margin. © Inter-Research 2013.","Acoustic Doppler current profiler; Calanus; Right whale; Roseway Basin; Sloped margin; Tides; Water mass density","Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler; advection; buoyancy; coastal zone; continental shelf; crustacean; current velocity; diapause; feeding ground; immigration; spatial variation; subtidal environment; tidal current; vertical distribution; water mass; whale; Canada; Nova Scotia; Balaenidae; Calanus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aretxabaleta, A.L., McGillicuddy Jr., D.J., Smith, K.W., Lynch, D.R., Model simulations of the Bay of Fundy gyre. 1.

In late 2008, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued mandatory time-area vessel speed restrictions along the U.S. eastern seaboard in an effort to mediate collision-related mortality of right whales. All vessels 65 feet and greater in length are restricted to speeds of 10 knots or less during seasonally implemented regulatory periods. We modeled mortality risk of North Atlantic right whale when the vessel restrictions were and were not in effect, including (1) estimation of the probability of lethal injury given a ship strike as a function of vessel speed, (2) estimation of the effect of transit speed on the instantaneous rate of ship strikes, and (3) a consideration of total risk reduction. Logistic regression and Bayesian probit analyses indicated a significant positive relationship between ship speed and the probability of a lethal injury. We found that speeds of vessels that struck whales were consistently greater than typical vessel speeds for each vessel type and regulatory period studied; a use-availability model fit to these data provided strong evidence for a linear effect of transit speed on strike rates. Overall, we estimated that vessel speed restrictions reduced total ship strike mortality risk levels by 80-90% with levels that were closer to 90% in the latter two of the four active vessel speed restriction periods studied. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assessment to date of the utility of vessel speed restrictions in reducing the threat of vessel collisions to large whales. Our findings indicate that vessel speed limits are a powerful tool for reducing anthropogenic mortality risk for North Atlantic right whales.

It was found dead 11 d after the tag ceased transmission. Chronic constrictive deep rope lacerations and emaciation were found to be the proximate cause of death, which may have ultimately involved shark predation. A broadhead cutter and a spring-loaded knife used for disentanglement were found to induce moderate wounds to the skin and blubber. The telemetry tag, with two barbed shafts partially penetrating the blubber was shed, leaving barbs embedded with localized histological reaction. One of four darts administered shed the barrel, but the needle was found postmortem in the whale with an 80o bend at the blubber-muscle interface. This bend occurred due to epaxial muscle movement relative to the overlying blubber, with resultant necrosis and cavitation of underlying muscle. This suggests that rigid, implanted devices that span the cetacean blubber muscle interface, where the muscle moves relative to the blubber, could have secondary health impacts. Thus we encourage efforts to develop new tag telemetry systems that do not penetrate the subdermal sheath, but still remain attached for many months. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Right whale; Shark predation; Tag; Trauma","biotelemetry; histology; lesion; monitoring; mortality; movement; muscle; predation; satellite imagery; shark; tagging; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Andrews, R., Pitman, R., Ballance, L., Satellite tracking reveals distinct movement patterns for Type B and Type C killer whales in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica (2008) Polar Biology, 31, pp. 1461-1468; Best, P., Mate, B., Sighting history and observations of southern right whales off South Africa (2007) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 9, pp. 111-114; Cassoff, R.M., Moore, K.M., McLellan, W.A., Barco, S.G., Rotstein, D.S., Moore, M.J., Lethal entanglement in baleen whales (2011) Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 96, pp. 175-185; Fraser, D., Weary, D.M., Pajor, E.A., Milligan, B.N., A scientific conception of animal welfare that reflects ethical concerns (1997) Animal Welfare, 6, pp. 187-205; Geraci, J.R., Smith, G.J.D., Cutaneous response to implants, tags, and marks in beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, and bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus.

However, recovery may also be limited because individuals are under nutritional stress. We quantified the food requirements of North Atlantic right whales by age, sex and reproductive state and compared their predicted needs with field estimates of prey consumption to assess whether any demographic group of right whales might be nutritionally stressed. Energy requirements were estimated using a bioener - getics model that accounted for uncertainty in energy inputs and outputs. Consumption was estimated with prey samples taken near feeding whales in Cape Cod Bay (n = 28 net collections) and the Bay of Fundy (n = 19 optical plankton recordings). We found that calves required the least energy (~1767 MJ d-1) and that lactating females required the most (~4120 MJ d -1). Juveniles required considerably more energy than adult males and non-reproductive females. Our estimates of energy requirements for juveniles (~1906 MJ d-1), adult males (~1793 MJ d-1), and nonreproductive females (~2104 MJ d-1) compared favorably with estimates of actual consumption in Cape Cod Bay and the Bay of Fundy (i.e. they differed by ≤15%), suggesting that our model was reliable. However, lactating females appear to have obtained considerably less than their predicted energy requirements in both habitats. These findings suggest that lactating females may be experiencing an energy deficit, which may affect reproductive rates and slow population recovery. Nutritional stress may thus be limiting the recovery of North Atlantic right whales. © Inter-Research 2013.","Bioenergetic model; Calving rate; Energetic consumption; Eubalaena glacialis; Nutritional stress; Reproductive interval","bioenergetics; consumption behavior; energy use; estimation method; juvenile; nutritional status; species conservation; species occurrence; uncertainty analysis; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C.S., Wishner, K.F., Macaulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Berkson, J.M., Kline, L.L., Orth, D.J., Evolving methodologies: From creation to application (2002) Incorporating Uncertainty into Fishery Models, , eds, Bethesda, MD, American Fisheries Society; Best, P.B., Brandão, A., Buttersworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, (2), pp. 161-169. , Spec Issue; Blueweiss, L., Fox, H., Kudzma, V., Nakashima, D., Peters, R., Sams, S., Relationships between body size and some life history parameters (1978) Oecologia, 37, pp. 257-272; Brody, S., (1945) Bioenergetics and Growth, , Hafner Press, New York, NY; Brody, S., (1968) Bioenergetics and Growth, , revised 1945 edn.

These waters are included within the designated critical habitat for right whales. Data on swim speed, behavior, and direction of movement - with photo-identification of individual whales - were gathered by a volunteer sighting network working alongside experienced scientists and supplemented by aerial observations. In seven years (2001-2007), 109 tracking periods or ""follows"" were conducted on right whales during 600 hours of observation from shore-based observers. The whales were categorized as mother-calf pairs, singles and non-mother-calf pairs, and groups of 3 or more individuals. Sample size and amount of information obtained was largest for mother-calf pairs. Swim speeds varied within and across observation periods, individuals, and categories. One category, singles and non mother-calf pairs, was significantly different from the other two - and had the largest variability and the fastest swim speeds. Median swim speed for all categories was 1.3 km/h (0.7 kn), with examples that suggest swim speeds differ between within-habitat movement and migration-mode travel. Within-habitat right whales often travel back-and-forth in a north-south, along-coast, direction, which may cause an individual to pass by a given point on several occasions, potentially increasing anthropogenic risk exposure (e.g., vessel collision, fishing gear entanglement, harassment). At times, mothers and calves engaged in lengthy stationary periods (up to 7.5 h) that included rest, nursing, and play. These mother-calf interactions have implications for communication, learning, and survival. Overall, these behaviors are relevant to population status, distribution, calving success, correlation to environmental parameters, survey efficacy, and human-impacts mitigation. These observations contribute important parameters to conservation biology, predictive modeling, and management. However, while we often search for predictions, patterns, and means, the message here is also about variability and the behavioral characteristics of individual whales. © 2013 Hain et al.",,"animal behavior; animal communication; animal identification; article; calf (mammal); classification; coastal waters; Eubalaena glacialis; habitat; information system; learning; mother; mother child relation; nonhuman; population biology; population movement pattern; sample size; scientist; survival; swimming; travel; United States; whale; Animal Migration; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Environment; Florida; Humans; Swimming; Whales; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Moore, J.C., Distribution of marine mammals to Florida waters (1953) American Midland Naturalist, 49, pp. 117-158; Layne, J.N., Observations on marine mammals in Florida waters (1965) Bulletin of the Florida State Museum, 9, pp. 132-181; Caldwell, D.K., Golley, F.B., Marine mammals from the coast of Georgia to Cape Hatteras (1965) Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Society, 81, pp. 24-32; Caldwell, D.K., Caldwell, M.C., (1972) The World of the Bottlenosed Dolphin, p. 157. , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: J.B.

Adequate protection of right whales in the face of plans to develop offshore renewable energy requires more information about this species' distribution and occurrence in this region. We present findings from the first year-round study dedicated to marine mammals in New Jersey's nearshore waters using line transect surveys and passive acoustic monitoring. Four groups of right whales, including a cow-calf pair, were sighted. Right whales were detected acoustically during all seasons. Sightings of females and subsequent confirmations of these same individuals in the calving grounds a month or less later illustrate that these waters are part of this species' migratory corridor. Observations of skim-feeding behavior suggest that feeding may also occur in areas farther south than the main feeding grounds. Based on the year-round occurrence of right whales offNew Jersey, we recommend that presumed seasonal migratory patterns not be used alone to determine the timing of construction activities or monitoring/mitigation efforts for offshore development. Our results also provide support for the expansion of existing critical habitat to include nearshore waters of the mid-Atlantic. © Inter-Research 2013.","Conservation; Distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic right whale; Passive acoustic monitoring; Seasonality; Surveys","Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: #10014",,,"Barlow, J., Trackline detection probability for long-diving whales (1999) Marine mammal survey and assessment methods, pp. 209-221. , In: Garner GW, Amstrup SC, Laake JL, Manly BFJ and others (eds) Balkema Press, Rotterdam; Biedron, I., Mihnovets, N., Warde, A., Michalec, J., (2009) Determining the seasonal distribution of cetaceans in New York coastal waters using passive acoustic monitoring, p. 34. , Abstracts of 18th Bienn Conf Biol Mar Mamm, Québec City, 12-16 Oct 2009; Bowman, R., Lyman, E., Mattila, D., Mayo, C., Brown, M., (2001) Habitat management lessons from a satellite-tracked right whale, p. 31. , Abstracts of 14th Bienn Conf Biol Mar Mamm, Van couver, 28 Nov-3 Dec 2001; Brown, S.G., Twentieth-century records of right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (1986) Rep Int Whal Comm, 10, pp. 121-127; Brown, M.W., Brault, S., Hamilton, P.K., Kenney, R.D., Sighting heterogeneity of right whales in the western North Atlantic: 1980-1992 (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, pp. 245-250; Buckland, S.T., Shipboard sighting surveys: methodological developments to meet practical needs (2001) Bull Int Stat Inst, 53rd Session Proc, Book, 1, pp. 315-318; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Characterization of marine mammals and turtles in the Mid- and North Atlantic areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (1982) Final report of the CETAP, , Contract AA551-CT8-48, for the US Bureau of Land Management, Washington, DC.

Here, we show that the energy and lipid content of C5 C. finmarchicus collected twice monthly (July to September) from the Grand Manan Basin exhibited significant variation over multiple years (2006 to 2010). Mean ± SD wet mass energy (6.77 ± 0.65 kJ g-1) was highest in 2007 and lowest in 2009 (5.82 ± 0.90 kJ g-1); lipid content followed the same pattern. Significant decreases in individual energy content were observed over the summer during 2006 and 2010. Lipid content was significantly correlated with energy content. Overall, energy content of copepods was 13% lower in 2009 than in 2006-2007, which could alter foraging patterns and activity budgets of predators such as the North Atlantic right whale and have implications for assessment of whale habitat based on models of energy requirements. Variation in C5 quality may be linked to annual changes in the lipid content of Bay of Fundy herring, which consume copepods and are in turn a main prey item of seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. Our study emphasizes that variation in quality, not just quantity, of prey should be considered when formulating predator consumption models and in tracking trophic transfer. © Inter-Research 2013.","Bay of fundy; Energy content; Eubalaena glacialis; Food web; Lipid; Prey quality; Zooplankton","Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Abraham, C.L., Sydeman, W.J., Ocean climate, euphausiids and auklet nesting: interannual trends and variation in phenology, diet and growth of a planktivorous seabird, Ptychoramphus aleuticus (2004) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 274, pp. 235-250; Ainley, D.G., Ballard, G., Dugger, K.M., Competition among penguins and cetaceans reveals trophic cascades in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 2080-2093; Anthony, J.A., Roby, D.D., Turco, K.R., Lipid content and energy density of forage fishes from the northern Gulf of Alaska (2000) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 248, pp. 53-78; Bakke, J.L.W., Valderhaug, V.A., Ecological studies on the deep-water pelagic community of Korsfjorden, western Norway Population biology, biomass and calorie content of Chiridius armatus (Crustacea, Copepoda).

The system, called DeLMA is based on integrating advanced machine learning with high performance computing (HPC). The goal of this work is to provide the capability to accurately detect and classify whale sounds in large acoustics datasets collected using underwater sensors. The case study for this work is focused on detecting the acoustic communication signals of the North Atlantic Right Whale, <ce:italic>Eubalaena glacialis</ce:italic>, and uses data collected in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. A summary of the work done for developing a complex detection-classification system and brief description of several algorithms that are used for classifying whale sounds will be covered. A brief discussion on how standard detection algorithms can be incorporated, with no special modifications, into the HPC system for analysis will be mentioned, and two new right whale detection methods are presented, based on continuous region analysis (CRA) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). This paper presents a first-hand look at applying the DeLMA system and these algorithms on a large dataset containing over 60,000 channel-hours of acoustic data from the SBNMS. Results from these new detection methods are compared against Baseline algorithms. With the development of the DeLMA system, sound archives can now be explored using a powerful distributed processing architecture. This advancement will allow for rapid execution and visualization of the data using seasonal graphs called diel plots, which show the distribution of detections on a time-of-day vs. time-of-year plane. Diel plots of Baseline, CRA and HOG algorithm results reveal various large-scale features of the seasonality of whale calling behavior. Results are summarized and the authors discuss future areas for study, especially those relate to handling other big passive acoustic data projects. © 2013 The Authors.

The whale was sighted in the Azores on 5 January 2009 travelling in a west-south westerly direction at a constant speed. A photographic match was found to an adult female in the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue. The whale's previous last sighting, on 24 September 2008 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, implies movement to the Azores of at least 3,320km in 101 days. It was subsequently resighted in the Bay of Fundy on 2 September 2009, 237 days after being seen in the Azores. This appears to be the only documented evidence of a western North Atlantic right whale outside its normal range in winter, and provides additional evidence of the potential for interbreeding between western North Atlantic right whales and the remnant eastern population.","Atlantic ocean; Distribution; Europe; Management; Movements; North atlantic right whale; Northern hemisphere; Stock identity","habitat management; movement; Northern Hemisphere; photograph; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; stock identification; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Azores; Bay of Fundy; Portugal; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

We sought to further develop methods of quantifying the effects of communication masking associated with human-induced sound on contact-calling North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in an ecologically relevant area (∼10,000 km2) and time period (peak feeding time). We used an array of temporary, bottom-mounted, autonomous acoustic recorders in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary to monitor ambient noise levels, measure levels of sound associated with vessels, and detect and locate calling whales. We related wind speed, as recorded by regional oceanographic buoys, to ambient noise levels. We used vessel-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System to quantify acoustic signatures of large commercial vessels. On the basis of these integrated sound fields, median signal excess (the difference between the signal-to-noise ratio and the assumed recognition differential) for contact-calling right whales was negative (-1 dB) under current ambient noise levels and was further reduced (-2 dB) by the addition of noise from ships. Compared with potential communication space available under historically lower noise conditions, calling right whales may have lost, on average, 63-67% of their communication space. One or more of the 89 calling whales in the study area was exposed to noise levels ≥120 dB re 1 μPa by ships for 20% of the month, and a maximum of 11 whales were exposed to noise at or above this level during a single 10-min period. These results highlight the limitations of exposure-threshold (i.e., dose-response) metrics for assessing chronic anthropogenic noise effects on communication opportunities. Our methods can be used to integrate chronic and wide-ranging noise effects in emerging ocean-planning forums that seek to improve management of cumulative effects of noise on marine species and their habitats. ©2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Endangered species; Marine protected area; Marine spatial planning; Underwater noise","ambient noise; anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; communication behavior; ecological impact; endangered species; environmental disturbance; marine park; pollution exposure; signal-to-noise ratio; spatial planning; underwater noise; whale; wind velocity; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; environmental protection; noise; physiology; sea; season; ship; United States; vocalization; whale; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Conservation of Natural Resources; Massachusetts; Noise; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Ships; Vocalization, Animal; Whales; Massachusetts; Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; United States; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Ocean ambient sound: comparing the 1960s with the 1990s for a receiver off the California coast (2002) Acoustic Research Letters Online, 3, pp. 65-70; Babisch, W., (2006) Transportation noise and cardiovascular risk: review and synthesis of epidemiological studies, dose-effect curve and risk estimation, , Umweltbundesamt, Berlin; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Hatch, L.T., Van Parijs, S.M., Frankel, A., Ponirakis, D., Acoustic masking in marine ecosystems: intuitions, analysis, and implications (2009) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 395, pp. 201-222; Ehler, C., Douvere, F., (2009) Marine spatial planning: a step-by-step approach toward ecosystem-based management, , Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and Man and the Biosphere Programme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris; Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Clark, C.W., Frankel, A.S., A new context-based approach to assess marine mammal behavioral responses to anthropogenic sounds (2012) Conservation Biology, 26, pp. 21-28; Evans, G.W., A multimethodological analysis of cumulative risk and allostatic load among rural children (2003) Developmental Psychology, 39, pp. 924-933; Foley, M.M., Guiding ecological principles for marine spatial planning (2010) Marine Policy, 34, pp. 955-966; Frankel, A.S., Ellison, W.T., Buchanan, J., Application of the acoustic integration model (AIM) to predict and minimize environmental impacts (2002) IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 28, pp. 3-12; Halpern, B.S., A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems (2008) Science, 319, pp. 948-952; Haralabidis, A.S., Acute effects of night-time noise exposure on blood pressure in populations living near airports (2008) European Heart Journal, 29, pp. 658-664; Hatch, L.T., Clark, C.W., Merrick, R., Van Parijs, S.M., Ponirakis, D., Schwehr, K., Thompson, M., Wiley, D., Characterizing the relative contributions of large vessels to total ocean noise fields: a case study using the Gerry E.

During the 60 days of monthly surveys, we recorded over 2.6×106 records of data with ship position information. There were 1181 hours of AIS and 540 hours of RADAR data collected for a monthly mean of 98 and 45 hours for AIS and RADAR respectively. These data represented 1411 transits by vessels broadcasting AIS for a total of 69,606km of track line, and vessels acquired with RADAR represented a total of 506 transits for a total of 8,702km of track line. AIS and RADAR data resulted in 1.2 and 0.9 transits per hour respectively. We corrected the AIS data to match RADAR effort, and, when effort was equal, AIS data represented only 49.7% of the total large vessel transits observed, and transits per hour were equal for corrected AIS and RADAR data. We recorded more inbound vessels using AIS and more outbound vessels with RADAR. The density pattern of vessels recorded using AIS differed from the RADAR pattern. There was a very discrete pattern for vessels broadcasting an AIS signal that corresponded with the shipping lane buoys. Vessels recorded using RADAR, on the other hand, were more dispersed and displayed a less discrete pattern covering a large area outside of the ship buoys. Winter was the season with the fewest vessel transits for both data collection methods (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), though there was not a substantial decrease over other seasons in the AIS data. Spring, summer and fall were similar for AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% respectively), but fall (31.4%) had considerably more vessels recorded by RADAR than spring and summer (26.5%, 25.1% respectively). When examining vessel type data, more than two thirds of the vessel transits recorded using AIS were cargo vessels (68%; n=337). Excluding unknown vessels, military vessels made up 47% (n=179) of the vessels we identified with RADAR, followed by fishing (32%; n=120) and federal law enforcement (USCG) vessels (10%, n=38). Spatial analysis was necessary to accurately evaluate ship speed over the entire study area. Spatial analyses of these data allowed us to examine speed behavior in a grid format, reducing the effect of directional bias from an overrepresentation of records from relatively slow moving vessels. Without utilizing spatial analysis, one could draw the conclusion that vessels were transiting the area more slowly than they actually were because AIS speed records are skewed by the greater number of speed points for slower vessels. There was an obvious reduction in speed of vessels transmitting AIS in the shipping lanes from before to after the Ship Strike Rule that was enacted in December 2008 to protect the western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The Ship Strike Rule identified a Seasonal Management Area (SMA) within which commercial ships ≥65 ft. in length were required to slow to 10kts or less for part of the year (50 CFR224.105). Although vessels slowed, many were not in compliance with the mandatory speed limit of the Rule. Speed restrictions had no effect on vessels observed using RADAR, most of which were not required to comply with the regulations. Cargo ships can be quite large and travel at speeds in excess of 20kt, and were required to broadcast AIS signals, so their behavior was relatively easy to assess. Few cargo vessels traveled 10kt or less for an entire transit through the SMA. Thus, we observed an apparent reaction to the speed restrictions in the SMA, but did not observe strict compliance. Recently the US Coast Guard has begun issuing speeding citations to vessels that have been recorded blatantly disregarding the speed restrictions in SMAs. We applaud these efforts and suspect that if the effort continues consistently it will encourage compliance. Our data suggest that AIS traffic levels were relatively constant (∼1.2 transits/hr) around the clock. For this project, we chose to operate the RADAR unit during daylight hours in order to assess vessel type and approximate length from the shore-based platform. In the future, we need to assess RADAR vessel traffic during all hours in order to better compare it to AIS traffic. In 2007, Virginia ports were listed as the third busiest port on the U.S. Atlantic coast for vessel calls. A large portion of the vessels calls for the port of Baltimore also enter at Chesapeake Bay. The addition of commercial Baltimore traffic as well as federal and fishing vessels not broadcasting AIS very likely makes the Chesapeake Bay approach one of the two busiest coastal port approaches and may make it the busiest in the western North Atlantic. This project raises numerous questions about vessel traffic patterns, vessel speeds, risks to whales and data incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts. There is a definite need for both longer-reaching ship RADAR data and more detailed whale presence data in the mid-Atlantic region, especially off its busiest port. Without data on whale presence, it is nearly impossible to answer questions about the level of risk that the vessel traffic patterns present for whales and on how installations of offshore wind and other energy ventures may affect whales and ships. This project brings into question the use of AIS data alone as an accurate representation of large vessel traffic in coastal regions of the United States, especially in areas with high fishing and military traffic. In Virginia, during daylight hours, AIS data represent a maximum of two thirds, and, as little as one half, of the large vessel (&gt;65 feet) traffic in the Chesapeake Bay approach. Further research is needed to address the accurate determination of vessel size when using RADAR. A mobile research platform with the capability of assessing RADAR targets on the water or an offshore platform with a greater range and use of night vision technology may provide solutions. © 2012 IEEE.","AIS; Chesapeake Bay; Hampton Roads; RADAR; Right Whale Seasonal Management Area; ship traffic; Shipping; Virginia","AIS; Chesapeake Bay; Hampton; Management areas; Ship traffic; Virginia; Broadcasting; Buoys; Drilling platforms; Fisheries; Freight transportation; Highway administration; Laws and legislation; Oceanography; Offshore structures; Radar; Ships; Softwoods; Speed; Traffic signals; Waterway transportation; Fishing vessels",,,,,,,,"(2008) Vessel Calls at US Ports Snapshot, 2007, , USDOT.

To investigate this issue further, all available photographs of right whales taken from 1980 to 2009 were examined for evidence of entanglement with gear used in fisheries based on presence of rope or netting on the whale or scars inferred to have been caused by an encounter with rope. Photographs of 626 individual whales were assessed and 1032 unique entanglement events were documented. Of the 626 animals, 519 (82.9%) had been entangled at least once and 306 of the 519 (59.0%) had been entangled more than once. Males and females were entangled at similar rates. Juveniles were entangled at a higher rate than adults. On average, 25.9% of adequately photographed animals acquired new wounds or scars from fishing gear annually with no significant trend over time detected. However, the annual percentage of animals observed with rope on the body increased significantly during the study period, suggesting that it is becoming more difficult for whales to free themselves completely from fishing gear. Such high annual rates of entanglement remain a serious conservation concern for right whales because entanglements can have both lethal and sub-lethal effects. Federally required changes to fixed-gear fisheries in US waters have not reduced serious injuries and mortality to legally required levels. Here we show how documenting various annual rates of entanglement can monitor progress and impacts that fishing gear regulations may have on right whale recovery. © Inter-Research 2012.","Conservation; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Fishing gear; North Atlantic right whale; Scars","cause of death; ecological impact; fishing gear; injury; juvenile; monitoring; nature-society relations; photograph; species conservation; whale; wounding; United States",,,,,,,,"Anderson, M.S., Forney, K.A., Cole, T.V., Eagle, T., (2008) Differentiating serious and non-serious injury of marine mammals: report of the serious injury technical workshop, 10-13 Sep 2007, , Seattle, Washington, DC.

Body lengths from 154 individuals revealed that calves more than doubled in size and attained three-fourths of asymptotic adult size by the time they had weaned at 12 months. Calves gained on average ∼1.7 cm and ∼34 kg per day while nursing during this extremely rapid growth phase. Mean predicted lengths and body mass were 4.2 m and 1.1 metric tons (mt) at birth, 10.3 m and 13.5 mt at weaning, and 13.6 m and 29.6 mt when fully grown. Growth of right whales was best described using a 2-phased Gompertz growth model and could not be fit using any of the single continuous growth models commonly used for other mammals. Rapid growth during dependency may minimize the risk of predation and maximize calf survival. Rapid calf growth also may maximize development of the mouth and baleen to optimize foraging efficiency of juveniles at the time of weaning, as well as improve reproductive fitness by reducing the age at which sexual maturity is attained. However, transferring the amount of energy needed to support the rapid postnatal growth of North Atlantic right whales may ultimately affect the intervals between pregnancies (>3 years) of mature females. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.","Eubalaena glacialis; growth models; length; mass; reproductive costs; right whale","adult; bioenergetics; body mass; body size; endangered species; fitness; growth modeling; growth rate; juvenile; life history trait; nutritional requirement; optimum foraging theory; predation risk; pregnancy; reproductive cost; sexual maturity; survival; weaning; whale",,,,,,,,"Agusa, T., Et Al., Accumulation features of trace elements in mass-stranded harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the North Sea coast in 2002: The body distribution and association with growth and nutrition status (2011) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 62, pp. 963-975; Arendt, J.D., Adaptive intrinsic growth rates: An integration across taxa (1997) Quarterly Review of Biology, 72, pp. 149-177; Armfield, B.A., George, J.C., Vinyard, C.J., Thewissen, J.G.M., Allometric patterns of fetal head growth in mysticetes and odontocetes: Comparison of Balaena mysticetus and Stenella attenuata (2011) Marine Mammal Science, 27, pp. 819-827; Barkman, R.C., Bengtson, D.A., The record of daily growth in otoliths of Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia, from field and laboratory (1987) Journal of Fish Biology, 31, pp. 683-695; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 137-154; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Beamish, P.B., McFarlane, G.A., The forgotten requirement for age validation in fisheries biology (1983) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 112, pp. 735-743; Best, P.B., Ruther, H., Aerial photogrammetry of southern right whales, Eubalaena australis (1992) Journal of Zoology (London), 228, pp. 595-614; Blanckenhorn, W.U., The evolution of body size: What keeps organisms small?

Although over 40 value estimates exist, it is often difficult to compare values from different studies due to variations in study design, implementation, and modeling specifications. We conducted a stated-preference choice experiment to estimate the value of recovering or downlisting 8 threatened and endangered marine species in the United States: loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), upper Willamette River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi), and smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). In May 2009, we surveyed a random sample of U.S. households. We collected data from 8476 households and estimated willingness to pay for recovering and downlisting the 8 species from these data. Respondents were willing to pay for recovering and downlisting threatened and endangered marine taxa. Willingness-to-pay values ranged from $40/household for recovering Puget Sound Chinook salmon to $73/household for recovering the North Pacific right whale. Statistical comparisons among willingness-to-pay values suggest that some taxa are more economically valuable than others, which suggests that the U.S. public's willingness to pay for recovery may vary by species. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Choice experiment; Economics; Marine mammals; Nonmarket valuation; Threatened species; Willingness to pay","comparative study; contingent valuation; data acquisition; endangered species; environmental economics; experimental design; experimental study; household survey; marine environment; marine mammal; rare species; regeneration; teleost; turtle; willingness to pay; adult; animal; aquatic species; article; economics; endangered species; environmental protection; female; human; male; methodology; middle aged; public opinion; questionnaire; socioeconomics; species difference; United States; vertebrate; Adult; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; Questionnaires; Species Specificity; United States; Value of Life; Vertebrates; Young Adult; United States; Caretta; Caretta caretta; Cetacea; Dermochelyidae; Dermochelys coriacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Mammalia; Monachus schauinslandi; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Pristis pectinata; Testudines",,,,,,,,"Adamowicz, W., Louviere, J., Swait, J., (1998) Introduction to attribute-based stated choice methods, , Final report.

Box 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada","Vessel strikes are the primary source of known mortality for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Multi-institutional efforts to reduce mortality associated with vessel strikes include vessel-routing amendments such as the International Maritime Organization voluntary ""area to be avoided"" (ATBA) in the Roseway Basin right whale feeding habitat on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. Though relative probabilities of lethal vessel strikes have been estimated and published, absolute probabilities remain unknown. We used a modeling approach to determine the regional effect of the ATBA, by estimating reductions in the expected number of lethal vessel strikes. This analysis differs from others in that it explicitly includes a spatiotemporal analysis of real-time transits of vessels through a population of simulated, swimming right whales. Combining automatic identification system (AIS) vessel navigation data and an observationally based whale movement model allowed us to determine the spatial and temporal intersection of vessels and whales, from which various probability estimates of lethal vessel strikes are derived. We estimate one lethal vessel strike every 0.775-2.07 years prior to ATBA implementation, consistent with and more constrained than previous estimates of every 2-16 years. Following implementation, a lethal vessel strike is expected every 41 years. When whale abundance is held constant across years, we estimate that voluntary vessel compliance with the ATBA results in an 82% reduction in the per capita rate of lethal strikes; very similar to a previously published estimate of 82% reduction in the relative risk of a lethal vessel strike. The models we developed can inform decision-making and policy design, based on their ability to provide absolute, population-corrected, time-varying estimates of lethal vessel strikes, and they are easily transported to other regions and situations. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Absolute probability estimates; Endangered whales; Eubalaena glacialis; Marine area closure; Mortality reduction; North Atlantic right whale; Roseway Basin, Scotian Shelf; Vessel routing; Vessel strike","abundance; endangered species; marine park; mortality; population estimation; probability; swimming; whale; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; endangered species; injury; population density; ship; whale; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Endangered Species; Models, Biological; Population Density; Ships; Whales; Wounds and Injuries; Atlantic Ocean; Roseway Basin; Scotia Shelf; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 62, pp. 527-543; Bovet, P., Benhamou, S., Spatial analysis of animal's movements using a correlated random walk model (1988) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 131, pp. 419-433; Brown, M.W., Brault, S., Hamilton, P.K., Kenney, R.D., Knowlton, A.R., Marx, M.K., Mayo, C.A., Kraus, S.D., Sighting heterogeneity of right whales in the western North Atlantic: 1980-1992 (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2 (SPECIAL ISSUE), pp. 245-250; Brown, M.W., Cunha, J., Hamilton, P.K., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., (2010) Research, Monitoring and Conservation of the North Atlantic Right Whale in the Bay of Fundy and on Roseway Basin, Canada: 2009, , New England Aquarium, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Brown, M.W., Fenton, D., Smedbol, K., Merriman, C., Robichaud-Leblanc, K., Conway, J.D., (2009) Recovery Strategy for the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena Glacialis) in Atlantic Canadian Waters, , Species at Risk Act Recovery Strategy Series.

All management plans depend on knowing when and where right whales are likely to be present. We tested the feasibility of a system designed to predict potential right whale habitat on a weekly time scale. The system paired right whale occurrence records with a collection of data layers including: results from a coupled biological-physical model of Calanus finmarchicus (the primary prey of right whales), satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, and bathymetry. Using these data, we trained seasonal habitat models and projected them onto environmental data for each 8 d period from January to June, 2002 to 2006. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) that right whale environmental preferences change from season to season and (2) that modeled prey concentration is an important predictor of the distribution of right whales. To test H1, we trained, tested, and compared models for 3 time periods: winter, spring, and winter and spring combined. To test H2, we trained and tested models with and without C. finmarchicus. Predictions of habitat suitability were highly dynamic within and across years. Our results support the hypothesis that right whale environmental preferences change between winter and spring. The inclusion of modeled C. finmarchicus abundance improved the accuracy of habitat suitability predictions. © Inter-Research 2012.","Calanus finmarchicus; Eubalaena glacialis; Gulf of Maine; Right whale; Species distribution model; Transferability","conservation management; endangered species; fishing gear; habitat structure; hypothesis testing; injury; mortality; prediction; preference behavior; sea surface temperature; species conservation; species occurrence; temporal variation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C.S., Wishner, K.F., Macaulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Slay, C.K., Garrison, L.P., Surveying for discovery, science and management (2007), pp. 105-137. , Kraus SD, Rolland RM (eds) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads.

We developed a habitat model of the relationship between the winter distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, one of the most endangered large whales in the world, and environmental characteristics in its only identified calving ground, the waters off Florida and Georgia. Our objective was to provide a scientific basis for revising critical habitat boundaries in the southeastern USA (SEUS) and to predict potential habitat in the mid-Atlantic region north of the study area through a better understanding of the relationship of observed right whale distribution to environmental conditions. A long-term data set of right whale sightings from aerial surveys within the SEUS (conducted seasonally, December through March, from 1992/1993 to 2000/2001) was used in a generalized additive model to eval u -ate right whale distribution in relation to sea surface temperature, bathymetry, wind data, and several spatial variables. Model results indicated that sea surface temperature and water depth were significant predictors of calving right whale spatial distribution. The habitat relationships were unimodal, with peak sighting rates occurring at water temperatures of 13 to 15 oC and water depths of 10 to 20 m. Model results indicated areas of potentially important calving habitat outside currently defined critical habitat. Our semi-monthly predicted distributions, based on model results, provide managers with a range of scientifically based choices for revising critical habitat boundaries to achieve the desired level of protection. Predictions extrapolated through the mid-Atlantic suggested appropriate habitat features north of the study site, although analysis of data from more recent surveys in this region would be required to validate model results. © Inter-Research 2012.","Critical habitat; Eubalaena glacialis; Gam; Generalized additive model; Geographic information system; Gis; PCE; Primary constituent element; Spatially-explicit model","bathymetry; endangered species; environmental conditions; GIS; habitat; numerical model; spatial variation; surface temperature; whale; United States",,,,,,,,"Austin, M.P., Spatial prediction of species distribution, an interface between ecological theory and statistical modelling (2002) Ecol Model, 157, pp. 101-118; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Brown, C.W., Winn, H.E., Relationship between the distribution pattern of right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, and satellite-derived sea surface thermal structure in the Great South Channel (1989) Cont Shelf Res, 9, pp. 247-260; Corkeron, P.J., Connor, R.C., Why do baleen whales migrate?

no diel pattern was apparent in other monthsThe spatial distribution of the approximate locations of calling whales suggests they may use Massachusetts Bay as a conduit to Cape Cod Bay in the spring and as they move between the Gulf of Maine and waters to the south in September through DecemberAlthough it is unclear how dependent right whales are on the bay, the discovery of their widespread presence in Massachusetts Bay throughout the year suggests this region may need to be managed to reduce the probability of collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Cetacean;

Aerial photogrammetry was used to measure dorsal body width at multiple locations along the bodies of free-swimming right whales at different stages of the female reproductive cycle (E. glacialis) and during the initial months of lactation (mother and calf Eubalaena australis) to quantify changes in nutritional condition during energetically demanding events. Principal components analyses indicated that body width was most variable at 60% of the body length from the snout. Thoracic, abdominal and caudal body width of E. australis thinned significantly during the initial months of lactation, especially at 60% of body length from the snout, while their calves' widths and widthto- length ratios increased. The body shape of E. glacialis that had been lactating for 8 mo was significantly thinner than non-lactating, non-pregnant E. glacialis. Body shape of E. glacialis measured in the eighth month of lactation was significantly thinner than that of E. australis in the first month, but did not differ from that of E. australis in the third and fourth months. Body width was comparable with diameter calculated from girth of carcasses. These results indicate that mother right whales rely on endogenous nutrient reserves to support the considerable energy expenditure during the initial months of lactation; therefore, photogrammetric measurements of body width, particularly at 60% of body length from the snout, are an effective way to quantitatively and remotely assess nutritional condition of living right whales. © Inter-Research 2012.","Aerial photogrammetry;

The evolutionary relationships of balaenids are poorly known, with the number of genera, relationships to fossil taxa, and position within Mysticeti in contention. This study employs a comprehensive set of morphological characters to address aspects of balaenid phylogeny. A sister-group relationship between neobalaenids and balaenids is strongly supported, although this conflicts with molecular evidence, which may be an artifact of long-branch attraction (LBA). Monophyly of Balaenidae is supported, and three major clades are recognized: (1) extinct genus Balaenula, (2) extant and extinct species of the genus Eubalaena, and (3) extant and extinct species of the genus Balaena plus the extinct taxon, Balaenella. The relationships of these clades to one another, as well as to the early Miocene stem balaenid, Morenocetus parvus, remain unresolved. Pliocene taxa, Balaenula astensis and Balaenula balaenopsis, form a clade that is the sister group to the Japanese Pliocene Balaenula sp. Eubalaena glacialis and Pliocene Eubalaena belgica, are in an unresolved polytomy with a clade including E. japonica and E. australis. Extant and fossil species of Balaena form a monophyletic group that is sister group to the Dutch Pliocene Balaenella, although phylogenetic relationships within Balaena remain unresolved. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenidae; Fossil whales; Mysticeti; Right whales; Whale evolution; Whale taxonomy","cladistics; fossil record; functional morphology; molecular analysis; Neogene; phylogeny; taxonomy; whale; Balaena; Balaenidae; Belgica; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Mysticeti; Neobalaenidae",,,,,,,,"Abel, O., Vorläufige mitteilungen uber die revision der fossilen mystacoceten aus dem tertiär belgiens (1941) Bulletin du Musée d'Histoire naturelle de Belgique, 17, pp. 1-29; Allen, J.A., The North Atlantic right whale and its near allies (1908) Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 24, pp. 277-329; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationships of baleen whales established by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Árnason, U., Ledje, C., The use of highly repetitive DNA for resolving cetacean and pinniped phylogenies (1992) Mammal phylogeny: Placentals, pp. 74-80. , Pages - in F.

The primary human-caused threats are entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with vessels. Since 2002, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has implemented both seasonally and dynamically managed protective zones where right whales occur to reduce these threats; Seasonal Area Management (SAM) and Dynamic Area Management (DAM) for the reduction of right whale entanglements with fishing gear, and Seasonal Management Areas (SMA) and Dynamic Management Areas (DMA) for reduction of vessel collisions. This paper analyzes the presence of frequent concentrations of right whales outside of SAM and SMA zones, represented by the spatial and temporal occurrence of DAMs and DMAs. A grid of 1 min×1 min squares was geospatially applied to locations of DAMs and DMAs from April 2002 through June 2011 and the number of management areas that intersected each 1 min square was populated. DAMs and DMAs were most highly concentrated along the central Gulf of Maine. Of the 131 DAMs and DMAs implemented, 97 (74.0%) intersected this area, and were primarily implemented from October through February. The results of this analysis will aid in consideration of possible modifications to the size and location of SMAs along the northern Atlantic coast of the U.S. and other management actions for the reduction of vessel collisions with right whales. © 2012.","GIS spatial analysis; Marine policy; North Atlantic right whale; Ship speed restrictions; Ship strike prevention","fishery management; fishing gear; GIS; marine policy; ship motion; spatial analysis; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Maine; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Kraus, S.D., Rolland, R.M., Right whales in the urban ocean (2007) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, S.D.

Year-round data on animal presence are critical to managing ship strike mortality. Marine autonomous recording units were deployed throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS, Massachusetts Bay, USA) for 13 mo from January 2006 to February 2007 and on Jeffreys Ledge (JL, Gulf of Maine, USA) for 7 mo from November 2004 to May 2005 to determine whether passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can improve information on right whale occurrence. Automated detection and manual review were used to determine presence and absence of right whale up-calls. In SBNMS, up-calls were detected year round, except during July and August, and calling rates were highest from January through May, peaking in April. In JL, up-calls occurred throughout all recording months, with the highest numbers from November through February. Up-calls were heard extensively in the wintertime throughout SBNMS and JL, suggesting that these areas are important overwintering grounds for right whales. Additionally, up-calls showed a strong diel trend in both areas, with significantly more calls occurring during twilight than dark and light periods. These data indicate that right whales are present more often and over longer time periods in the western Gulf of Maine than previously thought using conventional visual techniques. Finally, this study demonstrates the utility of PAM in providing a detailed and long-term picture of right whale presence in an area that poses a significant risk of anthropogenic mortality. © Inter-Research 2012.","Conservation; Diel variation; Jeffreys ledge; North Atlantic right whale; Passive acoustic monitoring; Seasonality; Stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary; Up-calls","anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; biomonitoring; calling behavior; diel variation; environmental management; mortality; overwintering; seasonal variation; seasonality; species conservation; whale; anthropogenic effect; calling behavior; conservation management; diel variation; endangered species; environmental management; mortality; seasonal variation; seasonality; shipping; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Maine; Massachusetts; Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; United States; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Massachusetts; Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; United States; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Frantantoni, D.M., Diel periodicity in both sei whale vocalization rates and the vertical migration of their copepod prey observed from ocean gliders (2008) Limnol Oceanogr, 53, pp. 2197-2209; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Mussoline, S.E.M., A generalized baleen whale call detection and classification system (2011) J Acoust Soc Am, 129, pp. 2889-2902; Baumgartner, M.F., Lysiak, N.S.J., Schuman, C., Urban-Rich, J., Wenzel, F.W., Diel vertical migration behavior of Calanus finmarchicus and its influence on right and sei whale occurrence (2011) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 423, pp. 167-184; Calpuca, T.A., Fistrup, K.M., Clark, C.W., A compact digital recording system for autonomous bioacoustic monitoring (2000) J Acoust Soc Am, 108, p. 2582; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell Jr., R.L., Baleen whales: conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Rev, 29, pp. 37-62; Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative analysis (1982) Anim Behav, 30, pp. 1060-1071; Clark, C.W., Clapham, P.H., Acoustic monitoring on a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding ground shows continual singing into late spring (2004) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 271, pp. 1051-1057; Clark, C.W., Borsani, J.F., Notabartolo di Sciara, G., Vocal activity of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, in the Ligurian Sea (2002) Mar Mamm Sci, 18, pp. 286-295; Clark, C.W., Gillespie, D., Nowacek, D.P., Parks, S.E., Listening to their world: acoustics for monitoring and protecting right whales in an urbanized ocean (2007) The urban whale, pp. 333-357. , Kraus SD, Rolland RM (eds) Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Hatch, L., Van Parijs, S.M., Frankel, A., Ponirakis, D., Acoustic masking in marine ecosystems: intuitions, analysis, and implication (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 395, pp. 201-222; Clark, C.W., Brown, M.W., Corkeron, P., Visual and acoustic surveys for North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts 2001-2005: management implications (2010) Mar Mamm Sci, 26, pp. 837-854; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Hatch, L.T., Merrick, R.L., Van Parijs, S.M., Wiley, D.N., (2008) An ocean observing system for large-scale monitoring and mapping of noise throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, , http://www.onr.navy.mil/reports/FY09/npclark.pdf, Reports to the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, Award number: N00014-07-1-1029; Cole, T.V.N., Stimpert, A., Pomfret, L., Houle, K., Niemeyer, M., (2007) North Atlantic right whale sighting survey (NARWSS) and right whale sighting advisory system (RWSAS) 2002 results summary, , Ref Doc 07-18a.

These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances. Low-frequency noise from large ships (20–200 Hz) overlaps acoustic signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement, behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for recovery of this endangered right whale population. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Glucocorticoids; Right whales; Ship traffic; Stress; Underwater noise","Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti; glucocorticoid; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; chemistry; comparative study; feces; female; male; noise; physiological stress; physiology; radioimmunoassay; ship; terrorism; whale; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Feces; Female; Glucocorticoids; Male; Noise; Nova Scotia; Radioimmunoassay; September 11 Terrorist Attacks; Ships; Stress, Physiological; Whales",,"Glucocorticoids",,,"National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NMFS, NOAA

The reduced extent and thickness of sea ice and the resultant longer open-water season have major, complex implications for the Arctic marine ecosystem. Increased maritime ship traffic and commercial fishing in the Arctic are bound to affect bowheads and Native (indigenous) hunting communities who depend on whales for subsistence and cultural identity. Bowheads and right whales were greatly depleted by commercial whaling in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Western Arctic bowhead population has been recovering steadily in recent decades, North Atlantic right whales remain highly endangered because of persistent lethal and sublethal vessel strikes and frequent entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Entanglement can be transitory or persistent, with debilitation lasting for months before the animal finally succumbs. Vessel strike and fishing gear trauma has been documented in bowheads, but at a much lower rate than in right whales. Initiatives intended to mitigate the impacts of ship traffic on North Atlantic right whales have included speed limits and routing changes. Those meant to reduce the incidence and severity of entanglements include the modification of gear design and gear deployment practices. Management measures need to be considered in advance in the Arctic in order to minimize the risks to bowhead whales as shipping and industrial fishing expand in the Arctic with ice retreat. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Bowhead whale; Fishing gear entanglement; Ice retreat; Right whale; Vessel strike","commercial activity; fishing; fishing gear; hunting; ice retreat; marine ecosystem; open water; sea ice; shipping; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, WHOI","The following workshop presenters provided thoughtful input: John Adams, Lawson Brigham, Harry Brower, Moira Brown, Ben Ellis, Dan Fitzgerald, Peter Garay, Layla Hughes, Ed Page, Walt Parker, Jan Straley, Angelia Vanderlaan, Janet Whaley, and Bill Wilson.

Large groups of right whales migrate to the coastal waters of New England during the late winter and early spring to feed in an area with large numbers of vessels. North Atlantic right whales have the largest per capita record of vessel strikes of any large whale population in the world. Right whale feeding behaviour in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) probably contributes to risk of collisions with ships. In this study, feeding right whales tagged with archival suction cup tags spent the majority of their time just below the water's surface where they cannot be seen but are shallow enough to be vulnerable to ship strike. Habitat surveys show that large patches of right whale prey are common in the upper 5 m of the water column in CCB during spring. These results indicate that the typical spring-time foraging ecology of right whales may contribute to their high level of mortality from vessel collisions. The results of this study suggest that remote acoustic detection of prey aggregations may be a useful supplement to the management and conservation of right whales. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Endangered species; Foraging ecology; Right whale; Vessel collision","coastal zone; collision; conservation management; endangered species; fishing vessel; foraging behavior; habitat conservation; risk factor; species conservation; water column; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cape Cod Bay; Massachusetts; New England; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Kraus, S.D., North Atlantic right whales in crisis (2005) Science, 309, pp. 561-562. , doi:10.1126/science.1111200; Ward-Geiger, L.I., Silber, G.K., Baumstark, R.D., Pulfer, T.L., Characterization of ship traffic in right whale critical habitat (2005) Coast.

Among the factors considered to have potentially adverse effects on the health and reproduction of E. glacialis are biotoxins produced by certain microalgae responsible for causing harmful algal blooms. The worldwide incidence of these events has continued to increase dramatically over the past several decades and is expected to remain problematic under predicted climate change scenarios. Previous investigations have demonstrated that N. Atlantic right whales are being exposed to at least two classes of algal-produced environmental neurotoxins-paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and domoic acid (DA). Our primary aims during this six-year study (2001-2006) were to assess whether the whales' exposure to these algal biotoxins occurred annually over multiple years, and to what extent individual whales were exposed repeatedly and/or concurrently to one or both toxin classes. Approximately 140 right whale fecal samples obtained across multiple habitats in the western N. Atlantic were analyzed for PSTs and DA. About 40% of these samples were attributed to individual whales in the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog, permitting analysis of biotoxin exposure according to sex, age class, and reproductive status/history. Our findings demonstrate clearly that right whales are being exposed to both of these algal biotoxins on virtually an annual basis in multiple habitats for periods of up to six months (April through September), with similar exposure rates for females and males (PSTs: ~70-80%; DA: ~25-30%). Notably, only one of 14 lactating females sampled did not contain either PSTs or DA, suggesting the potential for maternal toxin transfer and possible effects on neonatal animals. Moreover, 22% of the fecal samples tested for PSTs and DA showed concurrent exposure to both neurotoxins, leading to questions of interactive effects. Targeted studies employing both in vivo and in vitro model systems represent the next logical step in assessing how and to what extent these algal biotoxins might compromise the health and reproduction of this endangered population. © 2011.","Domoic acid; Eubalaena glacialis; Harmful algal blooms; Paralytic shellfish toxins; Reproductive failure; Saxitoxin","domoic acid; neurotoxin; paralytic shellfish toxin; stress hormone; unclassified drug; age class; algal bloom; climate change; endangered species; marine ecosystem; microalga; neonate; neurology; paralytic shellfish poisoning; pollution exposure; population distribution; reproductive health; reproductive status; toxic organism; toxin; whale; alga; animal health; article; DNA extraction; endangered species; environmental exposure; Eubalaena glacialis; feces analysis; high performance liquid chromatography; marine alga; nonhuman; priority journal; reproductive health; toxin analysis; whale; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Endangered Species; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Female; Harmful Algal Bloom; Kainic Acid; Male; Marine Toxins; Neurotoxins; Whales; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); algae; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,"domoic acid, 14277-97-5; neurotoxin, 39386-17-9; Kainic Acid, 487-79-6; Marine Toxins; Neurotoxins; domoic acid, 14277-97-5",,,,,,"Anderson, D.M., Keafer, B.A., McGillicuddy, D.J., Mickelson, M.J., Keay, K.E., Libby, P.S., Manning, J.P., Smith, K.W., Initial observations of the 2005 Alexandrium fundyense bloom in southern New England: general patterns and mechanisms (2005) Deep-Sea Research II, 52, pp. 2856-2876; Aune, T., Risk assessment of marine toxins (2008) Seafood and Freshwater Toxins: Pharmacology, Physiology, and Detection, pp. 3-20. , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, USA, L.M.

These distinctive sounds may be suitable for passive acoustic monitoring and detection of right whales; however, little is known about the prevalence of these sounds in important right whale habitats, such as the Bay of Fundy. This study investigates the timing and distribution of gunshot sound production on the summer feeding grounds using an array of five marine acoustic recording units deployed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in mid-summer 2004 and 2005. Gunshot sounds were common, detected on 37 of 38 recording days. Stereotyped gunshot bouts averaged 1.5 h, with some bouts exceeding 7 h in duration with up to seven individuals producing gunshots at any one time. Bouts were more commonly detected in the late afternoon and evening than during the morning hours. Locations of gunshots in bouts indicated that whales producing the sounds were either stationary or showed directional travel, suggesting gunshots have different communication functions depending on behavioral context. These results indicate that gunshots are a common right whale sound produced during the summer months and are an important component in the acoustic communication system of this endangered species.",,"acoustics; animal; animal behavior; article; male; periodicity; physiology; population migration; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animal Migration; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Male; Periodicity; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD

Data on call types and individual rates of sound production are necessary to use passive acoustics to identify species, assess individual detectability, and estimate the number of individuals present. The present study describes the sound production behavior of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, during July and August, recorded with suction cup archival tags (Dtag) in 2000 to 2002 and 2005. The Dtag simultaneously recorded acoustic data from a hydrophone along with the depth and orientation of the whale. Over 168 h of acoustic data were obtained from 46 tag deployments (35 ind.), with an average attachment duration of 4.5 h. The rate of sound production was variable, ranging from 0 to 200 calls h-1 (mean ± SD: 6.4 ± 29.8 calls h-1), with 28 of the 46 tagged whales producing no calls (corresponding to 69/168 h of data). Right whale sounds from any whale in the area were recorded on most tag records, indicating that aggregations of whales may be detected more reliably than individuals. Calling rates were highest during surface activity and traveling and lowest during foraging and logging behavior. Whales of both sexes and all age-classes produced upcalls and other tonal calls, and 1 adult male produced gunshot sounds. The present study provides insight from the largest extant collection of recordings of individual North Atlantic right whales into the acoustic detectability of individual right whales and demonstrates that the behavioral state is the primary factor affecting calling rate. © Inter-Research 2011.","Eubalaena; North Atlantic right whale; Passive acoustic detection; Sound production; Tags","acoustics; communication behavior; detection method; endangered species; monitoring system; vocalization; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy",,,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Chapman, D.M.F., You can't get there from here: shallow water sound propagation and whale localization (2004) Can Acoust, 32, pp. 167-171; Clark, C.W., A real-time direction finding device for determining the bearing to the underwater sounds of southern right whales (1980) Eubalaena australis.

Food energy density (kJ m-3) is a function of C5 concentration (m-3) and individual C5 lipid energy content (J) that increases by 2 orders of magnitude from near the surface to ~18 kJ m-3 at ~160 m depth; this observation helps explain why right whales concentrate their foraging efforts at depth. Food energy density can vary by a factor of 4 over a tidal cycle and 3.5 over a horizontal distance of ~2 km in the deeper strata of the Basin. By tracing water mass trajectories, we show that it is the warmer, saltier and denser water that contains the highest food energy density that is tidally advected within the Basin. At the scale of the Basin (10s of kilometres) we observed maximum food energy densities of ~25 kJ m-3 in the 140 to 160 m depth stratum where the highest energy densities spatially coincide with the highest historical right whale concentrations. We concluded that the tidal variation and tidally driven circulation represents the simplest explanation for the distribution of food energy density and for the distribution of right whales in the Grand Manan Basin region and that Basin topography and water mass excursions associated with tidal currents facilitate the persistence of C5 aggregations in the dense deep water. © Inter-Research 2011.","Bay of Fundy; Calanus finmarchicus; Energy content; Right whale; Tide","energy flow; food availability; foraging behavior; lipid; observational method; quantitative analysis; spatial variation; tidal cycle; whale; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Canada; Grand Manan Archipelago; New Brunswick",,,,,,,,"Aretxabaleta, A.L., McGillicuddy Jr., D.J., Smith, K.W., Lynch, D.R., Model simulations of the Bay of Fundy Gyre: 1 (2008) Climatological results.

We use right whale survey data and Canadian fishing-gear deployment data to estimate the relative threat of gear entanglement in a Scotia-Fundy study area and the relative risk of lethal entanglement in the Bay of Fundy and on Roseway Basin, Scotian Shelf, where Critical Habitat has been legislated. We focus on groundfish and pelagic hook-and-line; groundfish gillnet; and crab-, hagfish-, and inshore and offshore lobster-trap gear. Our analyses demonstrate that groundfish hook-and-line gear poses the greatest threat to right whales among the seven gear types analysed during the summer-resident period in Critical Habitat and that gear from the lobster fisheries poses the greatest threat during the spring and autumn periods when whales are migrating to and from Critical Habitat. We suggest that area-specific seasonal closures of some fisheries would reduce threat and risk to whales without unduly compromising fishing interests.",,"commercial activity; endangered species; extinction risk; fish; fishing gear; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; lobster fishery; seasonality; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Canada; Roseway Basin; Scotia Shelf",,,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Duffus, D.A., Langelier, K.M., An evaluation of gray whale (Eschrishtius robustus) mortality incidental to fishing operations in British Columbia, Canada (2002) J.

Prior to a December 2008 implementation of a mandatory, seasonally based vessel-speed rule (10 knots, 18.5 km h -1) along the eastern US seaboard, voluntary recommended speeds and routes were established. We used Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to evaluate and compare the compliance rates between the mandatory and voluntary measures to protect right whales in the southeast US critical habitat area off Florida and Georgia during the winters from 2005-06 to 2008-09. Vessel compliance was significantly higher under mandatory versus voluntary recommended speed restrictions, with compliance rates of 75 and 16%, respectively. Average vessel speeds were slower under mandatory speed restrictions (10.5 knots, 19.6 km h -1) compared to voluntary recommended speed restrictions (14.5 knots, 26.9 km h -1). Although vessels only slow down when mandated, they change their routing voluntarily. Compliance rates with voluntary recommended routes steadily increased during this period, from 43% prior to rulemaking, to 52% during the first year, 84% in the second year, and 96% in the final year of the study. Combining reduced speeds with recommended routes reduces the probability of right whale mortality from ships by 71.9% from the pre-implementation period. These results support long-term implementation of both vessel-speed reduction and restricted vessel routes for the survival and recovery of the North Atlantic right whale. © Inter-Research 2011.","Automatic identification system; Eubalaena glacialis; Recommended routes; Right whale; Ship strike; Southeast USA; Speed restrictions","endangered species; habitat conservation; identification method; mortality; nature conservation; survival; vessel; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Allen, C.H., (2005) Farwell's rules of the nautical road, , Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD; Fonnesbeck, C.J., Garrison, L.P., Ward-Geiger, L.I., Baumstark, R.D., Bayesian hierarchichal model for evaluating the risk of vessel strikes on North Atlantic right whales in the SE United States (2008) Endang Species Res, 6, pp. 87-94; Fujiwara, M., Caswell, H., Demography of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 537-541; Glass, A.H., Cole, T.V.N., Garron, M., Mortality and serious injury determinations for baleen whale stocks along the United States eastern seaboard and adjacent Canadian Maritimes, 2003-2007 (2009) Northeast Fish Sci Cent Ref Doc 09-04, , Northeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, Woods Hole, MA; Gorzelany, J.F., Evaluation of boater compliance with manatee speed zones along the Gulf Coast of Florida (2004) Coast Manage, 32, pp. 215-226; Hatch, L., Clark, C., Merrick, R., Van Parijs, S., Characterizing the relative contributions of large vessels to total ocean noise fields: a case study using the Gerry E.Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (2008) Environ Manage, 42, pp. 735-752; (2004) IALA guideline no. 1028 on the Automatic Identification System (AIS): Part I.

Amplitude-mode ultrasound was used to measure the thickness of right whale integument (epidermis and blubber, herein referred to as blubber thickness) in E. glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada for 5 summer seasons and in E. australis off the South African coast for 2 austral winter seasons. E. glacialis had significantly thinner blubber layers (mean ±1 SD = 12.23 ± 2.16 cm, n = 172) than E. australis (16.13 ± 3.88 cm, n = 117), suggesting differing levels of nutrition between the 2 species. Blubber was thickest in females measured 3 to 6 mo prior to the start of pregnancy (E. glacialis), thinner during lactation (E. glacialis, E. australis) and then thicker with time after weaning (E. glacialis). These results suggest that lipids in blubber are used as energetic support for reproduction in female right whales. Blubber thickness increased in calves during suckling (E. glacialis, E. australis) but sub - sequently decreased after weaning (E. glacialis). Juvenile and adult male E. glacialis blubber thicknesses were compared between years of differing prey Calanus finmarchicus abundances (data from Pershing et al. 2005; ICES J Mar Sci 62:1511-1523); during a year of low prey abundance whales had significantly thinner blubber than during years of greater prey abundance. Taken together, these results suggest that blubber thickness is indicative of right whale energy balance and that the marked fluctuations in North Atlantic right whale reproduction have a nutritional component. © Inter-Research 2011.","Blubber thickness;

However, preliminary studies have brought to light enough historical references to suggest that whaling occurred from at least the 13th century, and the present work identifies 38 historical sources documenting whale use or whaling on the Portuguese coast between 1201 and 1728. A peak of whale-related sources occurred during the 13th and 14th centuries, and almost all Portuguese accounts are contemporary to those found from the French and Spanish Basque countries, such that the beginning of the whaling activity seems to be coeval. No geographical cluster of whaling activities can be established-they seem to have been unevenly scattered along the entire coastline. Nor can a chronological north-south movement of coastal whaling activities be discerned. The geographical and chronological patterns give support to the assumption that whaling was not introduced to Portugal by the Basques, who are known to have spread westward from the French Labourd (11th century), via Golf of Biscay, to Asturias, and southward to Galicia (14th century). Rather, Portuguese whale use seems to have originated independently of Basque influence. Several of the sources specify ""black whales"" as the target species. This is consistent with modern knowledge about the distribution and migration patterns of North Atlantic right whales during Basque medieval and early modern whaling. The Portuguese sources are not clear as to numbers of whales taken, nor to the whaling technology used, but the activity was sufficiently well organized and developed to warrant the levying of tithes in the feudal system of 13th-century Portugal. © ISAZ 2011.","Basque whaling; Historical sources; Portugal; Whale use; Whaling","chronology; exploitation; historical geography; historical record; marine resource; Medieval; North-South relations; technology adoption; whaling; Portugal; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., The Black right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, in the Cantabrian Sea (1981) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 457-459; Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its incidence on the right whales of the North Atlantic (1986) Right Whales: Past and Present Status, pp. 191-199. , ed.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic data; Automated detection; Automated detection and classification; Baleen whales; Borealis; Broad application; Broadband noise; Classification system; Discriminant function analysis; Eubalaena glacialis; Gulf of Maine; Low frequency; Marine mammals; Narrow bands; North Atlantic; Occurrence and distribution; Passive acoustic monitoring; Pitch-tracking; Right whales; Sei whale; Spatial scale; Spring season; Temporal variability; Temporal variation; Mammals; Discriminant analysis; acoustics; algorithm; animal; article; Balaenoptera; classification; discriminant analysis; endangered species; human; image subtraction; instrumentation; marine biology; methodology; noise; observer variation; physiology; psychophysics; recording; sound detection; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Algorithms; Animals; Balaenoptera; Copying Processes; Discriminant Analysis; Endangered Species; Humans; Marine Biology; Noise; Observer Variation; Psychoacoustics; Sound Spectrography; Subtraction Technique; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","We are grateful to Chris Clark and the Cornell Bioacoustics Research Program for the lease of the MARUs, Christopher Tremblay and Ingrid Biedron for their skillful deployment and recovery of the recorders, the officers and crew of the R/V Albatross IV , and chief scientist Fred Wenzel.

Designated as a conservation area in 1993, before the Oceans Act came into effect, the Grand Manan conservation area currently does not form part of the Canadian network of MPAs. Given the possibility that MPA designation may occur, the paper examines factors that should be considered in meeting International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) MPA design criteria and IUCN evaluation model requirements. An MPA evaluation framework based on an IUCN evaluation model (Hockings et al., 2000 [1]) is designed to assess the effectiveness of an MPA in protecting a migratory right whale. Case study results indicate that current management and research activities for the Grand Manan conservation area address most governance, biophysical and socio-economic issues under an IUCN evaluation framework. On a site basis, it is recommended that the Grand Manan conservation area be designated as a component of the Canadian network of MPAs and that regulations be developed and implemented under the Species at Risk Act to clearly define activities considered damaging or destructive to right whale critical habitat. Recommendations also suggest the preparation of a combined site management-action plan for the Grand Manan conservation area indicating how activities specified in North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Strategy will be implemented locally. On a regional and international basis, recommendations call for an internationally coordinated and integrated approach to right whale protection within the context of a network of designated critical habitat areas. Recommended activities include: continued Canadian participation in cross-border research and actions to mitigate threats to the right whales over their migratory range; development of a regional right whale management and monitoring strategy; and designation of additional critical habitats in national/international waters. It is further recommended that the evaluation framework developed by this paper be used as a model in assessing the conservation and management effectiveness of MPAs protecting other migratory marine species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Eubalaena glacialis; Grand Manan Basin whale sanctuary; Marine protected area; North Atlantic right whale","conservation management; marine policy; migratory species; protected area; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Grand Manan Archipelago; New Brunswick; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Hockings, M., Stolton, S., Dudley, N., (2000), pp. x + 121. , http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/PAG-006.pdf, Evaluating effectiveness: a framework for assessing the management of protected areas.

Many marine species rely on sound for vital life functions including communication, navigation and feeding. The impacts of significant increases in ocean noise levels from human activities are a current area of concern for the conservation of marine mammals. Here, we document changes in calling behaviour by individual endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in increased background noise. Right whales, like several bird and primate species, respond to periods of increased noise by increasing the amplitude of their calls. This behaviour may help maintain the communication range with conspecifics during periods of increased noise. These call modifications have implications for conservation efforts for right whales, affecting both the way whales use sound to communicate and our ability to detect them with passive acoustic monitoring systems.

We characterized the DVM behavior of late-stage Calanus finmarchicus in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2005 to 2007, and investigated the influence of this behavior on the occurrence of zooplanktivorous baleen whales. On 5 occasions, we occupied an oceanographic station for 1 to 2 d and conducted (1) a half-hourly census of whales and (2) a half-hourly cast with an instrument package measuring temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and copepod abundance. We observed significant variability in DVM behavior both within and among years that was unrelated to stratification or chlorophyll concentration. Instead, DVM appeared to be influenced by the vertical distribution of phytoplankton, the presence of visual predators (sand lance Ammodytes spp.), copepod developmental stage, and the feeding history of individual copepods. Migrating copepods had oil sacs that were 44% larger than non-migrating copepods at the surface after accounting for developmental stage, which suggests that well-fed copepods are more likely to vertically migrate. While the occurrence of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis was unrelated to variability in the migration behavior of C. finmarchicus, sei whales Balaenoptera borealis were significantly less abundant during times of strong DVM behavior. We speculate that right whales do not compete directly with sand lance and herring for C. finmarchicus, but by inducing DVM behavior, these fish are likely influencing the distribution and abundance of sei whales in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. © Inter-Research 2011.","Balaenoptera borealis; Calanus finmarchicus; Eubalaena glacialis; Gulf of Maine; Optical plankton counter; Right whale; Sei whale; Video plankton recorder","abundance; behavioral ecology; chlorophyll; crustacean; developmental stage; diel migration; fluorescence; oceanography; phytoplankton; salinity; species occurrence; temperature effect; vertical distribution; whale; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Ammodytes; Ammodytidae; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Batchelder, H.P., Seasonal abundance, vertical distribution, and life history of Metridia pacifica (Copepoda: Calanoida) in the oceanic subarctic Pacific (1985) Deep-sea Res A, 32, pp. 949-964; Baumgartner, M.F., Comparisons of Calanus finmarchicus fifth copepodite abundance estimates from nets and an optical plankton counter (2003) Journal of Plankton Research, 25 (7), pp. 855-868. , DOI 10.1093/plankt/25.7.855; Baumgartner, M.F., Fratantoni, D.M., Diel periodicity in both sei whale vocalization rates and the vertical migration of their copepod prey observed from ocean gliders (2008) Limnol Oceanogr, 53, pp. 2197-2209; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 137-154; Baumgartner, M.F., Van Parijs, S.M., Wenzel, F.W., Tremblay, C.J., Esch, H.C., Warde, A.M., Low frequency vocalizations attributed to sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) (2008) J Acoust Soc Am, 124, pp. 1339-1349; Beare, D., McKenzie, E., Continuous Plankton Recorder data and diel vertical migration in stage V and VI Calanus finmarchicus: A statistical analysis (1999) Fisheries Oceanography, 8 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 126-137. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2419.1999.00005.x; Bollens, S.M., Frost, B.W., Zooplanktivorous fish and variable diel vertical migration in the marine planktonic copepod Calanus pacificus (1989) Limnol Oceanogr, 34, pp. 1072-1083; Bollens, S.M., Frost, B.W., Thoreson, D.S., Watts, S.J., Diel vertical migration in zooplankton: field evidence in support of the predator avoidance hypothesis (1992) Hydrobiologia, 234 (1), pp. 33-39; Bost, C.A., Zorn, T., Le Maho, Y., Duhamel, G., Feeding of diving predators and diel vertical migration of prey: King penguins' diet versus trawl sampling at Kerguelen Islands (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 227, pp. 51-61; Campbell, R.G., Wagner, M.M., Teegarden, G.J., Boudreau, C.A., Durbin, E.G., Growth and development rates of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus reared in the laboratory (2001) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 221, pp. 161-183; Campbell, R.G., Runge, J.A., Durbin, E.G., Evidence for food limitation of Calanus finmarchicus production rates on the southern flank of Georges Bank during April 1997 (2001) Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 48 (1-3), pp. 531-549. , DOI 10.1016/S0967-0645(00)00089-8, PII S0967064500000898; (1982) A Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid- and North Atlantic Areas of the US Outer Continental Shelf, , CETAP, Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, Final Report.

The objective of this study was to examine the availability of the right whale's main prey, Calanus finmarchicus, in Roseway Basin during those 7 years to determine if the whales' absence was due to inadequate prey resources. Since we had no historical data on zooplankton abundances at depth on the Scotian Shelf, near-surface zooplankton abundance data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder were used to infer water-column abundances. In addition, environmental parameters that are often correlated with high zooplankton concentrations were examined. The hypotheses tested were that changes in these parameters would be detectable between three time periods: pre-1993, 1993-1999 and post-1999. Calanus finmarchicus abundance was found to be lowest during 1993-1999, suggesting that right whales were not foraging in Roseway Basin because of the near-absence of their main prey species. Decreased in situ salinity and density proved to be indicators of the changes in circulation in the 1990s that may have affected the advection of C. finmarchicus onto the Scotian Shelf. © The Author 2010.

Current management protocols in US waters are triggered by identifying the presence of at least one right whale in a management area. We assessed whether acoustic detection of right whale contact calls can work as an alternative to visual aerial surveys for establishing their presence. Aerial survey and acoustic monitoring were conducted in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, in 2001-2005 and used to evaluate and compare right whale detections. Over the 58 d with simultaneous aerial and acoustic coverage, aerial surveys saw whales on approximately two-thirds of the days during which acoustic monitoring heard whales. There was no strong relationship between numbers of whales seen during aerial surveys and numbers of contact calls detected on survey days. Results indicate acoustic monitoring is a more reliable mechanism than aerial survey for detecting right whales. Because simple detection is sufficient to trigger current management protocols, continuous, autonomous acoustic monitoring provides information of immediate management utility more reliably than aerial surveillance. Aerial surveys are still required to provide data for estimating population parameters and for visually assessing the frequency and severity of injuries from shipping and fishing and detecting injured and entangled right whales. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic monitoring; Aerial survey; Detection; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic right whale","aerial survey; bioacoustics; detection method; endangered species; environmental monitoring; fishing; human activity; injury; mortality; species conservation; visual analysis; whale; Cape Cod Bay; Massachusetts; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Boston Society of Natural History, 8, pp. 105-322; Breslow, N.E., Extra-Poisson variation in log-linear models (1984) Applied Statistics, 33, pp. 38-44; Brown, M.W., (1994), p. 167. , Population structure and seasonal variation of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis).

The interpretation of these studies is enhanced when the defecator is identified, as data can then be linked to individual life history information. Fecal samples (n= 118) were either collected from single photoidentified whales, associated with several individuals by photoidentification of whales in the vicinity upon sample collection, or were collected when no whales were in the vicinity. Genetic profiles from fecal DNA comprising sex, mitochondrial haplotype, and five microsatellite loci helped assign specific samples to individual right whales based on existing genetic profiles. Profiles were informative in assigning 61 fecal samples to known individuals, 24 of which were collected when no whales were in the vicinity. Whales identified genetically were typically photographed in the same habitat area and on the same day of sample collection (n= 35/48). Twelve profiles new to the genetic database were identified, suggesting fecal sampling provides a means to obtain genetic profiles from previously unsampled individuals, which may help refine estimates of population size and habitat use patterns if annual fecal sampling continues. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Eubalaena glacialis; Fecal genotyping; Individual identification; North Atlantic right whale; Probability of identity","database; feces; genetic analysis; genetic marker; habitat use; identification method; individual variation; life history; molecular analysis; photography; population size; reproduction; sampling; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aasen, E., Medrano, J.F., Amplification of the ZFY and ZFX genes for sex identification in humans, cattle, sheep and goats (1990) Biotechniques, 8, pp. 1279-1281; Ahn, S.J., Costa, J., Emanuel, J.R., PicoGreen quantification of DNA: Effective evaluation of samples pre- or post-PCR (1996) Nucleic Acids Research, 24, pp. 2623-2625; Ball, M., Pither, R., Manseau, M., Clark, J., Petersen, S.D., Kingston, S., Morrill, N., Wilson, P., Characterization of target nuclear DNA from faeces reduces technical issues associated with the assumptions of low-quality and quantity template (2007) Conservation Genetics, 8, pp. 577-586; Bonin, A., Bellemain, E., Eidesen, P.E., Pompanon, F., Brochmann, C., Taberlet, P., How to track and assess genotyping errors in population genetic studies (2004) Molecular Ecology, 13, pp. 3261-3273; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Gaskin, D.E., Reactions of North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, to skin biopsy sampling for genetic and pollutant analysis (1991) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

Right whale life history data from 1993 to 2005 were analyzed to determine the duration of cow/calf associations and where the pair separated. A change occurred with the 2001 cows; 71% of those available stayed with their calves into the second year and this behavior remained elevated for several years. Less experienced cows, independent of their age, were more likely to extend their associations. The occurrence of cow/yearling associations was not related to the length of the cow's previous interbirth interval, used as a proxy for cow condition, but the hypothesis that body condition impacts how long cows nurse their young could not be adequately tested. Seventy-seven percent of the observed cow/yearling pairs also returned to the calving ground, a substantial physiological investment given the 1,450 km plus migration and the fact that they fast there, indicating that factors other than nutrition also influenced the cow's behavior. The concurrent increase in juveniles in the shallow waters of the winter calving grounds may afford naive whales greater protection from predators or provide a social benefit that improves their overall fitness. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Calving ground; Eubalaena glacialis; Extended lactation; Interbirth interval; Maternal investment; Right whale; Social learning; Weaning; Yearling","age class; body condition; data set; feeding ground; fitness; lactation; learning; life history; maternal care; migration; parental investment; weaning; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Berger, J., Weaning conflict in desert and mountain bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadenis): Anecological interpretation (1979) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 50, pp. 188-200; Best, P.B., Schaeff, C.M., Reeb, D., Palsbøll, P.J., Composition and possible function of social groupings of southern right whales in South African waters (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 1469-1494; Birgerson, B., Ekvall, K., Early growth in male and female fallow deer fawns (1997) Behavioral Ecology, 8, pp. 493-499; Bowen, W.D., Iverson, S.J., McMillan, J.I., Boness, D.J., Reproductive performance in grey seals: Age-related improvement and senescence in a capital breeder (2006) Ecology, 75, pp. 1340-1351; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Gaskin, D.E., White, B.N., Sexual composition and analysis of reproductive females in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, population (1994) Marine Mammal Science, 10, pp. 253-265; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Slay, C.K., Garrison, L.P., The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads (2007) Surveying for discovery, science and management, pp. 105-137. , Pages, in, S.

The magnitude of this threat is likely to increase as maritime commerce expands. Factors influencing the incidence and severity of ship strikes are not well understood, although vessel speed appears to be a strong contributor. The purpose of this study was to characterize the hydrodynamic effects near a moving hull that may cause a whale to be drawn to or repelled from the hull, and to assess the accelerations exerted on a whale at the time of impact. Using scale models of a container ship and a right whale in experimental flow tanks, we assessed hydrodynamic effects and measured accelerations experienced by the whale model in the presence of a moving vessel. Accelerations at impact were measured while the whale was at the surface, for various vessel speeds, orientations of the whale relative to the vessel path, and distances off the direct path of the vessel. Accelerations experienced by the whale model in a collision: increased in magnitude with increasing ship speed; were not dependent on whale orientation to the vessel path; and decreased exponentially with increasing separation distances from the ship track. Subsequent experiments with the whale model submerged at one to two times the ship's draft indicated a pronounced propeller suction effect, a drawing of the whale toward the hull, and increased probability of propeller strikes resulting from this class of encounter. Measured accelerations are a proxy for impact severity, but do not constitute a detailed study of injury mechanism in a living animal, though they may help inform future work. We present a heuristic map of the hydrodynamic field around a transiting hull likely involved in close whale/vessel encounters. These results may have bearing on policy decisions, particularly those involving vessel speed, aimed at protecting large whales from ship strikes worldwide. © 2010.","Hydrodynamics; Ship strike; Whale/vessel collisions","collision; container ship; endangered species; environmental disturbance; future prospect; hull; hydrodynamic force; hydrodynamics; vulnerability; whale; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","We are grateful for the encouragement and expertise provided by Cybelline Aclan, Michael Benulis, David Cottingham, Tom Fetherston, Gabor Karafaith, Daniel Lyons, Dennis Mullinix, and Hung Vo.

The concentrations of PBDEs in winter flounder and right whales were similar in magnitude to the levels of PCBs, which was unlike the pattern observed in seals. In these marine mammals, the levels of PBDEs were orders of magnitude lower than the levels of OCs and PCBs detected. Evidence existed for the accumulation of methoxylated (MeO)-PBDEs of natural origin in seals and right whales. Current-use, non-PBDE BFRs (including hexabromocyclododecane, pentabromoethylbenzene, hexabromobenzene, and pentabromotoluene) were detected in winter flounder and marine mammals.

We present two new approaches consisting of machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NET) and the classification and regression tree classifiers (CART), and compare their performance with earlier work that employs multi-Stage feature vector testing (FVT) approach. A combined total of over 100,000 noise and NRW up-call events were used in the study. Calls were primarily recorded from two areas, Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Of the three classifiers, the CART had the highest assignment rates, overall 86.45% with highest false positive rates (<100 per hour). The FVT Method had exceptionally low false positive rates, with <50 per hour. However, it had an overall assignment rate less than the NET. The CART had statistically the same false positive rate as the NET with the highest assignment rates, 2.2% higher than the NET and 11.75% greater than the FVT Method. Details of the results are shown and extensions to the research are discussed. © 2010 IEEE.","Acoustic monitoring; Artifical neural network; Automated detection; Classfication regression tree; Right whale","Acoustic monitoring; Artificial Neural Network; Automated detection; Classification and regression tree; Eubalaena glacialis; False positive rates; Feature vectors; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Multi-stage; New approaches; North Atlantic; Recognition algorithm; Regression trees; Right whales; Acoustic measuring instruments; Acoustic signal processing; Classifiers; Face recognition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Oceanography; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,"Mellinger, D.K., Stafford, K.M., Moore, S.E., Dziak, R.P., Matsumoto, H., An overview of fixed passive acoustic observation methods for cetaceans (2007) Oceanography, 20, pp. 36-45; Van Parijs, S.M., Clark, C.W., Sousa-Lima, R.S., Parks, S.E., Rankin, S., Risch, D., Van Opzeeland, I.C., Management and research applications of real-time and archival passive acoustic sensors over varying temporal and spatial scales (2009) Mar.

Both online and offline systems exist to help study and protect animals within this population. In both cases auto-detection of species-specific calls plays a vital role in localizing individual animal by searching time-frequency passive acoustic data. This research presents an experimental system, referred to as the NRW-CRITIC, for automatic detection of the NRW contact call. In general, the CRITIC uses a combinatorial classifier approach to integrate a series of existing machine learning algorithms; each designed specifically for NRW contact call identification. The proposed configuration consists of several recognition methods running in parallel; these include linear discriminant analysis, artificial neural network (NET) and classification regression tree (CART). This paper presents the details for the NRW-CRITIC and discusses the approach used to combine multiple independent decisions into a single result. A side-by-side performance comparison, between the CRITIC and a well-known method, the feature vector testing (FVT), is summarized. Performance metrics are evaluated based on a large database of acoustic recordings consisting of over 58,000 NRW contact calls from various locations, including two critical habitats, Great South Channel and Cape Cod Bay. Results indicate the FVT algorithm yields a74.7% detection probability with an error rate of 4.35%. In comparison the CRITIC, operating at similar information level yields a 78.02% detection probability with a 3.25% error rate, exceeding the performance of the FVT. Performance was also measured using data from a multi-channel acoustic array located in Massachusetts Bay. A side-by-side comparison of array presence is discussed for two separate days. Results show that with the FVT and CRITIC operating at 0% error for array presence, the FVT method had 18,769 and 24,469 false positives for the Massachusetts Bay dataseis respectively. With the same 0% error condition the CRITIC provided successful detection with significantly lower number of false positive rates: 1,072 and 2,324 calls, respectively. Future extensions of this experimental work are also discussed. © 2010 IEEE.","Acoustic monitoring; Automated detection; Multi-Classifier; Right whale","Acoustic monitoring; Artificial Neural Network; Auto-detection; Automated detection; Automatic Detection; Classification regression; Combinatorial classifiers; Detection probabilities; Endangered species; Error condition; Error rate; Eubalaena glacialis; Experimental system; False positive; False positive rates; Feature vectors; Large database; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine learning algorithms; Massachusetts; Multi-channel; Multi-classifier; North Atlantic; Offline systems; Passive acoustics; Performance comparison; Performance metrics; Recognition methods; Right whales; Running-in; Searching time; Acoustic measuring instruments; Acoustic signal processing; Animals; Classifiers; Combinatorial mathematics; Conservation; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Image retrieval; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Oceanography; Online systems; Optical variables measurement; Signal detection; Signal processing; Error detection",,,,,,,,"Clark, C.W., Gillespie, D., Nowacek, D.P., Parks, S.E., Listening to their world: Acoustics for monitoring and protecting right whales in an urbanized ocean (2007) The Urban Whale: North Atlantic Right Whales at the Crossroads, pp. 333-357. , S.

Here we examined the specific life history period from just before birth through the first year to estimate calf and perinatal losses between 1989 and 2003. The lower bound estimate (17 mortalities from 208 calving events) included documented calf mortalities and presumed deaths from serious injury or disappearance from the sighting record. The upper bound estimated potential calf losses from females with delayed first parturition (>10 yr) and shortened (2 yr) or lengthened (≥4 yr) calving intervals, if the female migrated to the calving ground during these intervals. Because cows were sighted in the calving ground predominantly in years when they were available to calve, adult females sighted there in a possible calving year without a calf were assumed to have experienced a perinatal loss. Twenty-eight potential perinatal losses were detected, bringing the upper bound of calf and perinatal mortality to 45 (3.0 calves/yr). The high frequency of lengthened calving intervals in E. glacialis suggests that abortion and neonatal losses are contributing to lower reproductive success compared to Southern Hemisphere right whales (Eubalaena australis). © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Abortion; Calf mortality; Calving intervals; Eubalaena glacialis; Neonatal; Perinatal; Reproduction; Right whale","abortion; injury; life history; morality; reproductive success; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 161-169; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Slay, C.K., Garrison, L.P., Surveying for discovery, science, and management (2007) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, pp. 105-137. , Kraus S D, Rolland R M.

Because each offspring represents a large portion of a female's reproductive effort, strong selection pressure should be in place to minimize the potential for misplaced parental effort. However, we describe a case in which two North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) offspring were switched between mothers and remained with their ""adopted"" mothers throughout their first year of life (until they were weaned). The most reasonable explanation is that this swap was an accident caused by the females calving in close spatial and temporal proximity. The calves likely associated with the wrong mothers before any mother-offspring recognition system had developed, and an association then formed between these non-biological mother-offspring pairs. These data raise intriguing questions regarding how often this may occur in other wildlife populations, what mechanisms are used for mother-offspring recognition in whales, and how long it takes for this recognition to develop.","Adoption; Eubalaena glacialis; Mother-offspring recognition; North Atlantic right whale; Parental care","adoption behavior; lactation; maternal care; parent-offspring interaction; parental care; recognition; spatiotemporal analysis; weaning; whale; Animalia; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Alcock, J., (1998) Animal behavior: An evolutionary approach, , (6th ed.).

Titrated intra muscular injections to achieve sedation were undertaken on two free swimming right whales. Methodology/Principal Findings: Following initial trials with beached whales, a sedation protocol was developed for right whales. Mass was estimated from sighting and necropsy data from comparable right whales. Midazolam (0.01 to 0.025 mg/ kg) was first given alone or with meperidine (0.17 to 0.25 mg/kg) either once or four times over two hours to whale #1102 by cantilevered pole syringe. In the last attempt on whale #1102 there appeared to be a mild effect in 20-30 minutes, with duration of less than 2 hours that included exhalation before the blowhole fully cleared the water. Boat avoidance, used as a measure of sedation depth, was not reduced. A second severely entangled animal in 2009, whale #3311, received midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) followed by butorphanol (0.03 mg/kg) an hour later, delivered ballistically. Two months later it was then given midazolam (0.07 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.07 mg/kg) simultaneously. The next day both drugs at 0.1 mg/kg were given as a mixture in two darts 10 minutes apart. The first attempt on whale #3311 showed increased swimming speed and boat avoidance was observed after a further 20 minutes. The second attempt on whale #3311 showed respiration increasing mildly in frequency and decreasing in strength. The third attempt on whale #3311 gave a statistically significant increase in respiratory frequency an hour after injection, with increased swimming speed and marked reduction of boat evasion that enabled decisive cuts to entangling gear. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that butorphanol and midazolam delivered ballistically in appropriate dosages and combinations may have merit in future refractory free swimming entangled right whale cases until other entanglement solutions are developed.",,"butorphanol; midazolam; pethidine; butorphanol; midazolam; pethidine; animal experiment; article; autopsy; avoidance behavior; breathing; breathing rate; exhalation; nonhuman; sea; sedation; swimming; whale; animal; animal behavior; Atlantic Ocean; conscious sedation; methodology; physiology; ship; time; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Behavior, Animal; Butorphanol; Conscious Sedation; Meperidine; Midazolam; Ships; Time Factors; Whales",,"butorphanol, 42408-82-2; midazolam, 59467-70-8; pethidine, 28097-96-3, 50-13-5, 57-42-1; Butorphanol, 42408-82-2; Meperidine, 57-42-1; Midazolam, 59467-70-8",,,,,,"Kraus, S.D., Brown, M.W., Caswell, H., Clark, C.W., Fujiwara, M., North Atlantic right whales in crisis (2005) Science, 309, pp. 561-562; Moore, M.J., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., McLellan, W., Bonde, R., Morphometry, gross morphology and available histopathology in Northwest Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) mortalities (1970 to 2002) (2004) Journal Cetacean Research and Management, 6, pp. 199-214; Lien, J., Teaching fishermen about whales (1986) Whalewatcher, 20, pp. 3-7; Moore, M.J., Miller, C.A., Morss, M.S., Arthur, R., Lange, W.A., Ultrasonic measurement of blubber thickness in right whales (2001) Journal Cetacean Research and Management Special Issue, 2, pp. 301-309; Haulena, M., Heath, R., Marine mammal anesthesia (2001) CRC Handbook of Marine Mammal Medicine, pp. 655-702. , Dierauf L, Gulland F, eds, Boca Raton, FL, pp; Joseph, B.E., Cornell, L.H., The use of meperidine hydrochloride for chemical restraint in certain cetaceans and pinnipeds (1988) J Wildl Dis, 24, pp. 691-694; Reidarson, T.H., Harrell, J.H., Rinaldi, M.G., McBain, J., Bronchoscopic and serologic diagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus pulmonary infection in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (1998) Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine, 29, pp. 451-455; Schevill, W.E., Ray, C., Kenyon, K.W., Orr, R.T., Van Gelder, R.G., Immobilizing drugs lethal to swimming mammals (1967) Science, 157, pp. 630-631; Brunson, D., Rowles, T., Gulland, F., Walsh, M., Dunn, L., Techniques for drug delivery and sedation of a free-ranging North Atlantic Right Whale (Balaena glacialis) (2002) Proceedings American Association Zoo Veterinarians, pp. 320-322; Walsh, M., Gearhart, S., Chittick, E., Sedation and anesthesia techniques in cetaceans (2006) Proceedings American Association Zoo Veterinarians, , 237 p; Chittick, E., Gearhart, S., Dold, C., Preliminary findings with butorphanol sedation in cetaceans (2006) Proceedings International Association of Aquatic Animal Medicine, pp. 144-145; Geraci JR, Lounsbury VJ (2005) Marine mammals ashore: a field guide for strandings.

From an evolutionary perspective, this process represents the generation of new mitochondrial diversity within a species. Although this has been documented in some mammalian species, it has been reported from relatively few wild mammalian populations and in no wild nonhuman population has the transfer and segregation of mitochondrial heteroplasmy been tracked through multiple generations. We report on the first case of the identification and tracking of mitochondrial control region heteroplasmy through 3 generations in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis.

This research measured the elevations above the seabed of 17 regular groundlines on commercially active lobster gear in the Bay of Fundy and evaluated several factors governing rope elevation profiles. Mean elevation was 1.6 m (s.d. = 0.9, n = 5968, range = 0.0-7.0 m). The hypothesis that groundline elevations were ≤1.0 m (predicted height of taut groundlines) was rejected (Fisher's C = 66.9, p &lt; 0.01), as was the hypothesis that elevations were &gt;3.0 m (approximate body height of a right whale; Fisher's C = 129.5, p &lt; 0.01). The proportion of groundline elevations ≤1.0 m was 0.32, and that &lt;3.0 m was 0.92. Groundline elevations were negatively related to tidal current velocity at the time of setting (p &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.33) and were closer to the seabed in deep than in shallow water (p &lt; 0.05, r2 = 0.07). It is suggested that groundlines in the Bay of Fundy may not constitute a large part of the risk associated with the entanglement of right whales, because most lines remained below the elevation hypothesized to be a threat (3 m). We also identified factors within the control of fishers setting trawls that minimize groundline elevations. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.

Previous genetic analysis of 218 whale bones from sixteenth century Basque whaling sites in the western North Atlantic revealed only a single right whale bone. We determined the genotypes of 27 microsatellite loci using DNA isolated from this bone. All alleles from the historic specimen occur in the extant western North Atlantic population and both the probability of identity of the specimen and the number of heterozygous loci are similar to that in the extant population. Assessments of how genetically different the historical population might have been suggest genetic characteristics have not changed substantially over four centuries of whaling. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Eubalaena glacialis; Genetic diversity; Population history; Species recovery; Whaling","allele; DNA; genetic analysis; genetic variation; historical ecology; human activity; population decline; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Trent University

This neurotoxin has been responsible for several mass mortality events involving marine birds and mammals. In all cases, the toxin was transferred from its algal producers through marine food webs by one or more intermediate vectors. The ability of some copepod taxa to serve as vectors for DA has been demonstrated; however, the role played in DA trophic transfer by Calanus finmarchicus, which often dominates N. Atlantic zooplankton assemblages and is a primary dietary component of the highly endangered N. Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), has been uncertain. In the present study, we examined the ability of C. finmarchicus to consume DA-producing algae and retain the toxin. Results of grazing and toxin accumulation/depuration experiments showed that C. finmarchicus consumed DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries regardless of the presence or absence of morphologically similar, but non-toxic, P. pungens, across initial cell concentrations ranging from 1000-4000 cells mL- 1. Furthermore, C. finmarchicus did not appear to preferentially consume or avoid either Pseudo-nitzschia species tested. After ingestion of P. multiseries, copepods accumulated DA and retained it for up to 48 h post-removal of the toxin source. These findings provide evidence for the potential of C. finmarchicus to facilitate DA trophic transfer in marine food webs where toxic Pseudo-nitzschia is present.","Calanus finmarchicus; Copepod; Copepod grazing; Domoic acid; Harmful algal blooms; Pseudo-nitzschia","alga; amino acid; crustacean; diatom; endangered species; food web; grazing; mass mortality; toxin; whale; zooplankton; algae; Aves; Bacillariophyta; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Pseudo-nitzschia; Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries",,,,,,"We would like to express our thanks to Drs.

This feeding process is enabled by extremely large skulls and mandibles that increase mouth area, thereby facilitating the flux of water into the mouth. When these mandibles are lowered during lunge-feeding, they are exposed to high drag, and therefore, may be subject to significant bending forces. We hypothesized that these mandibles exhibited a mechanical design (shape and density distribution) that enables these bones to accommodate high loads during lunge-feeding without exceeding their breaking strength. We used quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to determine the three-dimensional geometry and density distribution of a pair of subadult humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mandibles (length = 2.10 m). QCT data indicated highest bone density and cross-sectional area, and therefore, high resistance to bending and deflection, from the coronoid process to the middle of the dentary, which then decreased towards the anterior end of the mandible. These results differ from the caudorostral trends of increasing mandibular bone density in mammals, such as humans and the right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, indicating that adaptive bone remodeling is a significant contributing factor in establishing mandibular bone density distributions in rorquals. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Flexural rigidity; Lunge-feeding; Mandible; Quantitative computed tomography; Rorqual","article; biomechanics; bone density; bone remodeling; computer assisted tomography; feeding; female; humpback whale; mandible; nonhuman; priority journal; rigidity; anatomy and histology; animal; feeding behavior; humpback whale; mandible; mouth; physiology; radiography; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Density; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humpback Whale; Mandible; Mouth; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,,,,,,"Arnold, P.W., Birtles, R.A., Sobtzick, S., Matthews, M., Dunstan, A., Gulping behaviour in rorqual whales: Underwater observations and functional interpretation (2005) Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, 51 (2), pp. 309-332; Brodie, P.F., Noise generated by the jaw actions of feeding fin whales (1993) Can J Zool, 71, pp. 2546-2550; Brodie, P.K., Feeding mechanisms of rorquals (Balaenoptera sp.)
