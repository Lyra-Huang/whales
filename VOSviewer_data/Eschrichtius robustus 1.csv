Filadelfo et al. (this issue) compiled historical data on large-scale naval exercises and found significant correlations with whale mass strandings in some locations but not in others. In the present study, we compile information on Navy operations off southern California and single strandings of several cetacean species to see if there is a correlation between strandings and Navy exercises in this area. We use information on the state of decomposition of the stranded animals to treat the actual time of stranding as a random variable, and we simulate the correlation between Navy activity and strandings with a Monte Carlo model. For gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of odds of a stranding occurring as a result of Navy exercises to the odds of a stranding occurring naturally was (0.879, 1.582), consistent with the null hypothesis of no difference in stranding rates between times of Navy exercises and other times. For other species, the 95% CI for the odds ratio was (0.716, 1.394), which is, again, consistent with the null hypothesis.","Military sonar; Whale strandings","acoustic method; computer simulation; confidence interval; correlation; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; sonar; stranding; whale; California; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,,,"Cox, T.M., Ragen, T.J., Read, A.J., Vos, E., Baird, R.W., Balcomb, K., Understanding the impacts of anthropogenic sound on beaked whales (2006) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 7, pp. 177-187; D'Amico, A., Gisiner, R.C., Ketten, D.R., Hammock, J.A., Johnson, C., Tyack, P.L., Beaked whale strandings and naval exercises (2009) Aquatic Mammals, 35 (4), pp. 452-472; D'Spain, G.A., D'Amico, A.D., Fromm, D., Properties of underwater sound fields during some well documented beaked whale mass strandings (2006) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 7, pp. 223-238; Evans, D.L., England, G., (2001) Joint interim report: Bahamas marine mammal stranding event of 15-16 March 2000, , www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/stranding_bahamas2000.pdf, Retrieved 3 December 2009 from; Filadelfo, R., Mintz, J., Michlovich, E., D'Amico, A.D., Tyack, P.L., Ketten, D.R., Correlating military sonar use with beaked whale mass strandings: What do the historical data show?

Mammals require omega 6 fatty acids for reproduction. With this long exposure to the omega 3-rich marine food chain, the Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) might be expected to have lost its requirement for omega 6 fatty acids. We report an unexpectedly high content of omega 6 arachidonic acid (ArA) in the Gray whale liver and muscle lipids. This whale migrates 10,000 km from the cold polar, omega 3 oil-rich food chain to that of the breeding lagoons of the tropical waters. The food web of tropical waters is a source of omega 6 fatty acids, which are hardly present in the cold polar food web. We suggest the reason for this longest of migrations from cold to warm waters is to meet the requirement for omega 6 fatty acids for mammalian reproduction and brain growth. This extreme conservation of omega 6 fatty acids in Gray whale biology has critical implications for mammalian biology and especially for whale conservation. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Dolphins; Eco-physiology; Gray whale; Marine mammals; Migrations; Omega 3; Omega 6 fatty acids; Stable isotope","cell organelle; diet; ecophysiology; fatty acid; food chain; growth rate; migratory behavior; reproduction; stable isotope; whale; Ara; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Mya; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,,"Ackman, R.G., (1982) Nutritional evaluation of long-chain fatty acids in fish oil, pp. 25-88. , Barlow S.M., Stansby M.E.

Eschrichtius robustus) is the only living species in the family Eschrichtiidae. It is a slow-moving sturdy mysticete, slimmer than right whales and stockier than most rorquals. It attains a maximum length of 15.3 m (50 ft) and its skin is mottled light to dark gray with whitish blotches and heavily infested with barnacles and cyamids, or "" whale lice, "" especially on the head. Instead of a dorsal fin, the back has a hump followed by a series of fleshy knobs, or "" knuckles"" along the tailstock. The behavioral ecology of the gray whale is unique among mysticetes, as it is the most coastal; makes the longest migration; calves in warm bays, lagoons, and coastal areas; and is an intermittent suction feeder that regularly forages on benthos, apart from feeding opportunistically on plankton and nekton by gulping and skimming. Once found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, the gray whale became extinct in the Atlantic and now is a relict species confined to the productive neritic and estuarine waters of the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters of the Arctic Ocean. The eastern population (also called the American , California , or Chukchi stock) occurs in the eastern North Pacific and Amerasian Arctic Oceans, whereas the remnant western population (also called the Asian , Korean , or Okhotsk stock ) occurs in the western North Pacific (off Asia). The western gray whale is now a remnant population close to extinction that occurs off Russia, Japan, Korea, and China and is one of the most critically endangered populations of whales. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of both space and time is often required, but few spatial-temporal analysis methods are available. Here we demonstrate combining an advanced spatial analysis approach, kernel density estimation, with a novel temporal analysis method, the space time string, to quantify spatial-temporal patterns in marine wildlife. Using a data set on gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) foraging from Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada, we identify spatial-temporal trends in foraging and relate them to prey population dynamics. Results suggest two types of between year spatial-temporal patterns: prey in equilibrium and severe disturbance. By demonstrating the theory, implementation, and interpretation of advanced methods, we provide marine researchers with approaches applicable to a variety of research questions.","Gray whale; Spatial analysis; Spatial-temporal patterns",,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, T., Gatrell, A., (1995) Interactive Spatial Data Analysis, 414p. , Essex: Longman Group Limited; Boots, B., Local measures of spatial association (2002) Ecoscience, 9, pp. 168-176; Coyle, K.O., Bluhm, B.A., Konar, B., Blanchard, A.L., Highsmith, R., Amphipod prey of gray whales in the northern bering sea: Comparison of biomass and distribution between the 1980s and 2002-2003 Progress in Oceanography, , (In press); Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Foraging patterns of gray whales in central clayoquot sound, BC, Canada (2001) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 223, pp. 229-310; Dunham, J.S., Duffus, D.A., Diet of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in clayoquot sound, British columbia, Canada (2002) Marine Mammal Science, 18, pp. 419-437; Fortin, M.J., Dale, M.R.T., (2005) Spatial Analysis: A Guide for Ecologists, 380p. , Cambridge: University Press; Fotheringham, A.S., Trends in quantitative methods III: Stressing the visual (1999) Progress in Human Geography, 23, pp. 597-606; Fotheringham, A.S., Brunsdon, C., Charlton, M., (2000) Quantitative Geography: Perspectives of Spatial Data Analysis, , London: Sage Publications, Ch. 4; Gahegan, M., The case for inductive and visual techniques in the analysis of spatial data (2000) Journal of Geographical System, 2, pp. 77-83; Jenrich, R.I., Turner, F.B., Measurement of non-circular home range (1969) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 22, pp. 227-237; Kelsall, J., Diggle, P., Non-parametric estimation of spatial variation in relative risk (1995) Statistics in Medicine, 14, pp. 2335-2342; Meliker, J.R., Slotnick, M.J., Avruskin, G.A., Kaufmann, A.M., Jacquez, G.M., Nriagu, J.O., Improving exposure assessment in environmental assessment in environmental epidemiology: Application of spatio-temporal visualization tools (2005) Journal of Geographical Systems, 7, pp. 49-66; Nelson, T.A., Duffus, D., Robertson, C., Feyrer, L.J., Spatial-temporal patterns in intra-annual gray whale foraging: Characterizing interactions between predators and prey (2008) Marine Mammal Science, 24 (2), pp. 356-370; Potvin, F., Boots, B., Dempsters, A., Comparison among three approaches to evaluate winter habitat selection by white-tailed deer on anticosti island using occurrences from an aerial survey and forest vegetation maps (2003) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 81, pp. 1662-1670; Righton, D., Mills, C., Application of GIS to investigate the use of space in coral reef fish: A comparison of territorial behaviour in two red sea butterflyfishes (2006) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 20, pp. 215-232; Seaman, D.E., Powell, R.A., An evaluation of the accuracy of kernel density estimators for home range analysis (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 2075-2085; Shi, H., Laurent, E.J., Lebouton, J., Racevskis, L., Hall, K.R., Donovan, M., Doepker, R.V., Liu, J., Local spatial modeling of white-tailed deer distribution (2006) Ecological Modelling, 190, pp. 171-189; Worton, B.J., Kernel methods for estimating the utilization distribution in home-range studies (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 164-168; Worton, B.J., A convex hull-based estimator of home-range size (1995) Biometrics, 51, pp. 1205-1216","Spatial Pattern Analysis and Research Laboratory, Department of Geography, University of Victoria, PO Box 3060, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",,,,,,,,07490208,,JCRSE,,"English","J.

Cetaceans include approximately 84 species. They are a diverse group. They range in size from less than 1 m long for a newborn vaquita (. Phocoena sinus), to 33 m in an adult blue whale (. Balaenoptera musculus); they occupy water ranging in temperature from -2°C to over 30°C; they exhibit a diverse array of life history strategies. Consider the sperm whale (. Physeter macrocephalus), which can remain beneath the water for over an hour and dive to depths of several thousand meters; the Ganges river dolphin (. Platanista gangetica), which inhabits fresh water so turbid it is functionally blind; beaked whales of the genus Mesoplodon, which are so pelagic and so elusive that some have never been seen alive in the wild; the gray whale (. Eschrichtius robustus), which annually migrates some 15,000 to 20,000 km between breeding and feeding areas; and the bowhead whale (. Balaena mysticetus), which uses its rostrum to break ice in the Arctic. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When it is difficult to estimate absolute abundance with an acceptably low bias, relative abundance indices are often used instead. These are indices that are believed to be proportional to population size, apart from stochastic variation, allowing trends in the population in space and/or time to be assessed. The main techniques for abundance estimation (relative or absolute) are distance sampling, mark-recapture, migration counts, and colony counts. Many populations of large whales conveniently file past coastal watch points on migration, allowing observers to count a large proportion of the population. This count can then be corrected for animals passing outside watch periods to estimate population size. The methods usually used for modeling migration counts were developed for the analysis of surveys of the California gray whale (. Eschrichtius robustus). In colony count abundance estimation researchers often make counts of populations when they gather for breeding and pupping at certain times of the year. Often photographs are taken of the colonies. These are brought back to the laboratory for analysis and form a permanent record of the population. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Their distribution varies according to the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the water masses they use. The effects of oceanographic phenomena, wind-induced movements (e.g., water currents, local divergence, upwelling areas and water fronts, and thermocline depth), and the topography can be used to characterize distribution. In marine environments, distribution can be generally described as coastal (in estuarine or near shore waters), neritic (in waters on the continental shelf), or oceanic (in waters beyond the continental slope, in the open seas or oceans). Examples of marine mammals that reside primarily in coastal waters are populations of bottlenose dolphins (. Tursiops spp.), sea otters (. Enhydra lutris), and dugongs (. Dugong dugon). Primarily neritic species include gray whales (. Eschrichtius robustus), harbor porpoise (. Phocoena phocoena), and California sea lions (. Zalophus californianus). Primarily oceanic species include the sperm whale (. Physeter macrocephalus) and beaked whales (family Ziphiidae). Marine mammal distribution can also be classified according to general geographic areas. These are characterized by latitudinal bands and average water temperatures. Thus, marine mammals have tropical and/or subtropical, temperate, Antarctic, or Arctic distributions. Some species can be strictly included in just one of these categories. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It can be for scientific, educational, and/or recreational purposes. The wide variety of whale watching activities includes tours lasting from 1 h to 2 weeks, using platforms ranging from kayaks to cruise ships, from land points including cliffs and beaches, from sea planes and helicopters in the air, as well as swimming and diving activities in which the whale watcher enters the water with cetaceans. Whale watching grew out of the traditions of bird watching and, to a lesser extent, other forms of land-based wildlife watching. The species originally responsible for the development of whale watching was the gray whale (. Eschrichtius robustus). Whale watching for the purposes of research can be traced back to Aristotle, who spent time on boats and with fishermen in the Aegean Sea. A successful partnership between science and commercial whale watching began in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1975, when Al Avellar of the Dolphin fleet asked Charles ""Stormy"" Mayo to be his naturalist. This key partnership between science and commerce has determined the course of whale watching, as well as the practice of whale research, throughout southern New England. Despite the competitive atmosphere of commercial whale watching in New England, the researchers and their representative institutions have cooperated in setting up the North Atlantic Humpback Whale Catalog, which is a photo catalog and database covering more than 10,000 individual whales. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In 2006 more focus was placed on the nearshore region seaward of Chayvo spit where whales were sighted for the first time at depths 12-15m. During the 5 years of observation in Offshore area, utilization by gray whales varied. Significant numbers of whales were observed in the Offshore area in 2002 and 2003. Abundance of gray whale was recorded much lower in 2004 and 2005. From 2002-2006, 63 whales were identified in both the Offshore and Piltun areas both in the same year and in different years. © 2009, Asian Fisheries Society.

Most eastern gray whales return to their major breeding range each winter along the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico, concentrating in 3 major calving lagoons, but it is unknown whether genetic differences exist between lagoons. Previous photo-identification studies and genetic studies suggest that gray whales may return to their natal lagoons to breed, potentially resulting in the buildup of genetic differences. However, an earlier genetic study used only one genetic marker and did not include samples from Bahia Magdalena, a major calving lagoon not currently designated as a wildlife refuge. To expand on this previous study, we collected genetic data from the mitochondrial control region (442 bp) and 9 microsatellite markers from 112 individuals across all 3 major calving lagoons. Our data suggest that migration rates between calving lagoons are high but that a small but significant departure from panmixia exists between Bahia Magdalena and Laguna San Ignacio (Fisher's Exact test, P &lt; 0.0001; FST = 0.006, P = 0.025). Coalescent simulations show that the lack of extensive population structure may result from the disruption of structure due to whaling. Another possibility is that rates of migration have always been high (&gt;10% per generation). In addition, microsatellite data showed evidence of a severe population bottleneck. Eastern gray whales are still recovering from the impacts of whaling on their breeding grounds, and these populations should be protected and monitored for future genetic changes. © The American Genetic Association. 2008.

Thus, examining the magnitude of such anthropogenic interactions using a scar-based approach is warranted. A multi-year (1995-2005) photo-identification study of western gray whales on their feeding ground off northeastern Sakhalin Island, Russia, has resulted in a large data set of digital and film images of 150 individuals. These images were reviewed and scored for anthropogenic scarring by recording the presence of visible scars resulting from fishing gear entanglement and vessel collisions in 21 defined body regions. In total, 20.0% (n = 30) of whales identified during the study period had detectable anthropogenic scarring, with 18.7% (n = 28) determined to have been previously entangled in fishing gear at least once and 2.0% (n = 3) to have survived at least one vessel collision. These estimates are likely to be conservative given the nature of the photo-identification data set, but indicate that male and female western gray whales are subject to anthropogenic interactions. Future studies designed to systematically estimate the frequency and rates of anthropogenic events are needed and would have direct conservation and management implications. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Anthropogenic scarring; Entanglement; Eschrichtius robustus; Photo-identification; Species conservation; Vessel collision; Western gray whale","anthropogenic effect; endangered species; feeding ground; handling stress; human activity; identification method; photography; whale; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.R., Duffus, D.A., Langelier, K.M., An evaluation of gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) mortality incidental to fishing operations in British Columbia, Canada (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 289-296. , and; Bradford, A.L., Wade, P.R., Weller, D.W., Burdin, A.M., Ivashchenko, Y.V., Tsidulko, G.A., Vanblaricom, G.R., Brownell Jr., R.L., Survival estimates of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus incorporating individual heterogeneity and temporary emigration (2006) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 315, pp. 293-307. , and; Bradford, A.L., Weller, D.W., Wade, P.R., Burdin, A.M., Brownell Jr., R.L., Population abundance and growth rate of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus (2008) Endangered Species Research, 16, pp. 1-14. , and; Brownell Jr., R.L., Chun, C., Probable existence of the Korean stock of the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) (1977) Journal of Mammalogy, 58, pp. 237-239. , and; Burdin, A.M., Tsidulko, G.A., Ivashchenko, Y.V., Bradford, A.L., Weller, D.W., (2002) Photo-identification of Western Gray Whales in Coastal and Offshore Sakhalin Shelf Waters, , http://www.iwcoffice.org/, and.

This unusual marine mammal stranding event was clustered from April to June and consisted primarily of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and long-beaked common dolphins {Delphinus capensis) with severe neurologic signs. Intoxication with domoic acid (DA), a marine neurotoxin produced during seasonal blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp., was suspected. Definitively linking harmful algal blooms to large-scale marine mammal mortalities presents a substantial challenge, as does determining the geographic extent, species composition, and potential population impacts of marine mammal die-offs. For this reason, time series cross-correlation analysis was performed to test the temporal correlations of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms with standings occurring along the southern California coastline. Temporal correlations were identified between strandings and blooms for California sea lions, long-beaked common dolphins, and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). Similar correlations were identified for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), but small sample sizes for these species made associations more speculative. The timing of the blooms and strandings of marine mammals suggested that both inshore and offshore foraging species were affected and that marine biotoxin programs should include offshore monitoring sites. In addition, California sea lionstrandings appear to be a very sensitive indicator of DA in the marine environment, and their monitoring should be included in public health surveillance plans. © 2009 Wildlife Disease Association.","California sea lion; Common dolphin; Domoic acid toxicity; Harmful algal blooms; Marine mammal strandings; Pseudo-nitzschia spp","algae; Cetacea; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Pseudo-nitzschia; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus; Zalophus; Zalophus californianus; domoic acid; drug derivative; kainic acid; marine toxin; neurotoxin; animal; animal disease; article; brain disease; chemically induced disorder; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; female; food chain; intoxication; male; mortality; seal; season; United States; Animals; Brain Diseases; California; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Female; Food Chain; Kainic Acid; Male; Marine Toxins; Mortality; Neurotoxins; Poisoning; Sea Lions; Seasons",,"domoic acid, 14277-97-5; kainic acid, 487-79-6; neurotoxin, 39386-17-9; Kainic Acid, 487-79-6; Marine Toxins; Neurotoxins; domoic acid, 14277-97-5",,,,,,,"Barcu, S., Powell, C.L., Coale, S.L., Busman, M., Doucette, G.J., Silver, M.W., Krill: A potential vector for domoic acid in marine food webs (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 237, pp. 209-216; Bates, S.S., Domoic-acid-producing diatoms: Another genus added (2000) Journal of Phycology, 36, pp. 978-985; Garrison, D.L., Horner, R.A., Bloom dynamics and physiology of domoic-acidproducing Pseudo-nitzschia species (1998) Physiological Ecology of Harmful, Algal, Blooms, pp. 267-292. , D.

Along their migration route and in their feeding grounds these whales are exposed to high levels of ambient noise, highly turbid waters and many underwater obstacles. To test possible passive acoustic localization mechanisms (e.g. Acoustic Daylight Imaging and Passive Synthetic Aperture), we made extensive acoustic measurements during comprehensive field studies of these whales on their summer feeding grounds in British Columbia (Canada). In combination with visual observations of the whales and their behaviours, we investigated the acoustical sources available to the whales when navigating within a feeding bay. First, we measured ambient noise levels to construct the acoustic landscape around the whales. Second, we investigated how sound is altered when objects such as kelp beds and rocks are present. We also measured acoustic changes induced by direct, controlled modifications of the near-shore environment. The aim of this research is to understand how grey whales might be finding their way around, and what impact, if any, increased levels of ambient noise might have on the whales' ability to find food and navigate within the feeding grounds.",,"Acoustic measurements; Acoustical sources; British Columbia; Controlled modification; Eastern pacific; Passive acoustics; Shallow water environment; Visual observations; Feeding; Acoustic noise",,,,,,,,,"Braham, H.W., Migration and distribution of gray whales in alaskan (1984) The Gray Whale, pp. 249-266. , M.L.

In this study, teams of shore-based observers independently tracked whale pods during the southbound migration of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) while a routine (""standard watch"") census was underway. A comparison of sighting records showed that time and location accuracy was limited to 45 s, 3° (magnetic) horizontally, and 0.0057° (0.2 reticles) vertically. Of 242 attempts to track whale groups, 72 failed, 120 were ""good tracks,"" and 83 qualified as ""best tracks"" because they had ≥8 sightings/pod, ≥16-min observation time, and unequivocal matches to sightings in the standard watch during uncompromised visibility. Between paired tracking teams, 39 attempts to conduct concurrent tracks resulted in 21 ""good tracks"" with complete agreement in 71% of the cases. Of 133 comparisons between trackers and the standard watch, 43% of the pod-size estimates were the same, but the standard watch overestimated 10% of the pods and underestimated 47%. Thus, according to results from tracking teams, pods recorded as size 1 by observers on the standard watch should be corrected by +0.6; pods of 2 by +0.5; pods of 3 by +0.8; and pods >3 (4-10) were overestimated and should be corrected by -0.6.","Counting accuracy; Eschrichtius robustus; Shore-based gray whale counts; Sighting records; Whale census","accuracy assessment; census; comparative study; migratory species; tracking; visibility; whale; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Buckland, S.T., Breiwick, J.M., Cattanach, K.L., Laake, J.L., Estimated population size of the California gray whale (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 235-249. , and; Deangelis, M.L., Martin, T., Perryman, W.L., (1997) Pod Size Estimates Studied Through Thermal Sensors, , and.

Recent studies of this population off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, have produced a photographic dataset that was utilized for the first mark-recapture assessment of western gray whale abundance. Given encounter histories of 129 individually identified whales spanning 25 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2003, a closed capture estimator was employed to estimate the number of individuals using the study area in each year. Temporary emigration probabilities were then applied to the closed capture estimates to enumerate the total population size of whales off northeastern Sakhalin Island. Total abundances from 1997 to 2003 were estimated as 64 ± 5.1 (SE), 55 to 75 (95% CI); 75 ± 4.9, 66 to 85; 86 ± 3.1, 80 to 93; 77 ± 4.7, 68 to 87; 91 ± 3.4, 84 to 98; 98 ± 4.1, 90 to 106; and 99 ± 4.9, 90 to 109, respectively. These abundance estimates, particularly the last values in the series, most likely approximate the size of the entire western gray whale population. For comparison to the trend in the abundance estimates, life history data were used to estimate the growth rate of the population. Depending on the range of potential fecundity values incorporated, the resulting growth rate estimates indicate an annual population increase that is between 2.5 and 3.2%. The extremely small population size and slow rate of increase documented here further highlight concern about the viability of this critically endangered population. © Inter-Research 2008.","Abundance; Mark-recapture; Photo-identification; Population growth rate Simulation approach; Sakhalin Island, Russia; Temporary emigration; Western gray whale","abundance; endangered species; fecundity; mark-recapture method; migration; population growth; population size; whale; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , Petrov BN, Csaki F eds, Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, p; Japanese nets threaten grey whale's survival (2007) Nature, 445, p. 577. , Anonymous; Berzin, A.A., (1990) Gray whales of the Okhotsk-Korean population in the Sea of Okhotsk, , www.iwcoffice.org/publications/pubmain.htm, Paper SC/A90/G28 presented to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee.

We examined 130 records (from 1980-2006) of large whale strandings in Washington State. Nineteen strandings (seven species) had evidence of ship-strikes. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) had the highest incidence of ante-mortem ship strike (five of seven, with the remaining two possibly post-mortem) and all but one occurring since 2002. Six grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) suffered 'possible ship strike' injuries, likely the result of their large numbers in the area, rather than high levels of ship strikes. Only one possible ship-struck humpback whale was recorded, despite concentrations of humpbacks feeding within shipping lanes in this region. This study shows dramatic differences in occurrences of ship-struck large whales by species, which we believe results from a combination of species' vulnerability to ship strikes, and how likely a struck whale is to be caught up on the bow of a ship and brought to waters where it can be examined. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Balaenoptera physalus; Grey whale; Immature fin whale; Ship strike; Stranding; Washington State","anthropogenic effect; community response; marine record; mortality; species occurrence; stranding; vulnerability; whale; North America; United States; Washington [United States]; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera",,,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Lockyer, C.H., Growth, physical maturity, and mortality of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) inhabiting the temperate waters of the northeast Atlantic (1987) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 65, pp. 253-264; Allison, P.A., Smith, C.R., Kukert, H., Deming, J.W., Bennett, B.A., Deep-water taphonomy of vertebrate carcasses: A whale skeleton in the bathyal Santa Catalina Basin (1991) Paleobiology, 17, pp. 78-89; Andre M., Terada M. and Watanabe Y.

In this region, gray whales were found to feed primarily on planktonic prey rather than on the benthos as in their primary feeding areas further north. During the summers of 1999 and 2000, whales spent most of their time actively feeding or searching for prey (77%), whereas only 15% of their time was spent traveling and 8% socializing. The majority of the dives were short; the mean dive duration was 2.24 min with approximately three respirations per surfacing and 15 s between blows. Whales dove frequently (26.7 h-1), spending only 17% of their time at the surface with an overall blow rate of 1.14 respirations per minute. Activity states were characterized by significantly different diving and respiratory parameters; feeding whales dove more frequently, with shorter intervals between respirations, thus spending less time at the surface compared to when traveling or searching. This diving pattern differs from benthic-feeding whales and likely optimizes capture of the mobile mysid swarms in shallow waters. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Activity budget; Behavioral ecology; Diving; Eschrichtius robustus; Foraging; Gray whale; Mysids; Mysticete","activity pattern; bay; behavioral ecology; benthos; comparative study; crustacean; diving behavior; feeding ground; planktivore; prey capture; prey location; respiration; whale; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Queen Charlotte Strait; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida",,,,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) The Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1747-1753. , and; Calambokidis, J., Darling, J.D., Deecke, V., Gearin, P., Gosho, M., Megill, W., Tombach, C.M., Gisborne, B., Abundance, range and movements of a feeding aggregation of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) from California to southeastern Alaska in 1998 (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 267-276. , and; Clarke, J.T., Moore, S.E., Ljungblad, D.K., Observations on gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) utilization patterns in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, July-October 1982-1987 (1989) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 67, pp. 2646-2654. , and; Costa, D.P., Williams, T.M., Marine mammal energetics (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals., pp. 176-217. , and.

Overall, the planet is warming, sea ice and glaciers are in retreat, sea level is rising, and pollutants are accumulating in the environment and within organisms. These clear physical changes undoubtedly affect marine ecosystems. Species dependent on sea ice, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the ringed seal (Phoca hispida), provide the clearest examples of sensitivity to climate change. Responses of cetaceans to climate change are more difficult to discern, but in the eastern North Pacific evidence is emerging that gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are delaying their southbound migration, expanding their feeding range along the migration route and northward to Arctic waters, and even remaining in polar waters over winter - all indications that North Pacific and Arctic ecosystems are in transition. To use marine mammals as sentinels of ecosystem change, we must expand our existing research strategies to encompass the decadal and ocean-basin temporal and spatial scales consistent with their natural histories. © 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.","Climate change; Marine ecosystems; Marine mammals; Seals; Sentinels; Whales","arctic environment; bear; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; glacier retreat; marine ecosystem; migration route; range expansion; sea ice; sea level change; sensitivity analysis; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,,,"AGUIRRE, A.A., TABOR, G.M., Introduction: Marine vertebrates as sentinels of marine ecosystem health (2004) EcoHealth, 1, pp. 236-238; BOERSMA, P.D., (2008) Penguins as marine sentinels, , BioScience; BOND, N.A., HARRISON, D.E., The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, air-sea interactions and central North Pacific winter atmospheric regimes (2000) Geophysical Research Letters, 27, pp. 731-734; BONDE, R.K., AGUIRRE, A.A., POWELL, J., (2004) Manatees as sentinels of marine ecosystem health: Are they the 2000-pound canaries?

University Avenue, Laramie, WY 82071, United States","Feeding by gray whales Eschrichtius robustus along the eastern Pacific coast between the Bering Sea and Baja, Mexico, appears to be increasing. Gray whale feeding can disturb large fractions of intertidal and shallow subtidal sediments, altering the distributions of benthic invertebrates for many months. Increased gray whale feeding may be modifying foraging profitability for other bottom-feeding vertebrates along the coast, but such effects have not been documented. This paper is the first report of a feeding association between a cetacean and bottom-feeding birds, namely a migrating gray whale and diving sea ducks. Local counts and condition of surf scoters Melanitta perspicillata in Puget Sound, Washington, suggest that gray whale feeding can provide important foraging opportunities for scoters during spring, when other foods may have declined and requirements to prepare for migration and reproduction are high. Complementary data are needed to evaluate the importance to scoters of this seasonal interaction with gray whales. However, given the large and protracted impacts of gray whales on benthic communities, our observations suggest that whale feeding may have increasing influence on the foraging patterns and trophic relations of a range of bottom-feeding vertebrates. © Inter-Research 2008.","Benthic-feeding; Birds; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding association; Gray whale; Melanitta spp.; Scoters","benthivory; community composition; feeding behavior; foraging behavior; seabird; whale; Bering Sea; Mexico [North America]; North America; Pacific Ocean; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]; Anas; Aves; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata; Melanitta; Melanitta perspicillata; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,,"Afton, A.D., Ankney, C.D., Nutrient-reserve dynamics of breeding lesser scaup: A test of competing hypotheses (1991) Condor, 93, pp. 89-97; Alter, S.E., Rynes, E., Palumbi, S.R., DNA evidence for historic population size and past ecosystem impacts of gray whales (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 15162-15167; Angliss, R.P., Outlaw, R.B., Alaska marine mammal stock assessments, 2006 (2007) NOAA Tech Memo, 168, pp. 141-150; Calambokidis, J., Schlender, S., Gosho, M., Gearin, P., Goley, D., Toropova, C., (2000) Gray whale photographic identification in 1999: Collaborative research by Cascadia Research, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, and Humboldt State University, , Cascadia Research CoUective, Olympia, WA; Calambokidis, J., Darling, J.D., Deecke, V., Gearin, P., and others, Abundance, range and movements of a feeding aggregation of gray whales Eschrichtius robustus from California to southeastern Alaska in 1998 (2002) J Cetacean Res Manag, 4, pp. 267-276; Calambokidis, J., Gosho, M., Gearin, P., Darling, J.D., and others, (2002) Gray whale photographic identification in 2001: Collaborative research in the Pacific Northwest, , Cascadia Research Collective, Olympia, WA; Darling, J.D., Keogh, K.E., Steeves, T.E., Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) habitat utUization and prey species off Vancouver Island, B.C (1998) Mar Mamm Sci, 14, pp. 692-720; Evans, P.G.H., Associations between seabirds and cetaceans: A review (1982) Mamm Rev, 12, pp. 187-206; Grebmeier, J.M., Harrison, N.M., Seabird feeding on benthic amphipods facilitated by gray whale activity in the northern Bering Sea (1992) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 80, pp. 125-133; Harrison, C.S., The association of marine birds and feeding gray whales (1979) Condor, 81, pp. 93-95; Highsmith, R.C., Coyle, K.O., Bluhm, B.A., Konar, B., Gray whales in the Bering and Chukchi Seas (2006) Whales, whaling and ocean ecosystems, pp. 303-313. , Estes JA, Demaster DP, Doak DF, Williams TM, Brownell RL Jr eds, University of California Press, Santa Cruz, p; Johnson KR, Nelson CH (1984) Side-scan sonar assessment of gray whale feeding in the Bering Sea.

The holotype is from the Early Pliocene of north-east Italy. It represents a fossil mysticete closely related to the living grey whale, Eschrichtius robustus. Comparative morphology and phylogenetic analysis support the monophyly of Eschrichtiidae and Cetotherium-like mysticetes and a sister group relationship between this clade and Balaenopteridae. Eschrichtiid fossils previously described are all from the Pleistocene and Late Pliocene while Eschrichtioides gastaldii is from the Early Pliocene. The recognition of this new eschrichtiid genus suggests that the Mediterranean trophic web of the Early Pliocene was more complex than at present and that the Neogene mysticete family-level biodiversity of the Mediterranean was higher than that currently observed in this basin. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.","Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtioides gastaldii; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding adaptations; Grey whale","Balaenoptera; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysticeti; Zanclea",,,,,,,,,"Baker, A.N., Pygmy right whale - Caperea marginata (1985) Handbook of Marine Mammals, 3, pp. 345-355. , In: Ridgway, S.M., Harrison, R., eds.

From December 2004 to May 2005, whales were followed using a theodolite to determine swimming velocity. Binoculars were used to count whale blows and their timings were recorded to determine breathing rates. Individual whale breathing rates (BR) were divided by their swimming velocity (V) to derive a comparative index of swimming effort in units of breaths per kilometre. There were significant differences in mean BR, V, and swimming effort among the three migrating groups (p &lt; 0.05). Southbound migrating whales averaged a swimming effort of 7.4 breaths·-km-1 (V = 1.9 m·s-1, BR = 0.8 breaths·min-1). Northbound whales without calves showed the lowest swimming effort of the three migrating groups (4.7 breaths·km -1, V = 1.8 m·s-1, BR = 0.5 breaths·min -1). Northbound mothers and calves had the same swimming velocity (V = 1.2 m·s-1), but BR and swimming effort were calculated separately yielding a swimming effort of 7.6 breaths·km-1 (BR = 0.5 breaths·min-1) for mothers and 10.1 breaths· km-1 (BR = 0.7 breaths·min-1) for calves. Cost of transport was calculated for northbound calves, yielding a range based on 1.5% and 3% tidal volumes of 0.25-0.34 and 0.51-0.58 J·kg -1·m-1, respectively. © 2008 NRC.",,"bioenergetics; comparative study; metabolism; migratory population; neonate; optical instrument; swimming; velocity profile; whale; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; North America; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine mammals: Evolutionary biology, , Academic Press, San Diego; Bose, N., Lien, J., Energy absorption from ocean waves: A free ride for cetaceans (1990) Proc.

In this paper we characterize the interactions of gray whales and their prey by analyzing fine scale spatial-temporal patterns in foraging gray whale distribution within a season. Kernel density estimators are applied to two seasons (1998 and 2002) of high-resolution data on foraging by gray whales. By partitioning data from each foraging season into several time periods (12 in 1998 and 11 in 2002), using a temporal autocorrelation function, and generating kernel density estimated surfaces for each time period, it is possible to identify discrete areas of increasing and declining foraging effort. Our results indicate that gray whales forage on mysids throughout a season and opportunistically forage on crab larvae. The episodic crab larvae feeding may reduce, but not eliminate, pressure to mysid populations enabling mysids to reassemble swarms and continue to support gray whale foraging in the latter part of the season. Results suggest that when managing marine environments, gray whale populations require multiple and connected habitats for summer foraging. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Change detection; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Kernel density estimation; Predator-prey interactions; Spatial pattern analysis; Spatial-temporal patterns; Whale foraging","annual variation; connectivity; crab; crustacean; feeding; foraging behavior; predator-prey interaction; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; whale; British Columbia; Canada; Clayoquot Sound; North America; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysida; Porcellanidae",,,,,,,,,"Bowman, A., Azzalini, A., (1997) Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis: The Kernel Approach., , and.

So stated Felix Cohen in his seminal article, The Erosion of Indian Rights (1953). It is through Cohen's lens that we examine the domestic and international controversy over the resumption of whaling by the Makah Indian Nation following the recovery of the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus or “California gray whale”). The controversy raises issues of considerable significance: treaty obligations, subsistence and cultural rights versus majoritarianism, contested conservation assessments, animal rights, and politics within multilateral environmental institutions. We explore these issues independently of our personal views about whaling. Although we support the Makah Tribe's right to decide for itself whether to engage in subsistence whaling, we reject the label “pro-whaling.” We likewise do not reflexively label all of those who come to a different conclusion than we do with the pejorative label “anti-indigenous” or “anti-Indian.” We fully recognize that principled people may weigh the interests at hand and come to different conclusions. The aim of this article is thus broader than the Makah and whales. © IUCN Academy of Environmental Law 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cohen, F.S., The Erosion of Indian Rights, 1950-1953 (1953) Yale L.

The significance of killer whale Orcinus orca predation on baleen whales (Mysticeti) has been a topic of considerable discussion and debate in recent years. Discourse has been constrained by poor understanding of predator-prey dynamics, including the relative vulnerability of different mysticete species and age classes to killer whales and how these prey animals avoid predation. Here we provide an overview and analysis of predatory interactions between killer whales and mysticetes, with an emphasis on patterns of antipredator responses. 2. Responses of baleen whales to predatory advances and attacks by killer whales appear to fall into two distinct categories, which we term the fight and flight strategies. The fight strategy consists of active physical defence, including self-defence by single individuals, defence of calves by their mothers and coordinated defence by groups of whales. It is documented for five mysticetes: southern right whale Eubalaena australis, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. The flight strategy consists of rapid (20-40 km/ h) directional swimming away from killer whales and, if overtaken and attacked, individuals do little to defend themselves. This strategy is documented for six species in the genus Balaenoptera. 3. Many aspects of the life history, behaviour and morphology of mysticetes are consistent with their antipredator strategy, and we propose that evolution of these traits has been shaped by selection for reduced predation. Fight species tend to have robust body shapes and are slow but relatively manoeuvrable swimmers. They often calve or migrate in coastal areas where proximity to shallow water provides refuge and an advantage in defence. Most fight species have either callosities (rough and hardened patches of skin) or encrustations of barnacles on their bodies, which may serve (either primarily or secondarily) as weapons or armour for defence. Flight species have streamlined body shapes for high-speed swimming and they can sustain speeds necessary to outrun pursuing killer whales (>15-20 km/h). These species tend to favour pelagic habitats and calving grounds where prolonged escape sprints from killer whales are possible. 4. The rarity of observed successful attacks by killer whales on baleen whales, especially adults, may be an indication of the effectiveness of these antipredator strategies. Baleen whales likely offer low profitability to killer whales, relative to some other marine mammal prey. High-speed pursuit of flight species has a high energetic cost and a low probability of success while attacks on fight species can involve prolonged handling times and a risk of serious injury. © Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.","Cetacean; Defence; Killer whale; Orcinus orca; Predation; Predator avoidance","antipredator defense; marine mammal; morphology; pelagic environment; predation; predator-prey interaction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Orcinus orca; Thoracica",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea I.

Whale counts per 10-min scan (an index of relative abundance) ranged from 0 to 41 in June and from 0 to 28 in September. CTD data showed an ocean front around 67.8°N with strong horizontal gradients in temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a concentration and water-column stability. Highest whale abundance indices occurred in or near the front in both periods. Preliminary qualitative assessment of biological communities in the study area suggests that infaunal clams, echinoderms, euphausids, chaetognaths and Arctic cod were common, while ampeliscid amphipods, the previously abundant infauna (and likely prey) in the nearby Chirikov Basin feeding area, were not dominant. Euphausids may be a prey for gray whales in this area. We suggest that frontal systems may play an important role in eastern North Pacific gray whale foraging grounds.

Information from the 1980s benthic investigations, published accounts of ENP gray whale population trends and the occurrence in 1999-2000 of an unusual number of gray whale mortalities prompted concern that the whale population may have exceeded the carrying capacity of its food base. Therefore, during two cruises per year between June and September, 2002 and 2003, we resampled the 20 stations occupied during the 1980s, to determine if there had been any significant changes in ampeliscid abundance and biomass. During 2002-2003, average ampeliscid dry weight biomass was about 28±10 g m-2 (95% confidence interval), a decline of nearly 50% from maximum values in the 1980s. Amphipod length measurements indicated that the declines were due mainly to the absence of the larger animals (20-30 mm length). Two hypotheses were considered regarding the amphipod declines: gray whale predation and climate. Ampeliscid production (105 kcal m-2 yr-1) and gray whale energy requirements (1.6×108 kcal individual-1 yr-1) indicated that as little as 3-6% of the current estimate of the ENP gray whale population could remove 10-20% of the annual ampeliscid production from the study site in 2002-2003, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that top-down control by foraging whales was the primary cause of the observed declines. A 10-yr time series of temperature near the bottom in the Bering Strait and northward transport did not reveal a consistent trend between 1990 and 2001, suggesting that climate influences were not the major cause of the observed declines. Arctic ampeliscids have slow growth rates and long generation times; therefore the ampeliscid community may require decades to recover to densities observed in the 1980s.

DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG) on behalf of the Sakhalin-1 consortium conducted a 3-D seismic survey of the Odoptu license area during 17 August-9 September 2001. A portion of the primary feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located in the vicinity of the seismic survey. This paper presents data to assess whether western gray whale bottom feeding activity, as indicated by visible mud plumes, was affected by seismic operations. The mitigation and monitoring program associated with the seismic survey included aerial surveys during 19 July-19 November 2001. These aerial surveys documented the local and regional distribution, abundance, and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales. Data on gray whale feeding activity before, during and after the seismic survey were collected, with the whales assumed to be feeding on the benthos if mud plumes were observed on the surface. The data were used to assess the influence of seismic survey and other factors (including environmental) on feeding activity of western gray whales. A stepwise multiple regression analysis failed to find a statistically significant effect (α=0.05) of the seismic survey on frequency of occurrence of mud plumes of western gray whales used as a proxy to evaluate bottom feeding activity in Piltun feeding area. The regression indicated that transect number (a proxy for water depth, related to distance from shore) and swell height (a proxy for sea state) were the only variables that had a significant effect on frequency of whale mud plumes. It is concluded that the 2001 seismic survey had no measurable effect (α=0.05) on bottom feeding activity of western gray whales off Sakhalin Island. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Air gun; Continental shelf; Environment; Feeding activity; Mud plume; Multiple regression; Odoptu; Oil; Sakhalin Island; Seismic survey; Western gray whales","Environmental impact assessments; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Seismology; Statistics; Surveys; Multiple regression analysis; Seismic survey; Marine biology; water; anthropogenic effect; endangered species; environmental impact assessment; feeding behavior; hydrocarbon exploration; multiple regression; seismic survey; whale; aircraft noise; animal behavior; animal food; article; benthos; controlled study; data analysis; endangered species; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; mathematical analysis; multiple regression; noise pollution; nonhuman; plume; population abundance; Russian Federation; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Data Collection; Extraction and Processing Industry; Feeding Behavior; Geologic Sediments; Noise; Petroleum; Russia; Whales; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,"water, 7732-18-5; Petroleum",,,,"Acknowledgements Many people helped in the collection and analysis of the data and preparation of this report, and many of our Russian colleagues participated in the organization of this project.

The area of seismic exploration was immediately adjacent to the Piltun feeding grounds of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). This study investigates relative abundance, behavior, and movement patterns of gray whales in relation to occurrence and proximity to the seismic survey by employing scan sampling, focal follow, and theodolite tracking methodologies. These data were analyzed in relation to temporal, environmental, and seismic related variables to evaluate potential disturbance reactions of gray whales to the seismic survey. The relative numbers of whales and pods recorded from five shore-based stations were not significantly different during periods when seismic surveys were occurring compared to periods when no seismic surveys were occurring and to the post-seismic period. Univariate analyses indicated no significant statistical correlation between seismic survey variables and any of the eleven movement and behavior variables. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after accounting for temporal and environmental variables, 6 of 11 movement and behavior variables (linearity, acceleration, mean direction, blows per surfacing, and surface-dive blow rate) were not significantly associated with seismic survey variables, and 5 of 11 variables (leg speed, reorientation rate, distance-from-shore, blow interval, and dive time) were significantly associated with seismic survey variables. In summary, after accounting for environmental variables, no correlation was found between seismic survey variables and the linearity of whale movements, changes in whale swimming speed between theodolite fixes, mean direction of whale movement, mean number of whale exhalations per minute at the surface, mean time at the surface, and mean number of exhalations per minute during a whales surface-to-dive cycle. In contrast, at higher received sound energy exposure levels, whales traveled faster, changed directions of movement less, were recorded further from shore, and stayed under water longer between respirations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Abundance; Behavior; Eschrichtius robustus; Geophysical seismic survey; Movement; Russia; Sakhalin Island; Western gray whale","Correlation methods; Marine biology; Regression analysis; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Surveys; Multiple regression analysis; Seismic exploration; Seismic survey; Environmental impact assessments; abundance; behavioral ecology; correlation; endangered species; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; feeding ground; multiple regression; seismic survey; species occurrence; whale; animal behavior; article; body movement; breathing mechanics; controlled study; correlation analysis; diving; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; exhalation; multiple regression; noise pollution; nonhuman; population abundance; population movement pattern; Russian Federation; summer; time; univariate analysis; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Data Collection; Locomotion; Noise; Population Density; Russia; Whales; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,"Acknowledgements We are grateful to Boris Antonov, Dorothy Baker, Nichollette Brown, Bob Brownell, Mike Jenkerson, Steve Johnson, Roman Korottihenko, Caroline Martin, Rodger Melton, Victor Protivich, Alexander Rutenko, Olga Sychenko, Karina Tarasyan, David Weller, and Sergei Yazvenko for providing logistical support in the field.

DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG), on behalf of the Sakhalin-1 consortium, conducted a 3-D seismic survey of the Odoptu license area during 17 August'9 September 2001. A portion of the primary known feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located adjacent to the seismic block. The data presented here were collected as part of daily monitoring to determine if there was any measurable effect of the seismic survey on the distribution and abundance of western gray whales. Mitigation and monitoring program included aerial surveys conducted between 19 July and 19 November using the methodology outlined by the Southern California High Energy Seismic Survey team (HESS). These surveys provided documentation of the distribution, abundance and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales in relation to seismic survey sounds. From an operations perspective, the aerial surveys provided near real-time data on the location of whales in and outside the feeding area, and documented whether whales were displaced out of an area normally used as feeding habitat. The objectives of this study were to assess (a) temporal changes in the distribution and abundance of gray whales in relation to seismic survey, and (b) the influence of seismic survey, environmental factors, and other variables on the distribution and abundance of gray whales within their preferred feeding area adjacent to Piltun Bay. Multiple regression analysis revealed a limited redistribution of gray whales southward within the Piltun feeding area when the seismic survey was fully operational. A total of five environmental and other variables unrelated to seismic survey (date and proxies of depth, sea state and visibility) and one seismic survey-related variable (seg3d, i.e., received sound energy accumulated over 3 days) had statistically significant effects on the distribution and abundance of gray whales. The distribution of two to four gray whales observed on the surface (i.e., about five to ten whales in total) has likely been affected by the seismic survey. However, the total number of gray whales observed within the Piltun feeding area remained stable during the seismic survey. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Abundance; Airgun; Continental shelf; Distribution; Environment; Environmental impact; Mitigation; Multiple regression; Odoptu; Oil; Sakhalin; Seismic survey; Western gray whales","Calibration; Marine biology; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Seismology; Statistics; Surveys; Multiple regression analysis; Seismic survey; Environmental impact assessments; abundance; aerial survey; anthropogenic effect; endangered species; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; feeding ground; hydrocarbon exploration; mitigation; multiple regression; population distribution; real time; seismic survey; whale; aircraft noise; animal behavior; animal food; article; controlled study; endangered species; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; mathematical computing; noise pollution; nonhuman; population abundance; regression analysis; Russian Federation; sound transmission; species distribution; species habitat; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Data Collection; Ecosystem; Extraction and Processing Industry; Feeding Behavior; Noise; Petroleum; Population Density; Regression Analysis; Russia; Whales; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,"Petroleum",,,,"Field support was provided by Exxon Neftegas Limited (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk).

Results of surveys in all years indicated gray whales occurred in predominantly two areas, (1) adjacent to Piltun Bay, and (2) offshore from Chayvo Bay, hereafter referred to as the Piltun and offshore feeding areas. In the Piltun feeding area, the majority of whales were observed in waters shallower than 20 m and were distributed from several hundred meters to ∼ 5 km from the shoreline. In the offshore feeding area during all years, the distribution of gray whales extended from southwest to northeast in waters 30-65 m in depth. During all years, the distribution and abundance of whales changed in both the Piltun and offshore feeding areas, and both north-south and inshore-offshore movements were documented within and between feeding seasons. The discovery of a significant number of whales feeding in the offshore area each year was a substantial finding of this study and raises questions regarding western gray whale abundance and population levels, feeding behavior and ecology, and individual site-fidelity. Fluctuations in the number of whales observed within the Piltun and offshore feeding areas and few sightings outside of these two areas indicate that gray whales move between the Piltun and offshore feeding areas during their summer-fall feeding season. Seasonal shifts in the distribution and abundance of gray whales between and within both the Piltun and offshore feeding areas are thought, in part, to be a response to seasonal changes in the distribution and abundance of prey. However, the mechanism driving the movements of whales along the northeast coast of Sakhalin Island is likely very complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Abundance; Aerial surveys; Distribution; Eschrichtius robustus; Sakhalin; Vessel surveys; Western gray whales","Climate change; Ecology; Statistics; Surveys; Aerial survey; Seasonal change; Marine biology; water; abundance; aerial survey; endangered species; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; feeding ground; population distribution; whale; aircraft noise; animal behavior; animal food; article; controlled study; ecology; endangered species; global positioning system; helicopter; noise pollution; nonhuman; population abundance; population size; Russian Federation; seasonal variation; species distribution; whale; Aircraft; Animals; Data Collection; Ecosystem; Population Density; Russia; Seasons; Ships; Whales; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Acknowledgements Many people contributed to the overall success of the western gray whale vessel and aerial monitoring programs and the subsequent analyses and reporting.

Box 4876, Houston, TX 77210-4876, United States","The introduction of anthropogenic sounds into the marine environment can impact some marine mammals. Impacts can be greatly reduced if appropriate mitigation measures and monitoring are implemented. This paper concerns such measures undertaken by Exxon Neftegas Limited, as operator of the Sakhalin-1 Consortium, during the Odoptu 3-D seismic survey conducted during 17 August-9 September 2001. The key environmental issue was protection of the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), which feeds in summer and fall primarily in the Piltun feeding area off northeast Sakhalin Island. Existing mitigation and monitoring practices for seismic surveys in other jurisdictions were evaluated to identify best practices for reducing impacts on feeding activity by western gray whales. Two buffer zones were established to protect whales from physical injury or undue disturbance during feeding. A 1 km buffer protected all whales from exposure to levels of sound energy potentially capable of producing physical injury. A 4-5 km buffer was established to avoid displacing western gray whales from feeding areas. Trained Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) on the seismic ship Nordic Explorer had the authority to shut down the air guns if whales were sighted within these buffers. Additional mitigation measures were also incorporated: Temporal mitigation was provided by rescheduling the program from June-August to August-September to avoid interference with spring arrival of migrating gray whales. The survey area was reduced by 19% to avoid certain waters &lt;20 m deep where feeding whales concentrated and where seismic acquisition was a lower priority. The number of air guns and total volume of the air guns were reduced by about half (from 28 to 14 air guns and from 3,390 in3 to 1,640 in3) relative to initial plans. ""Ramp-up"" (=""soft-start"") procedures were implemented. Monitoring activities were conducted as needed to implement some mitigation measures, and to assess residual impacts. Aerial and vessel-based surveys determined the distribution of whales before, during and after the seismic survey. Daily aerial reconnaissance helped verify whale-free areas and select the sequence of seismic lines to be surveyed. A scout vessel with MMOs aboard was positioned 4 km shoreward of the active seismic vessel to provide better visual coverage of the 4-5 km buffer and to help define the inshore edge of the 4-5 km buffer. A second scout vessel remained near the seismic vessel. Shore-based observers determined whale numbers, distribution, and behavior during and after the seismic survey. Acoustic monitoring documented received sound levels near and in the main whale feeding area. Statistical analyses of aerial survey data indicated that about 5-10 gray whales moved away from waters near (inshore of) the seismic survey during seismic operations. They shifted into the core gray whale feeding area farther south, and the proportion of gray whales observed feeding did not change over the study period. Five shutdowns of the air guns were invoked for gray whales seen within or near the buffer. A previously unknown gray whale feeding area (the Offshore feeding area) was discovered south and offshore from the nearshore Piltun feeding area. The Offshore area has subsequently been shown to be used by feeding gray whales during several years when no anthropogenic activity occurred near the Piltun feeding area. Shore-based counts indicated that whales continued to feed inshore of the Odoptu block throughout the seismic survey, with no significant correlation between gray whale abundance and seismic activity. Average values of most behavioral parameters were similar to those without seismic surveys. Univariate analysis showed no correlation between seismic sound levels and any behavioral parameter. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after allowance for environmental covariates, 5 of 11 behavioral parameters were statistically correlated with estimated seismic survey-related variables; 6 of 11 behavioral parameters were not statistically correlated with seismic survey-related variables. Behavioral parameters that were correlated with seismic variables were transient and within the range of variation attributable to environmental effects. Acoustic monitoring determined that the 4-5 km buffer zone, in conjunction with reduction of the air gun array to 14 guns and 1,640 in3, was effective in limiting sound exposure. Within the Piltun feeding area, these mitigation measures were designed to insure that western gray whales were not exposed to received levels exceeding the 163 dB re 1 μPa (rms) threshold. This was among the most complexand intensive mitigation programs ever conducted for any marine mammal. It provided valuable new information about underwater sounds and gray whale responses during a nearshore seismic program that will be useful in planning future work. Overall, the efforts in 2001 were successful in reducing impacts to levels tolerable by western gray whales. Research in 2002-2005 suggested no biologically significant or population-level impacts of the 2001 seismic survey. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Eschrichtius robustus; Mitigation; Monitoring; Okhotsk Sea; Russia; Sakhalin Island; Seismic survey; Western gray whale","Environmental regulations; Mammals; Regression analysis; Russia; Seismic prospecting; Acoustic monitoring; Aerial reconnaissance; Buffer zones; Seismic survey; Environmental protection; air gun; endangered species; environmental issue; monitoring; seismic survey; species conservation; whale; acoustic stress; animal behavior; animal food; article; autumn; controlled study; correlation analysis; endangered species; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; mammal; marine environment; multiple regression; noise pollution; nonhuman; Russian Federation; seasonal variation; spring; statistical analysis; summer; univariate analysis; weapon; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Data Collection; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Extraction and Processing Industry; Feeding Behavior; Noise; Petroleum; Russia; Whales; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,"Petroleum",,,,"Various other Russian and North American scientists provided important advice and guidance during the various workshops, planning sessions, project reviews, and report reviews.

High variance in isotopic composition of baleen plates was detected among individuals and, unlike other migratory species of baleen whales examined isotopically, δ13C and δ15N values of most whales showed no regular oscillations. Only one baleen plate reflected the assumed principal Arctic prey (ampeliscid amphipods) during growth on the summer grounds. The rate of baleen growth inferred for one of the juveniles in the last 5 months of life (4.7 mm/week) was similar to the rate calculated previously for a rehabilitating gray whale calf. Autumn corresponded to the timing of the formation of lowest δ15N values measured along plates. We estimate that the baleen length in all adult gray whales recorded around a year of information (1.3 ± 0.3; Mean ± SD). This short period of dietary integration precludes long time series analyses in this species and reflects the extensive wear on baleen plates due to benthic foraging. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Feeding ecology; Gray whale; Stable carbon and Nitrogen isotope","Carbon; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Nutrition; Time series analysis; Dietary integration; Feeding ecology; Gray whale; Regular oscillations; Ecology; carbon isotope; feeding ecology; growth; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; migratory species; nitrogen isotope; stable isotope; whale; Ampeliscidae; Amphipoda; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysticeti",,,,,"Centro de Investigaciones BiolÃ³gicas del Noroeste, CIBNOR

In collaboration with a broad-scale oceanographic study, three autonomous acoustic recorders were moored northeast of Barrow in October 2003 to provide capability for year-round detection of calls. Two recorders were recovered in September 2004, one from the continental slope (water depth = 316 m) and one from near the base of the slope (water depth = 1258 m). The shallow instrument recorded for roughly 3 months (87 days), and the deeper instrument for roughly 7.3 months (222 days). Gray whale calls were recorded on both instruments throughout their periods of operation. The calling rate at the shallower instrument was higher than at the deeper recorder, but surprisingly, the deeper instrument detected calls throughout the 2003-04 winter, though the calling rate diminished as winter progressed. Low-frequency N1/S1 pulses, the most common of the calls produced by gray whales, were recorded from deployment through December 2003 on the shallower of the two instruments and from deployment through May 2004 on the deeper instrument. Because this is the first-ever winter-long acoustic study, we cannot be certain that gray whales have not overwintered in the Beaufort Sea in the past. However, a combination of increasing population size and habitat alteration associated with sea ice reduction and warming in the Alaskan Arctic may be responsible for the extra-seasonal gray whale occurrence near Barrow. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Acoustics; Barrow; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale","calling behavior; population size; whale; winter; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; North America; United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"NOAA aids rescue of gray, beluga whales (1989) Marine Fisheries Review, 51 (1), p. 51. , ANONYMOUS; BRAHAM, H.W., Distribution and migration (1984) The gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, pp. 249-266. , Jones, M.L, Swartz, S.L, and Leatherwood, S, eds, San Diego, California: Academic Press; CHARIF, R.A., CLARK, C.W., and FRISTRUP, K.M. 2004.

Resident killer whales were found 12 times more frequently than transient killer whales, and offshore killer whales were encountered only once. A minimum of 901 photographically identified resident whales used the region during our study. A total of 165 mammal-eating transient killer whales were identified, and the majority (70%) were encountered during spring (May and June). The diet of transient killer whales in spring was primarily gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), and in summer primarily northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) did not appear to be a preferred prey or major prey item during spring and summer.

This event had profound effects on both resident gray-whales (Eschrichtius robustus) and their food source, mysids, off Depoe Bay, Oregon. Near bottom swarms of gray whales' major prey item, Holmesimysis sculpta, were sparse until August, a marked contrast to normal years when mysid swarms are abundant all summer. A large percentage of mysid females had empty brood pouches in 2005 while in 2003 and 2004 all observed females had full brood pouches. Gray whales spent little time foraging and spent fewer days in residence than in earlier years. The 2005 resident whales also showed signs of poor body condition, reflecting a nutritional deficit.

Similar morphologies have been observed in two specimens which are respectively from the Early Pliocene of Piedmont and the Late Miocene of Apulia, Italy. The peculiar organization of the coronoid region consists of the presence of a satellite process parallel or slightly anterior to the coronoid process with a groove interposed between them. The morphology of the dentary is used here to emend the diagnosis of the family Eschrichtiidae and for including the above Italian specimens in this family. Such an emendation is due to the unique mandibular organization shared by Eschrichtius robustes and the Italian specimens mentioned above. The new diagnosis allows the establishment of the new genus Archaeschrichtius from the Late Miocene of Apulia, which represents the oldest eschrichtiid mysticete to be formally described up to now. Italian specimens extends back to the Late Miocene the fossil record of Eschrichtiidae and document aspects of feeding evolution within Eschrichtiidae for the first time.","Dentary; Eschrichtiidae; Italy; Miocene; Mysticeti","dentition; feeding ecology; fossil record; Miocene; morphology; new genus; paleontology; Pliocene; taxonomy; whale; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Puglia; Southern Europe; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius; Eschrichtius robustus; Mysticeti; Zanclea",,,,,,,,,"Baker, A.N., Pygmy right whale - Caperea marginata (1985) Handbook of Marine Mammals, 3, pp. 345-355. , S.

Morphometric data from whaling records and recent stranding events were compiled, and morphometric parameters describing the body length, and fluke and flipper dimensions for an ""average"" blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, and right whale Eubalaena glacialis were determined. Body mass, body volume, body surface area, and fluke and flipper surface areas were estimated. The resultant morphological configurations lent themselves to the following classifications based on hydrodynamic principles: fast cruiser, slow cruiser, fast maneuverer, and slow maneuverer. Blue whales have highly stream-lined bodies with small, high aspect ratio flippers and flukes for fast efficient cruising in the open ocean. On the other hand, the rotund right whale has large, high aspect ratio flukes for efficient slow speed cruising that is optimal for their continuous filter feeding technique. Humpbacks have large, high aspect ratio flippers and a large, low aspect ratio tail for quick acceleration and high-speed maneuvering which would help them catch their elusive prey, while gray whales have large, low aspect ratio flippers and flukes for enhanced low-speed maneuvering in complex coastal water habitats. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cetacean; Feeding ecology; Functional morphology; Mysticete; Swim performance","adaptation; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; feeding behavior; histology; locomotion; physiology; predation; swimming; whale; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Locomotion; Models, Anatomic; Predatory Behavior; Swimming; Whales; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; Andrews, R.C., Notes upon the external and internal anatomy of Balaena glacialis Bonn (1908) Bull Am Mus Nat Hist, 24, pp. 171-182; Andrews, R.C., Monograph of the pacific cetacean California gray whale (1914) Mem Am Mus Nat Hist, 1, pp. 229-287; Benke, H., Investigations on the osteology and functional morphology of the flipper of whales and dolphins (Cetacea) (1993) Investig Cetacea, 24, pp. 9-252; Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (SPEC.

Analysis of stomach contents revealed that teleosts were the dominant prey in August and cephalopods were the dominant prey in May (n = 198). Marine mammals were found in 15% of stomachs regardless of season, but no Steller sea lion tissues were detected. Molecular genetic analysis identified grey whale Eschrichtius robustus and harbour seal Phoca vitulina remains in some Pacific sleeper shark stomachs. Most mammals were cetacean and at least 70% of the cetaceans were probably scavenged. Although Pacific sleeper shark and Steller sea lion ranges overlapped, so predation could potentially occur, the diet study suggested that predation on Steller sea lions is unlikely, at least when pups first enter the water or during weaning. Harbour seals were infrequent prey and may have been consumed alive. Pacific sleeper sharks consume fast-swimming prey like Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus sp., most likely live animals rather than scavenged animals. Pacific sleeper sharks appeared to be opportunistic consumers of the available prey and carrion, feeding both on the bottom and in the water column, and their diet shifted to teleosts and cetacean carrion as the fish grew larger. © 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Diet; Predation; Sea lion; Sleeper shark","diet; genetic analysis; marine mammal; molecular analysis; pinniped; prey capture; shark; stomach content; teleost; weaning; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); Animalia; Cephalopoda; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Eschrichtius robustus; Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus sp.; Phoca; Phoca vitulina; Somniosus pacificus; Teleostei",,,,,,,,,"Bigelow, H.B., Schroeder, W.C., (1948) Fishes of the Western North Atlantic, (1 PART). , New Haven, CT: Sears Foundation for Marine Research, Yale University; Bright, H.B., The occurrence and food of the sleeper shark, Somniosus pacificus, in a central Alaska bay (1959) Copeia, 1959, pp. 76-77; Compagno, L.J.V., Sharks of the world.

Subjected to intensive commercial whaling during the 19th and 20th centuries, the western population presently numbers approximately 100 individuals and is regarded as one of the most endangered baleen whale populations in the world. Since 1997, ongoing studies of western gray whales have resulted in a photographic dataset that can be used for mark-recapture survival estimation. Pollock's robust design was applied to 129 individual whale encounter histories spanning 25 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2003. Using Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) model selection, models incorporating individual heterogeneity in residency patterns and higher temporary emigration probabilities for younger whales provided better fits to the data. Non-calf and calf (1st year post-weaning) survival were estimated as 0.951 (SE = 0.0135, 95 % CI = 0.917 to 0.972) and 0.701 (SE = 0.0944, 95 % CI = 0.492 to 0.850), respectively, averaging across the best models (n = 13) in order to account for model uncertainty. The non-calf survival point estimate is similar to mark-recapture estimates for Gulf of Maine humpback whales, but lower than an indirect estimate for the eastern gray whale population. Although no statistically robust direct estimates of baleen whale calf survival exist for comparison to the current study, the calf survival estimate is markedly lower than a value suggested for Gulf of Maine humpback whales. Estimation of survival is necessary for assessing the status of western gray whales, which can contribute to increased protection, conservation, and management planning for this critically endangered population. © Inter-Research 2006.","Individual heterogeneity; Mark-recapture; Photo-identification; Robust design; Sakhalin Island; Survival estimation; Temporary emigration; Western gray whale","emigration; endangered species; estimation method; heterogeneity; mark-recapture method; population decline; survival; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera; Mysticeti; Pollachius virens",,,,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , Petrov BN, Csaki F (eds) Akademiai Kiado, Budapest; Baldridge, A., Killer whales attack and eat a gray whale (1972) J Mammal, 53, pp. 898-900; Baker, C.S., Dalebout, M.L., Lento, G.M., Gray whale products sold in commercial markets along the Pacific coast of Japan (2002) Mar Mamm Sci, 18, pp. 295-300; Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth-interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback whales (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 535-546; Berzin, A.A., (1990) Gray Whales of the Okhotsk-Korean Population in the Sea of Okhotsk, , www.iwoffice.org, Paper SC/A90/G28 presented to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee; Berzin, A.A., Vladimirov, V.L., Doroshenko, N.V., Results of aerial surveys to study the distribution and abundance of cetaceans in the coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk in 1986-1987 (1988) Nauchno-issledovatel'skie Ra'boty Po Morskim Mlekopitayushchim Severnoi Chasti Tikhogo Okeana V 1986-1987, pp. 18-25. , Chernysheva NS (ed) All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO), Moscow, Russia, in Russian; Berzin, A.A., Vladimirov, V.L., Doroshenko, N.V., Aerial surveys to determine the distribution and number of polar gray whales and beluga whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1985-1989 (1990) Izvestiya Tikhookeanskogo Nauchno-issledovatel'skogo Instituta Rybnogo Khozyaistva I Okeanografii (TINRO), 112, pp. 51-60. , in Russian; Berzin, A.A., Vladimirov, V.L., Doroshenko, N.V., Results of aerial surveys to study the distribution and abundance of whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1988-1990 (1991) Nauchno-issledovatel'skie Ra'boty Po Morskim Mlekopitayushchim Severnoi Chasti Tikhogo Okeana V 1989-1990, pp. 6-17. , Popov LA (ed) All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO), Moscow, Russia, in Russian; Best, P.B., Brandão, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, (2 SPEC.

Sequential megafaunal collapse in the North Pacific Ocean: an ongoing legacy of industrial whaling? Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 100 (21), 12,223-12,228] hypothesized that great whales were an important prey resource for killer whales, and that the removal of fin and sperm whales by commercial whaling in the region of the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) in the late 1960s and 1970s led to cascading trophic interactions that caused the sequential decline of populations of harbor seal, northern fur seal, Steller sea lion and northern sea otter. This hypothesis, referred to as the Sequential Megafaunal Collapse (SMC), has stirred considerable interest because of its implication for ecosystem-based management. The SMC has the following assumptions: (1) fin whales and sperm whales were important as prey species in the Bering Sea; (2) the biomass of all large whale species (i.e., North Pacific right, fin, humpback, gray, sperm, minke and bowhead whales) was in decline in the Bering Sea in the 1960s and early 1970s; and (3) pinniped declines in the 1970s and 1980s were sequential. We concluded that the available data are not consistent with the first two assumptions of the SMC. Statistical tests of the timing of the declines do not support the assumption that pinniped declines were sequential. We propose two alternative hypotheses for the declines that are more consistent with the available data. While it is plausible, from energetic arguments, for predation by killer whales to have been an important factor in the declines of one or more of the three populations of pinnipeds and the sea otter population in the BSAI region over the last 30 years, we hypothesize that the declines in pinniped populations in the BSAI can best be understood by invoking a multiple factor hypothesis that includes both bottom-up forcing (as indicated by evidence of nutritional stress in the western Steller sea lion population) and top-down forcing (e.g., predation by killer whales, mortality incidental to commercial fishing, directed harvests). Our second hypothesis is a modification of the top-down forcing mechanism (i.e., killer whale predation on one or more of the pinniped populations and the sea otter population is mediated via the recovery of the eastern North Pacific population of the gray whale). We remain skeptical about the proposed link between commercial whaling on fin and sperm whales, which ended in the mid-1960s, and the observed decline of populations of northern fur seal, harbor seal, and Steller sea lion some 15 years later. © 2006.","Harbor seal; Killer whale; Northern fur seal; Population declines; Predator-prey; Steller sea lion","Biodiversity; Oceanography; Seals; Harbor seal; Killer whale; National Academy of Sciences; Northern fur seal; Population declines; Predator-prey; Sequential Megafaunal Collapse (SMC); Steller sea lion; Ecosystems; biomass; harbor; nutritional status; pinniped; trophic interaction; whale; whaling; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Bering Sea; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Carnivora; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Enhydra lutris; Enhydra lutris kenyoni; Eschrichtius robustus; Eumetopias jubatus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phoca vitulina; Physeteridae; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,,,"Benson, A.J., Trites, A.W., Ecological effects of regime shifts in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific Ocean (2003) Fish and Fisheries, 3, pp. 95-113; Braham, H.W., Everitt, R.D., Rugh, D.J., Northern sea lion population decline in the eastern Aleutian Islands (1980) Journal of Wildlife Management, 44, pp. 25-33; Calkins, D.G., Becker, E.F., Pitcher, K.W., Reduced body size of female Steller sea lions from a declining population in the Gulf of Alaska (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14 (2), pp. 232-244; Eberhardt, L.L., Breiwick, J., Impact of recent population data on historical population levels of bowhead whales inferred from simulation studies (1992) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 42, pp. 485-489; Eberhardt, L.L., DeMaster, D.P., Sease, J., Projecting the trend of Steller sea lion populations in western Alaska (2005) Marine Mammal Science, 21 (4), pp. 728-738; Estes, J.A., Tinker, M.T., Williams, T.M., Doak, D.F., Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems (1998) Science, 282, pp. 473-476; Fritz, L.W., Ferrero, R.C., Berg, R.J., The threatened status of Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, under the Endangered Species Act: effects on Alaska groundfish management (1995) Marine Fisheries Review, 57 (2), pp. 14-27; Fritz, L.W., Hinckley, S., A critical review of the regime shift- junk food - nutritional stress hypothesis for the decline of the western stock of Steller sea lion (2005) Marine Mammal Science, 21, pp. 476-518; Frost, K.J., Lowry, L.F., Ver Hoef, J.M., Monitoring the trend of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill (1999) Marine Mammal Science, 15, pp. 494-506; Hobbs, R.C., Rugh, D.J., Waite, J.M., Breiwick, J.M., DeMaster, D.P., Abundance of eastern North Pacific gray whales on the 1995/96 southbound migration (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6 (2), pp. 115-120; Holmes, E.E., York, A.E., Using age structure to detect impacts on threatened populations: a case study with Steller sea lions (2003) Conservation Biology, 17 (6), pp. 1794-1806; Hoover-Miller, A.A., (1994) Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) biology and management in Alaska, , Marine Mammal Commission, Washington, D.C 45 pp; International Whaling Commission, Report of the Scientific Committee (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6, pp. 211-217; Kenyon, K.W., Rice, D.W., Abundance and distribution of the Steller sea lion (1961) Journal of Mammalogy, 42, pp. 223-234; Loughlin, T., Rugh, D., Fiscus, C., Northern sea lion distribution and abundance: 1956-1980 (1984) Journal of Wildlife Management, 48, pp. 729-740; Loughlin, T.R., Perlov, A.S., Vladimirov, V.A., Range wide survey and estimate of total number of Steller sea lions in 1989 (1992) Marine Mammal Science, 8, pp. 220-239; Loughlin, T.R., York, A.E., An accounting of the sources of Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, mortality (2000) Marine Fisheries Review, 62 (4), pp. 40-45; Matkin, C.O., Barrett-Lennard, L., Ellis, G., Killer whales and predation on Steller sea lions (2002) Steller sea lion decline: Is it food II, , DeMaster D., and Atkinson S.

In response to conservation and management concerns about gray whale Eschrichtius robustus population and stock structure, we provide an overview of the life history and ecology of gray whales as a context for discussion of population and stock structure within the species. Historically eastern and western North Pacific gray whales were managed separately because: (i) their ranges do not overlap; (ii) genetic analyses indicate that the two populations are significantly different; and (iii) eastern gray whales have increased in abundance over the past century while western gray whales have not. 2. Here, we review gray whale migration timing and segregation, feeding and prey species, and reproduction and reproductive behaviour. For the eastern and western gray whale, we review their distribution, history of exploitation, abundance and current status, although most of what is known is founded on the better studied eastern gray whale and only implied for the lesser known western gray whale. Methods to investigate population and stock identity are reviewed including genetics, morphology, chemical signatures, carbon isotopes, parasites, photographic identification and trends in abundance. 3. While the evidence indicates that there is at least some degree of mixing within each of the gray whale populations, no stocks or sub-stocks can be defined. Population structure is not evident in nuclear data, and because selection occurs primarily on the nuclear genome, it is unlikely that there is structuring within each population that could result in evolutionary differences. For western gray whales, there are insufficient data to assess the plausibility of stock structure within the population, owing to its extremely depleted state. Research on eastern gray whales has focused mostly on documenting changes in abundance, feeding biology and behaviour, and suggests separate breeding groups to be unlikely. Both males and females are promiscuous breeders lending little opportunity for the nuclear genome to be anything other than well mixed as is suggested by the high haplotypic diversity of the eastern population. 4. The available data strongly indicate that western gray whales represent a population geographically isolated from eastern gray whales and therefore that the western and eastern populations should be treated as separate management units. © 2006 Mammal Society.","Cetaceans; Marine mammals; North Pacific Ocean; Population structure; Stock identity; Wildlife management","feeding behavior; migration; population structure; reproduction; reproductive behavior; species conservation; stock assessment; whale; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea.

To date, autonomous recorders have been successfully deployed in the Gulf of Alaska (1999-2001), the southeastern Bering Sea (2000-present), and the western Beaufort Sea (2003-2004). Seasonal occurrences of six endangered species (blue, fin, humpback, North Pacific right, bowhead, and sperm whales) have been documented on the basis of call receptions in these remote ocean regions. In addition, eastern North Pacific gray whale calls were detected in the western Beaufort Sea from October 2003 through May 2004. Here we provide an overview of this suite of research projects and suggest the next steps for applying acoustic data from long-term recorders to the assessment of large whale populations. © 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Acoustics; Alaska; Recorders; Remote sensing; Whales","Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeteridae",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

A total of 96 feeding dives were recorded from six different whales. More than half (53.1%) of the whales' bottom time was spent rolled at an angle greater than 45°. Whales rolled an average of 2.9 times per feeding dive, and rolling behavior was often accompanied by a negative pitch angle. Out of 282 recorded rolls, 274 (97.2%) were to the right. Likewise, 98.5% of the total time spent rolled at an angle greater than 45° was spent rolled to the right. The gray whales in this study showed a significant right-side bias on both an individual (P ≤ 0.009) and group level (P < 0.001). Based on the findings of this study and previous reports of uneven baleen wear (Kasuya and Rice 1970), it is proposed that gray whales exhibit a population-wide right-side rolling bias similar in character to the 90/10 split of right handedness in humans. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Diving; DTAG; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding behavior; Gray whale; Lateralized behavior; Tagging","diving behavior; feeding behavior; handedness; whale; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Caldwell, M.C., Caldwell, D.K., Siebenaler, J.B., Observations on captive and wild Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (1965) Los Angeles County Museum Contributions in Science, 91, pp. 3-10; Clapham, P.J., Leimkuhler, E., Gray, B.K., Mattila, D.A., Do humpback whales exhibit lateralized behaviour?

We document a new symbiosis between marine polychaetes of the genus Osedax and members of the bacterial group Oceanospirillales, known for heterotrophic degradation of complex organic compounds. These organisms were discovered living on the carcass of a grey whale at 2891 m depth in Monterey Canyon, off the coast of California. The mouthless and gutless worms are unique in their morphological specializations used to obtain nutrition from decomposing mammalian bones. Adult worms possess elaborate posterior root-like extensions that invade whale bone and contain bacteriocytes that house intracellular symbionts. Stable isotopes and fatty acid analyses suggest that these unusual endosymbionts are likely responsible for the nutrition of this locally abundant and reproductively prolific deep-sea worm. © 2005 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bacterial RNA; DNA; fatty acid; RNA 16S; animal; article; bioremediation; bone; chemistry; electron microscopy; evolution; genetics; growth, development and aging; microbiology; Oceanospirillaceae; Pacific Ocean; phylogeny; Polychaeta; symbiosis; ultrastructure; whale; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bone and Bones; DNA; Evolution; Fatty Acids; Microscopy, Electron; Oceanospirillaceae; Pacific Ocean; Phylogeny; Polychaeta; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Symbiosis; Whales; Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtius robustus; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Oceanospirillales; Polychaeta",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, 9007-49-2; Fatty Acids; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,,,,,"Amann, R.I., Binder, B.J., Olson, R.J., Chisholm, S.W., Devereux, R., Stahl, D.A., Combination of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes with flow cytometry for analyzing mixed microbial populations (1990) Appl Environ Microbiol, 56, pp. 1919-1925; Behrens, S., Fuchs, B.M., Mueller, F., Amann, R., Is the in situ accessibility of the 16S rRNA of Escherichia coli for Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes predicted by a three-dimensional structure model of the 30S ribosomal subunit?

Underwater observations of bottom feeding were made (n=4). Skin biopsies of the gray whale had a carbon isotope value of -16.5 ± 0.1‰ (range from -16.4 to -16.7, n=7). Prey in Bahía Magdalena had a carbon isotope value of -18.4‰. Dietary enrichment from prey in Bahía Magdalena would correspond to 2 ± 0.1‰, whereas previously published results for prey in Alaska would result in an enrichment of 3‰, which suggests that whales were more likely feeding on prey from Bahía Magdalena. Carbon isotopic oscillation along the baleen plate of a stranded 1-year-old whale showed a variation in diet during the year, which suggests continual feeding during this time and corresponding to dietary sample measurements from Bahía Magdalena in winter and Alaska in summer. © Springer 2005.","Feeding ecology; Gray whales; Stable carbon isotope","Carbon; Ecology; Fisheries; Isotopes; Oscillations; Oxygen; Biopsies; Carbon isotopes; Gray whale; Underwater observation; Marine biology; feeding ecology; Baja California Sur; Magdalena Bay; Mexico [North America]; North America; Western Hemisphere; World; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"Centro de Investigaciones BiolÃ³gicas del Noroeste, CIBNOR

White patches (blotches) appearing on a gray whale's left and right flukes (the flattened broad paddle-like tail) constitute unique identifying features and have been used here for individual identification. The fluke area is extracted from a fluke image via the live-wire edge detection algorithm, followed by optimal thresholding of the fluke area to obtain the blotches. Affine point-set and line invariants of the blotch points are extracted based on three reference points, namely the left and right tips and the middle notch-like point on the fluke.

Fisher discriminants are used and the invariants are projected onto the subspace spanned by the Fisher basis vectors. The technique has been applied to photo-identification of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) using their field images. White patches (blotches) appearing on a gray whale's left and right flukes constitute unique identifying features and have been used here for individual identification. The fluke area is extracted from a fluke image via the live-wire edge detection algorithm, followed by optimal thresholding of the fluke area to obtain the blotches. Zernike Moment Invariants are then calculated for the blotches and projected onto the subspace spanned by Fisher basis vectors. These invariants are used as the feature vector representing a database image. During matching, the database images are ranked depending on the degree of similarity between a query and database feature vectors. The results show that the use of this algorithm leads to a significant reduction in the amount of manual search that is normally done by marine biologists.","Bio-medical image processing; Fisher discriminant; Photo-identification of gray-whales; Zernike Moment Invariants","Bio-medical image processing; Fisher discriminant; Fisher discriminant models; Photo-identification of grey-whales; Zernike moment invariants; Biomedical engineering; Database systems; Image analysis; Invariance; Marine biology; Pattern recognition; Photointerpretation; Vectors; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,,"Reiss, T.H., Recognizing planar objects using invariant image features (1993) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 676. , Springer, Berlin; Flusser, J., Suk, T., Pattern recognition by affine moment invariants (1993) Pattern Recognition, 26 (1), pp. 167-174; Kehtarnavaz, N., Peddigari, V., Chandan, C., Syed, W., Hillman, Q., Wursig, B., Photo-identification of humpback and gray whales using affine moment invariants (2003) Proc. 13 th Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, pp. 109-116. , Sweden; Meer, P., Weiss, I., Point/Line correspondence under 2D projective transformation (1992) Proc. 11 th Intl.

Three separate V. flokati populations were sampled using submersibles: two associated with implanted gray whale carcasses in the San Diego Trough (1240 m depth) and the Santa Cruz Basin (1670 m) off California, and one from sperm whale and balaeanopterid bones implanted on the slope of Oahu, Hawaii at 1000 m. Extraordinarily large numbers of live specimens were observed and videotaped in situ using submersibles in the San Diego Trough and the Santa Cruz Basin. The populations on the carcass implanted for 4 months in San Diego Trough, and on the bones implanted for 2 years off Oahu, were composed only of small sized individuals (including juveniles). V. flokati most closely resembles the poorly known V. zaikai Kiseleva, 1992, described from the Black Sea. Forty-six morphological characters were used in a phylogenetic analysis of selected nereidiform polychaetes. The resulting most-parsimonious trees indicate sister taxon status between V. flokati and V. zaikai, and that this clade is sister to the putatively ancient polychaete clade Chrysopetalidae. Whale falls, which are intense point sources of organic enrichment at the deep-sea floor, pass through three successional stages. V. flokati appears to colonize the middle, ""enrichment opportunist"" stage, inhabiting organic-rich bones and sediments ∼4-24 months after carcass arrival. V. flokati exhibits remarkable behavior, clinging posteriorly to whale bones or nearby sediments to form a writhing carpet at densities exceeding 8000 m -2. Its extraordinary abundance on whale falls, and apparent absence from other habitats, suggests it to be a whale-fall specialist. The precise feeding mechanism of the worm remains unknown, but we hypothesize that it may utilize dissolved organic carbon derived from the organic-rich setting of whale falls. The widespread occurrence of V. flokati on ephemeral, food-rich habitat islands in the Pacific suggests life-history strategies analogous to those for hydrothermal-vent and cold-seep species. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Institute, 7700 Sandholdt Road, Moss Landing, CA, United States","On February 6, 2002, we discovered an unusual assemblage of deep-sea animals associated with a well-preserved carcass of a gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) at 2891m depth in the axis of Monterey Canyon, California. The 9-10m long carcass was found approximately 31km off shore, where it settled to the bottom against the northern wall of the canyon's sedimented floor. This carcass delivered approximately 20,000kg of organic material to a typically food-limited seafloor. Particularly noteworthy were the low occurrence of large mobile scavengers, the large number of opportunistic deep-sea species, and an abundance of unusual polychaetes. Two of these polychaetes, a spionid and a siboglinid, are new to science. Since this discovery, we visited the whale fall on two subsequent occasions (March and October 2002) to document faunal community changes in one of the deepest large food falls known to date. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

DDTs were the most predominant contaminants, followed by PCBs, chlordanes, TCPMe, HCHs, TCPMOH, dieldrin, and heptachlor epoxide. Concentrations of PCBs and DDTs varied from a few μg/g to several hundreds of μg/g on a lipid weight basis. Concentrations of DDTs have declined by an order of magnitude over the last three decades in California sea lions; nevertheless, the measured concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in California sea lions are still some of the highest values reported for marine mammals in recent years. Concentrations of organochlorines were highly correlated with one another. Concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in the blubber of gray whale, humpback whale, northern elephant seal, and harbor seal, and in the adipose fat of sea otter, were lower than the levels found in California sea lions, and were in the range of a few to several μg/g on a lipid weight basis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Mhc-I polymorphism is considered critical for eliciting immune responses to a diversity of antigens, and thus, for the health and conservation of a species. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism it was concluded that whales generally have low Mhc-I polymorphism. This was attributed to the weak pathogenic pressure in aquatic habitats. Since gray whales habits might favor their encounter with diverse pathogens, resulting in selection pressures for Mhc variability, we searched for functional polymorphism of gray whale's Mhc-I exon 2 sequences that encode the α-1 protein domain of the antigen-binding region. We sequenced twelve Mhc-I exon 2 clones from each of seven gray whales. Most obtained sequences were similar to functional artiodactyl sequences, and their reconstructed phylogeny consistently showed three whale Mhc-I exon 2 sequence clusters (A, B, and C). Sequences within a given cluster and from distinct clusters, showed a greater number of non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions, that commonly shifted the physiochemical properties of the involved residue, suggesting the existence of a diverse repertoire of Mhc-I antigen recognition sites in gray whales, and that selection maintains gray whales Mhc-I allelic diversity.","Cetacea; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Major histocompatibility complex; Mysticetes","cetacean; Artiodactyla; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,,"Al-Murrani, S.W., Glass, E.J., Hopkins, J., BoLA class I charge heterogeneity reflects the expression of more than two loci (1994) Animal Genetics, 25, pp. 165-172; Avery, W.E., Hawkinson, C., Gray whale feeding in a Northern California estuary (1992) Northwest Scientist, 66, pp. 199-203; Bjorkman, P., Parham, P., Structure function and diversity of class 1 major histocompatibility complex molecules (1990) Annual Review of Biochemistry, 59, pp. 253-288; Bjorkman, P.J., Saper, M.A., Samraoui, B., Bennet, W.S., Strominger, J.L., Wiley, D.C., The foreign antigen binding site and T cell recognition regions of class 1 histocompatibility antigens (1987) Nature, 329, pp. 512-518; Domingo, M., Ferrer, L., Pumarola, M., Marco, A., Plana, J., Kennedy, S., Morbillivirus in dolphins (1990) Nature, 348, p. 21; Ellegren, H., Mikko, S.D., Wallin, K., Anderson, L., Limited polymorphism at Major Histocompatibility Complex MHC loci in the Swedish moose Alces alces (1996) Molecular Ecology, 5, pp. 3-9; Escayg, A.P., Hickford, G.H., Bullock, D.W., Association between alleles of the ovine major histocompatibility complex and resistance to footrot (1997) Research Veterinary Science, 63, pp. 283-287; Flores-Ramirez, S., Urban-Ramirez, J., Miller, R.D., Major histocompatibility complex class 1 loci from the gray whale (Eschrichtus robustus) (2000) The Journal of Heredity, 91, pp. 279-282; Garber, T.L., Hughes, A.L., Letvin, N.L., Templeton, J.W., Watkins, D.I., Sequence and evolution of cattle MHC class I cDNAs: Concerted evolution has not taken place in cattle (1993) Immunogenetis, 38, pp. 11-20; Garber, T.L., Hughes, A.L., Watkins, D.I., Templeton, J.W., Evidence for at least three transcribed BoLA class 1 loci (1994) Immunogenetics, 39, pp. 257-265; Gaskin, D.E., (1982) The Ecology of Whales and Dolphins, , Heinemann, London, U.K; Gatesy, J., More DNA support for a Cetacea-Hippopotamidae clade: The blood clotting fibrinogen gene gamma fibrinogen (1997) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 14, pp. 537-543; Hill, A.V.S., Allsopp, C.E.M., Kwiatkowski, D., Anstey, N.M., Twumasi, P., Rowe, P.A., Bennett, S., Greenwood, B.M., Common West African HLA antigens are associated with protection from severe malaria (1991) Nature, 352, pp. 595-600; Hoelzel, R.A., Claiborne, S.J., O'Brien, S.J., Molecular genetic diversity and evolution at the MHC DQB locus in four species of pinnipeds (1999) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 16, pp. 611-618; Hughes, A.L., Nei, M., Pattern of nucleotide substitution at major histocompatibility complex class I loci reveals overdominant selection (1988) Nature, 335, pp. 167-170; Jones, M.L., Swartz, S., Leatherwood, S., (1984) The Gray Whale Eschrichtus Robustus, , Academic Press, Orlando, FL; Jukes, T.H., Cantor, C.R., Evolution of protein molecules (1969) Mammalian Protein Metabolism, pp. 21-132. , H.

Box 1208, San Pedro, CA 90733-1208, United States","Every winter, most gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) of the eastern North Pacific stock migrate from feeding areas in the Arctic to warm, shallow lagoons in Mexico, covering a distance of 15 000-20 000 km roundtrip. It is hypothesized that this migration to warmer climes is undertaken to reduce the whales' thermoregulatory energy requirement during winter when food resources are low. Calves are particularly vulnerable as they have yet to acquire a thick layer of blubber. Prior to the mid-1970s, newborn calves were seen primarily in Mexico's lagoons. However, since 1980, shore-based observers have reported increased numbers of calf sightings north of Mexico. Calves were greatly under-represented in the shore-based records as rarely did more than one independent observer at a time recognize the presence of a calf and a strong nearshore preference was not evident from the aerial data. Although cows with calves Were difficult to detect, significant increases in average annual calf counts occurred at two counting stations in California, USA; counts increased in the late 1970s at a station near San Diego (southern California) and in the mid-1980s at a station near Carmel (central California). This trend is probably more than an increased emphasis on reporting calf sightings over the years for two reasons: (1) The first reports of calves stranding north of Mexico during the southbound migration occurred after 1976; and (2) calves were absent during many of the earlier censuses, and when they were seen, most appeared near the end of each migration. In subsequent years, calf sightings spread through the respective seasons, first at the southern stations (sometime after 1969) and then farther north (sometime after 1980). Increased calf counts at the northern stations were strongly correlated with warmer sea surface temperature anomalies. The interannual increase in calf sightings may be related to the increased abundance of the population, to changes in ocean climate, or to both factors. A one-week shift in the timing of the south-bound migration since 1980 placed the mean passage date for pregnant females near Carmel at 8 or 9 January, coinciding with earlier estimates of median calving date (10-13 January). Assuming the median parturition date has not changed, this would mean that nearly half of the calving now occurs north of Carmel.","Birth; Calf; California; Calving lagoons; Counting stations; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Mexico; Migration; Recovery","climate change; migration determinant; population size; range expansion; reproductive behavior; whale; winter; California; Carmel; Mexico [North America]; North America; San Diego; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Duffus, D.A., Langelier, K.M., An evaluation of gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) mortality incidental to fishing operations in British Columbia, Canada (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4 (3), pp. 289-296; Bodkin, J.L., Jameson, R.J., Patterns of seabird and marine mammal carcass deposition along the central California coast, 1980-1986 (1991) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 69, pp. 1149-1155; Buckland, S.T., Breiwick, J.M., Estimated trends in abundance of eastern Pacific gray whales from shore counts (1967/68 to 1995/96) (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4 (1), pp. 41-48; Coyle, K.O., Highsmith, R.C., Benthic amphipod communities in the northern Bering Sea: Analysis of potential structuring mechanisms (1994) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 107, pp. 233-244; Dohl, T.P., Guess, R.C., Duman, M.L., Helm, R.C., (1983) Cetaceans of Central and Northern California, 1980-1983: Status, Abundance, and Distribution.

Characteristics of this taxon, particularly of the petrosal, indicate that the new whale is a member of the clade that includes the Balaenopteridae (rorquals) and Eschrichtidae (gray whales) to the exclusion of “cetotheres” and the Balaenidae (right whales). Some of the probable synapomorphies of this clade include an elongate pars cochlearis, a tubular internal auditory meatus, the greater petrosal nerve foramen on the tympanic side of the petrosal, the stylomastoid fossa extending onto the posterior process of the petrosal, no medial groove on the pars cochlearis, four digits on each forelimb, depressed supraorbital processes, and ascending processes of maxillae extending onto the vertex. The approximate 14-million-year age of the specimen makes it the oldest known member of the clade by some 3 to 5 million years, and extends the fossil record of this clade closer to the divergence time estimated by some recent molecular studies. © 2004 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.",,"cetacean; cladistics; Miocene; whale; North America; United States; Virginia; Balaenidae; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, G.W., Unpublished report on diatoms of the Carmel Church Quarry (1985) United States Geological Survey E&R Report, p. 1; Andrews, G.W., A revised marine diatom zonation for Miocene strata of the southeastern United States.

Significant differences in haplotype, but not nucleotide, frequencies were also detected between cows in Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon's Lagoon) and non-lagoon females (n = 10; FST = 0.074, p &lt; 0.01) and between single females (n = 11) or adult males (n = 13) in Laguna San Ignacio and their non-lagoon counterparts (nfemales = 25, FST = 0.07, p &lt; 0.01; nmales = 28, FST = 0.08, p &lt; 0.01). These data suggest that all animals exhibit some level of site fidelity to their natal lagoons as adults, and that the eastern North Pacific gray whale population may be substructured on the population's wintering grounds.",,"DNA; Ecosystems; Ocean habitats; Gray whales; Lagoons; Biodiversity; habitat use; mitochondrial DNA; philopatry; population structure; whale; Baja California; Mexico [North America]; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); Animalia; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Laguna; Mammalia",,,,,,,,,"Amos, W., Hoelzel, A.R., Long-term preservation of whale skin for DNA analysis (1991) Rep.

However, recent research in the Ensenada whalewatching area confirms that this law is insufficient in this area because whalewatching boats and other fishing, cruising, or drifting boats influence the behavior (swimming direction and velocity) of migrating gray whales. In the long term, the migration corridor might be displaced offshore, and whalewatching may become infeasible. This study proposes a management planning process to adapt regulations to this area, to promote adherence to regulations by encouraging selfregulation and strengthening law enforcement, and to enhance the tourist service on board. The actors involved were identified.","Coastal ecotourism; Ensenada; Gray whale; Management; Mexico; Whalewatching","Boats; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Management; Planning; Regulatory compliance; Whalewatching; Coastal engineering; coastal zone management; ecotourism; legislation; whale; Mexico; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus",,,,,"AsociaciÃ³n para la ConservaciÃ³n de la Cuenca AmazÃ³nica, ACCA

The cause of the mortalities remains unknown, but starvation resulting from a reduction in prey, especially in the Chirikov Basin, was suggested as the cause. In the 1980s, the Chirikov Basin was considered a prime gray whale feeding area, but there has been no recent comprehensive assessment of whale or prey distribution and abundance. In 2002, a 5-day survey for gray whales revealed restricted distribution in the basin and a 3- to 17-fold decline in sighting rates. To put these data in context, a retrospective summary of gray whale and benthic fauna distribution and abundance was undertaken. During the 1980s, gray whale sighting rates in the Chirikov Basin were highly variable. Ampeliscid amphipods dominated the benthos where gray whale sighting rates were highest. Available measures of biomass suggest a downturn in amphipod productivity from 1983 to 2000, when estimates of gray whale population size were increasing, suggesting that the whales simply expanded their foraging range. We encourage long-term study of the Chirikov Basin as a location where predator-prey responses to changing ocean climate can be researched, because decadal time series data are available.",,"Beaches; Biomass; Climate change; Data reduction; Fauna; Marine biology; abundance; foraging behavior; mortality; population distribution; predator-prey interaction; prey availability; whale; Bering Sea; Amphipoda; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,,"Berzin, A.A., Soviet studies on the distribution and numbers of gray whale in the Bering and Chukchi seas from 1968 to 1982 (1984) The Gray Whale, Eschrichtius robustus, pp. 409-419. , Edited by M.L.

Ecol. and Fisheries Management, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349, United States","Accurate age determination is fundamental to the study of population structure and individual growth rates of mysticete whales. Here the disequilibrium between 210Pb and 226Ra in the tympanic bullae of two mysticete whale species was investigated for use as a chronometer. Radiometric ageing depends upon accumulation of the naturally occurring radionuclide 226Ra (exclusive of other 238U decay-chain members) in the bullae and subsequent retention of its progeny 210Pb. Ages are determined from the 210Pb/226Ra activity ratio. Samples were obtained from five gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) with lengths of 4.5 (a neonate), 7.8, 8.7, 10, and 11.5 m, and two bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) with lengths of 12.9 and 17.4 m. In gray whales, radiometric ages were estimated in the three largest whales. In the neonate, the 210Pb/226Ra ratio was above one and was not usable. The 7.8-m gray whale was used to determine the initial 210Pb/226Ra ratio required for age determination. We propose a theory of gray whale bullae growth starting at the fetal stage with an open system (with a 210Pb/226Ra &gt; 1 and a fast growth rate), which transitions by 1 year old to a closed system (with a 210Pb/226Ra &lt;&lt; 1 and a slow growth rate). In both bowhead whales, radiometric age could not be estimated because the 210Pb/226Ra ratio was above one. The excess 210Pb in these bullae samples was likely accumulated from the whales' environment via prey, or in the case of the neonate gray whale, across the placental boundary. Our results indicate that the underlying assumptions of the 210Pb/226Ra radiometric ageing method may not hold true in bowhead whales. Successful application of this method to bowhead whales is therefore doubtful.",,"Growth kinetics; Population statistics; Radioisotopes; Radiometry; Age determination; Marine biology; age determination; lead isotope; radiometric method; radium isotope; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Pastor, T., Biological factors affecting variability of persistent pollutant levels in cetaceans (1999) J.

The highest concentrations of copper, iron, zinc, and manganese were found in liver; nickel and lead in heart, and cadmium in kidney. In all tissues analyzed, iron, zinc and copper were present in the highest concentrations; however, some whales also showed high levels of cadmium in the kidney which could be related to their diet. Elevated concentrations of copper were found only in the liver of one whale. In general, where low levels of iron were found in the liver, they were associated with poor nutrition. Lead, nickel, manganese and zinc levels in liver were within the normal range, indicating that these whales had not been exposed to high levels of these metals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prey types were collected near feeding whales and at sites where no whales were observed to ascertain whales' diets and to describe prey populations and distributions. Characteristics of prey that are examined include species composition, density, biomass, and size. Whales foraged for mysids, Holmesimysis sculpta being the most abundant species collected. Whales foraged near concentrated patches of porcelain crab zoeal larvae, composed primarily of Pachycheles rudis, 21-294 times the average density and biomass normally collected. Amphipod biomass, composed primarily of Ampelisca agassizi and A. careyi, was 160 ± 150 g/m2 where whales foraged. Larger amphipods, rather than higher density, resulted in higher amphipod biomass between years. Whales foraged where there was a high proportion (61%) of amphipods &gt;6 mm in length. Whales initially foraged for amphipods along the 20-m depth contour line; amphipod biomass was best developed and least variable at depths between 16 and 20 m.","Amphipods; Clayoquot Sound; Cryptomya; Diet; Eschrichtius robustus; Ghost shrimp; Gray whale; Mysids; Porcelain crab larvae","diet; foraging behavior; prey availability; whale; Canada; Ampelisca agassizi; Ampelisca careyi; Eschrichtius robustus; Holmesimysis sculpta; Pachychdes rudis",,,,,,,,,"Coyle, K.O., Highsmith, R.C., Arctic ampeliscid amphipods: Three new species (1989) Journal of Crustacean Biology, 9, pp. 157-175; Darling, J.D., Keogh, K.E., Steeves, T.E., Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) habitat utilization and prey species off Vancouver Island, B.C.

Whales were found stranded in the southeast Gulf of California. Individuals were in a juvenile stage; mean length of whales was 9.3 m for E. robustus and 7 m for P catodon. Sequence of metal concentrations was Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Mn&gt;Cd&gt;Pb in E. robustus, and Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Mn&gt;Pb in P. catodon. In E. robustus, highest concentrations of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn (17.2, 19.6, 0.9 and 388 μg g-1, respectively) were measured in liver, Cd (5.7 μg g-1) in kidney and Fe (1009 μg g-1) in muscle. In P. catodon, the highest levels of Cu, Fe and Pb (48.6, 5200 and 4.2 μg g-1 respectively) were found in liver, Cd and Zn (94 and 183 μg g-1) in kidney and Mn (8 μg g-1) in muscle. Metal concentrations reported here were not considered to contribute to the stranding of specimens. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J0P 1H0, Canada","Reeves, R.R., Okapi Wildlife Associates, 27 Chandler Lane, Hudson, Que. J0P 1H0, Canada","The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes aboriginal subsistence whaling to be distinct from commercial whaling, and these two broad categories of whaling are subject to different management approaches. This paper describes recent, ongoing and likely future whale hunts that qualify, or may qualify, for aboriginal subsistence status within the IWC's management framework. To ensure conservation of the whale populations, a forthright exposition of the origins, development and character of these hunts is needed in addition to stock assessment, a risk-averse catch limit algorithm and appropriate mechanisms within the whaling communities to ensure compliance. The hunts for Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) and Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Arctic and North Pacific, respectively, and Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Indonesia have long histories and local origins. Those for Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Lesser Antilles and at Tonga in the South Pacific were introduced by foreign commercial whalers. Whale hunting in the Philippines appears to have originated both locally and as a result of foreign influence. The relatively recent initiation of whaling for Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland required introduced technology but can be viewed as a modern adaptation of an ancient tradition. Consensus in deciding how to classify and manage non-industrial whaling has been, and will remain, elusive. Even with common definitions of key terms such as 'subsistence', 'commercial' and 'aboriginal', interpretations will depend on whether one's priorities are whale-centred or human-centred.","Bowhead Whale; Bryde's Whale; Conservation; Fin Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Minke Whale; Sperm Whale; Whales; Whaling","commercial activity; conservation management; subsistence; whale; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae",,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribbean Studies, 11, pp. 55-74; Adams, J.E., Shore whaling in St Vincent Island, West Indies (1973) Caribbean Quarterly, 19, pp. 42-50; Adams, J.E., Primitive whaling in the West Indies (1975) Sea Frontiers, 21, pp. 303-313; Adams, J.E., Last of the Caribbean whalemen (1994) Natural History, 103 (11), pp. 64-71; Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Akimichi, T., Asquith, P.J., Befu, H., Bestor, T.C., Braund, S.R., Freeman, M.M.R., Hardacre, H., Takahashi, J., (1988) Small-Type Coastal Whaling in Japan.

Most of their feeding takes place in the northern Pacific Ocean with opportunistic feeding taking place during their migrations and residence on the breeding grounds. The concentrations of organochlorines and trace elements were determined in tissues and stomach contents of juvenile gray whales that were taken on their Arctic feeding grounds in the western Bering Sea during a Russian subsistence harvest. These concentrations were compared to previously published data for contaminants in gray whales that stranded along the west coast of the US during their northbound migration. Feeding in coastal waters during their migrations may present a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals in some regions. The mean concentration (standard error of the mean, SEM) of ∑ PCBs [1400 (130) ng/g, lipid weight] in the blubber of juvenile subsistence whales was significantly lower than the mean level [27 000 (11 000) ng/g, lipid weight] reported previously in juvenile gray whales that stranded in waters off the west coast of the US. Aluminum in stomach contents of the subsistence whales was high compared to other marine mammal species, which is consistent with the ingestion of sediment during feeding. Furthermore, the concentrations of potentially toxic chemicals in tissues were relatively low when compared to the concentrations in tissues of other marine mammals feeding at higher trophic levels.

In addition, we conducted aerial surveys to determine offshore distribution of the migration in 1994 and 1995, measured day/night migration rates with thermal sensors in 1994-1996, and maintained concurrent replicate watches near the peak of each migration to estimate the proportion of the cow/calf pairs missed by the standard watch team. During good weather, we counted 325, 194, 407, 501, 440, 141, and 96 calves during 1994-2000, respectively. Correcting these counts for periods not on watch and for calves missed, produced final estimates of 945 calves (SE = 68.21) for 1994, 619 calves (SE = 67.19) for 1995, 1,146 calves (SE = 70.67) for 1996, 1,431 calves (SE = 82.02) for 1997, 1,388 calves (SE = 91.84) for 1998, 427 calves (SE = 41.10) for 1999, and 279 calves (SE = 34.79) for 2000. Calf production indices (calf estimate/total population estimate) are 4.2%, 2.7%, 4.8%, 5.8%, 5.5%, 1.7%, and 1.1% for the years 1994-2000, respectively. Fluctuations in calf production over this time period were positively correlated with the length of time that primary feeding habitat was free of seasonal ice during the previous year.","Arctic ice; Calf production; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whales; Reproduction; Surveys","aerial survey; ice cover; population estimation; reproduction; whale; (Northeast); California; Pacific Ocean; Piedras Blancas; United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,,,"Alho, J.M., Logistic regression in capture/recapture models (1990) Biometrics, 46, pp. 623-635; Blokhin, S.A., Investigations of gray whales taken in the Chukchi coastal waters, USSR (1984) The gray whale, pp. 487-509. , M.

Gray whales are observed there from May till November; they stay within 4-5 km of the coast at a depth of no more than 25 m. The whales keep moving and spend most of their time feeding intensively. The whales occur more often in the area adjacent to Pil'tun Bay than in the rest of the area. A preliminary estimation indicates that the Korean gray whale population includes no more than 100 specimens. In view of this, from now on, the eastern Sakhalin shelf should only be commercially exploited with special care.","Behavior; Distribution; Gray whale; Population size",,,,,,,,,,"Berzin, A.A., Blokhin, S.A., Gray Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk (1986) Priroda, (12), pp. 86-87; Blokhin, S.A., The Results of the Cruise of the R/V Tungus for the Cetacean Counting in the Coastal Waters of the Seas of the Russian Far East in June-october 1986 (1988) Nauchno-issledovatel'skie Raboty Po Morskim Mlekopitayushchim Severnoi Chasti Tikhogo Okeana v 1986-1987 gg.

Long-term sighting studies in Clayoquot Sound (CS), BC, indicate that approximately 35-50 individuals exhibit long-term fidelity to this site. To determine the sex composition (based on genetic sexing) of CS gray whales and to assess whether matrilineal site-fidelity occurs in CS, we collected skin biopsy samples from 16 CS individuals ('residents') and 41 samples from other areas (representative of the overall population in the ENP: 'non-residents'). A total of 27 polymorphic sites defined 24 haploytpes among the 57 samples sequenced for HV1 of the mtDNA control region. The nucleotide and haplotype diversities of these samples were 0.017 (SE = 0.0012) and 0.94 (SE = 0.0019), respectively. Neighbor-joining analysis revealed five lineages each of which contained haplotypes that were observed in both residents and non-residents. Residents did not differ significantly from non-residents, and no significant sex-ratio bias was found. These data suggest a level of diversity that is inconsistent with a severe historical bottleneck, and given the available sample size, do not indicate matrilineally directed fidelity to Clayoquot Sound.","Eschrichtius robustus; mtDNA control region; Sex ratio; Site-fidelity",,,,,,"American University, AU","We gratefully acknowledge the many individuals and organizations who contributed substantially to different aspects of the study.

Between June and September in 1996 and 1997 we carried out analyses of the density, biomass, and other measures of their primary prey species, and of whales' movement patterns in response to prey characteristics. The prey base consists of hyper-benthic mysids (family Mysidae), pelagic porcelain crab larvae (4 spp. of family Porcellanidae), benthic amphipods (family Ampeliscidae) and benthic ghost shrimp Callianassa californiensis. Whales foraged primarily for mysids, switching to porcelain crab larvae in August, and then to amphipods even later in the season when these organisms increased in body size. In 1997, whales rapidly switched from feeding on planktonic to benthic prey during mid-August. Sampling indicated low numbers of mysids and crab larvae at that time. Selection of amphipod prey was based on high biomass and a high proportion of individuals ≥6 mm in length. In parts of the study area gray whales did not return to forage on benthic amphipods when this size criteria was not met. A single whale departed from a ghost shrimp feeding ground because its search time for food was long, it achieved only a low biomass removal rate, and it was not able to find sufficient food each day. We show that gray whales are dynamic and selective foragers that switch prey and foraging tactics rapidly to take advantage of short-term availability of energy.","Benthos; Clayoquot Sound; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Plankton; Prey selection; Prey-switching","benthos; foraging behavior; plankton; prey selection; whale; British Columbia; Canada; Clayoquot Sound; Ampeliscidae; Amphipoda; Callianassa; Callianassa californiensis; Callianassidae; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Mysida; Mysidae; Neotrypaea californiensis; Porcellanidae; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,,"Braham, H.W., Distribution and migration of gray whales in Alaska (1984) The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), pp. 249-266. , Jones ML, Swartz S, Leatherwood S (eds).

We searched historical records and computerized stranding databases for evidence of ship strikes involving great whales (i.e., baleen whales and the sperm whale). Historical records suggest that ship strikes fatal to whales first occurred late in the 1800s as ships began to reach speeds of 13-15 kn, remained infrequent until about 1950, and then increased during the 1950s-1970s as the number and speed of ships increased. Of 11 species known to be hit by ships, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are struck most frequently; right whales (Eubalaena glacialis and E. australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whales (Physeter catodon), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are hit commonly. In some areas, one-third of all fin whale and right whale strandings appear to involve ship strikes. To assess contributing factors, we compiled descriptions of 58 collisions. They indicate that all sizes and types of vessels can hit whales; most lethal or severe injuries are caused by ships 80 m or longer; whales usually are not seen beforehand or are seen too late to be avoided; and most lethal or severe injuries involve ships travelling 14 kn or faster. Ship strikes can significantly affect small populations of whales, such as northern right whales in the western North Atlantic. In areas where special caution is needed to avoid such events, measures to reduce the vessel speed below 14 kn may be beneficial.","Mortality; Right whales; Ship collisions; Species conservation; Strandings","collision; mortality; shipping; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, G., (1980) Blue whale apparently killed by Ship, (PART II), p. 8. , Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, CA. 8 July; Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Boston Society of Natural History.

On average, during the first six recording days, active wakefulness accounted for 37.9 ± 1.7% of each 24 h; transitional stage for 17.4 ± 1.4% and rest for 41.2 ± 1.7%. In the rest stage the whale was lying on the bottom of the pool (13.2 ± 1.7%) or hanging on the surface (28.0 ± 1.7%). During the rest stage, it was immobile most of the time and moved only for respiration. In the rest stage both eyes could be open, one eye could be open while the other was closed or, more rarely, both eyes could be closed. Characteristic jerks of the head, neck and sometimes of the whole body were observed in the whale during the rest stage. Most jerks were single and only 10% of all jerks were serial (occurring within 10 s of a prior jerk). Eyelid movements accompanied 40% of jerks. In two episodes, intense jerks followed each other continuously for 3 and 4 s and were accompanied by eyelid movements. These jerks resembled the twitches characteristic of paradoxical sleep in terrestrial mammals. During these episodes the whale was falling slowly onto its side and subsequently started to swim in the pool.","Cetaceans; Gray whale; Jerks; Paradoxical sleep; REM sleep; Rest","animal behavior; animal experiment; article; body movement; breathing pattern; controlled study; eye movement; female; nonhuman; physical activity; priority journal; REM sleep; rest; videorecorder; wakefulness; whale; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Rest; Sleep, REM; Swimming; Videotape Recording; Wakefulness; Whales",,,,,,,,,"Amlaner, C.J., Ball, N.J., Avian sleep (1994), pp. 81-94. , M.

Groningen, PO Box 14, 9750 AA, Haren, Netherlands","At least 31 species of marine mammals, marine and coastal birds, and marine and anadromous fish have disappeared temporarily or permanently from the coasts of The Netherlands and in most cases also from the south-eastern North Sea (south of 54°N) during the past 2000 years. In 18-22 cases, the disappearance was probably due to overexploitation. For 9-12 species, physical destruction of their habitat was involved and, for 3-5 species, pollution probably played a part. Five species have returned to the area; these are doing very well. Three species may return through expansion of populations elsewhere. Anadromous fish and demersal fish species that have disappeared because of bottom-trawling in the North Sea have little chance of returning under the present conditions. For the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) suggestions are made to investigate the possibilities for reintroduction.

The peptide binding region of MHC is the most polymorphic part of the molecule and analysis of the variation and synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution ratios in gray whale sequences found these genes to display polymorphism characteristics similar to that attributed to selection in other species.",,"DNA; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; amino acid substitution; article; DNA polymorphism; evolution; exon; gene locus; gene sequence; genome; major histocompatibility complex; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; priority journal; sequence homology; ungulate; whale; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA, Complementary; Exons; Genes, MHC Class I; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Whales","GENBANK: AB008136, AB008626, AB008627, AF014001, AF014003, AF014004, AF074426, AF074429, AF149216, AF149217, AF149218, AF149219, AF149220, AF149221, AF149222, AF149223, AF149224, AF149225, AF149226, L04950, L42623, L76934, M21043, M21044, M95409, M95410, U07665, U07676, U21052, U33807, U35625, U41379, U47325, U47328, U47329, U88874, X79891","DNA, Complementary",,,"University of New Mexico, UNM

Magdalena Bay is located at the southernmost point of the gray whale's annual breeding migration along the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. Standardized surveys were conducted for three consecutive seasons (1997-1999) in Magdalena Bay, enabling an assessment of the changes in the relative abundance of gray whales with altered temperature. The average temperature of the bay in 1998 was 4.2°C higher than in 1997 and 5.8°C higher than in 1999. The number of whale sightings during that time period was inversely related to temperature, with nearly 15 times greater relative abundance observed in 1999 than in 1998. It is hypothesized that the decreasing temperatures associated with the La Nina event of 1999 may have induced more whales to travel farther south along their migration route. Alternative hypotheses are also explored. Comparisons of the three years are discussed with consideration of the importance of environmental conditions versus area fidelity as determining factors in the location of gray whale calving and breeding activities.","Breeding lagoons; Distribution; El Nino; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; La Nina; Magdalena Bay; Mexico; Relative abundance","El Nino; migration; population distribution; relative abundance; whale; Mexico",,,,,,,,,"Alvarez-Borrego, S., Galindo Bect, L.A., Chee Barragan, A., Caracteristicas hidroquimicas de Bahia Magdalena, B.C.S (1975) Ciencias Marinas, 2, pp. 94-110; Blokhin, S.A., Observations of gray whales in their foraging areas in the Bering Sea, 1984 (1986) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 36, pp. 283-285; Bryant, P.J., Lafferty, C.M., Lafferty, S.K., Reoccupation of Laguna Guerrero Negro, Baja California, Mexico, by gray whales (1984), pp. 375-387. , M.

Distinct habitats were described for bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), white whales (Delphinapterus leucas), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) on the basis of habitat selection ratios calculated for bathymetric and ice cover regimes. In summer, bowheads selected continental slope waters and moderate ice conditions; white whales selected slope and basin waters and moderate to heavy ice conditions; and gray whales selected coastal/shoal waters and open water. In autumn, bowheads selected inner shelf waters and light ice conditions; white whales selected outer shelf and slope waters and moderate to heavy ice; and gray whales selected coastal and shoal/trough habitats in light ice and open water. Habitat differences among species were significant in both seasons (ANOVA F > 28, p < 0.00001). Interseasonal depth and ice cover habitats were significantly different for bowhead whales (p < 0.00002), but not for gray whales (p > 0.35).

Habitat selection indices were calculated for bowhead, white, and gray whales in heavy, moderate, and light ice conditions; and for high, moderate, and low transport (inflow) conditions at Bering Strait. Bowhead whales selected shallow inner-shelf waters during moderate and light ice, and deeper slope habitat in heavy ice conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.05-0.001). White whales selected slope habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.001), and gray whales selected coastal/shoal and shelf/trough habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.025-0.001), in all ice conditions. In the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, bowheads selected shelf waters and white whales chose slope waters, without regard to transport conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.01-0.001). In the northern Chukchi Sea, gray whales selected coastal/shoal habitat in high transport conditions (χ2, p &lt; 0.005), and shelf/trough habitat (χ2, p &lt; 0.001) during moderate and low transport conditions. Variability in distribution and habitat selection among these species is likely linked to prey availability at dissimilar trophic levels, although this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested.","Alaska; Arctic; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Gray whale; Habitat selection; White whale","aerial survey; arctic environment; cetacean; habitat selection; spatial distribution; (North); Alaska; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Monodontidae",,,,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., The Beaufort undercurrent (1984), pp. 47-71. , Barnes, P.W., Schell, D.M., and Reimnitz, E., eds.
