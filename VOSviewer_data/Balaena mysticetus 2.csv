Yet societal as well as scientific perceptions of these baselines are often based on ecosystems that have been deeply transformed by human actions. Despite increased awareness about the pervasiveness and implications of this shifting baseline syndrome, ongoing global assessments of the state of biodiversity do not take into account the long-term, cumulative, anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. Here, we propose a new framework for documenting such impacts, by classifying populations according to the extent to which they deviate from a baseline in the absence of human actions. We apply this framework to the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) to illustrate how it can be used to assess populations with different geographies and timelines of known or suspected impacts. Through other examples, we discuss how the framework can be applied to populations for which there is a wide diversity of existing knowledge, by making the best use of the available ecological, historical and archaeological data. Combined across multiple populations, this framework provides a standard for assessing cumulative anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.

Since the early 2000s, monitoring efforts along the coast of northern Alaska have indicated a higher proportion of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the southern Beaufort Sea (SB) subpopulation coming onshore to feed on subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) carcasses during the fall and early winter seasons. Concurrently, Indigenous communities annually hunt bowhead whale and deposit the unused remains at localized “bone piles,” creating the potential for human-bear interactions. Our objective was to determine the annual number of polar bears feeding at the bone pile near Kaktovik, Alaska. Using a hair snag surrounding the bone pile, we collected hair samples to identify individual bears via microsatellite genotypes during 2011 – 14. We used capture-mark-recapture data in the POPAN open-population model to estimate the number of bears visiting the bone pile. We estimated that as many as 72 (SE = 9) and 76 (SE = 10) male and female polar bears, respectively, used the bone pile located at Kaktovik, Alaska, in 2012, which represents approximately 16% of the SB polar bear subpopulation. It will be important to monitor the number of bears using the bone pile and subsequent human-bear interactions and conflicts along the northern coast of Alaska, if sea ice continues to recede. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Bone pile; Onshore behavior; Polar bear; Southern Beaufort Sea; Ursus maritimus; Whale carcass","bear; behavioral response; community structure; feeding behavior; fitness; food availability; mark-recapture method; native species; population dynamics; subpopulation; whale; winter; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barter Island; Beaufort Sea; Kaktovik; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1147384

Using stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (δ15N and δ13C) in polar bear Ursus maritimus guard hairs, we examined their diet in the Canadian Beaufort Sea from 2003 to 2011. We investigated how δ15N and δ13C were related to population demographics, sea ice dynamics, climate indices, air temperatures, and ringed seal Pusa hispida ovulation rates. Bayesian stable isotope models were used to determine annual variation in prey contributions and niche widths. Diet contributions from ringed seal, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, beluga Delphinapterus leucas, and bearded seal Erignathus barbatus varied by sex, reproductive status, and year. Polar bear ringed seal consumption was lowest and niche widths were highest in 2004 following ringed seal reproductive failure in the early 2000s, and polar bear δ15N decreased when ringed seal ovulation rate was high. Polar bear δ15N and δ13C were linked to capture locations, which may reflect geographic gradients in stable isotopes within the Beaufort Sea. Climate indices were not related to polar bear δ15N and δ13C. Sea ice dynamics were related to polar bear δ13C, suggesting that the bears' diets shift in response to environmental change. Overall, these results highlight the biological link between polar bears and ringed seals, as well as sea ice dynamics, and the importance of considering geographic location in stable isotope studies. © 2019 Inter-Research.","Beaufort Sea; Diet; Environmental change; Niche width; Polar bear; Sea ice dynamics; Stable isotopes; Ursus maritimus","annual variation; bear; community dynamics; diet; environmental change; predator; sea ice; stable isotope; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"Association of Zoos and Aquariums, AZA

We examined interyear matches (between 1985 and 2011) from a photo identification project and identified whales that had acquired entanglement injuries. We estimated the probability of a bowhead acquiring an entanglement injury using two statistical methods: interval censored survival analysis and a simple binomial model. Both methods give similar results, suggesting a 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1%–3.3%) annual probability of acquiring a scar. We also include an entanglement scar frequency analysis of aerial photographs from the 2011 spring and fall surveys near Point Barrow, Alaska, which suggest 12.4% of live bowheads show evidence of entanglement scarring. Entanglement rates for the BCBS bowhead stock are lower than many other large whale stocks, and abundance has increased over the past 35 yr; however, our findings indicate that fishing gear entanglement is a more serious concern for the BCBS bowhead whale population than previously thought. © 2019 Society for Marine Mammalogy","aerial survey; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; bowhead whale; bycatch; entanglement; injury; marine mammal; photo-identification; scarring","aerial photography; bycatch; commercial activity; fishing gear; injury; open water; probability; sea ice; stock identification; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi; Point Barrow; Russian Federation; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS

Within the Beaufort Sea, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) either use offshore areas and follow sea ice retreat (pelagic) or utilize nearshore areas (coastal), exposing individuals to different food sources. We examine the relationship between coastal and pelagic space use patterns and diet quantified by stable isotopes (δ15N and δ13C) of polar bears in the Beaufort Sea between 2007 and 2011. We examined spatial fidelity using home range overlap and assigned bears to one of two space use patterns (coastal or pelagic) based on proximity of home ranges to the coast. We estimated diet composition using inter- and intratissue variability in stable isotopes from hair and claws to examine seasonal shifts in diet. Sectioning of claws provided additional insights on diet, but guard hair sections did not. Polar bears showed spatial fidelity between years. Nitrogen stable isotopes were related to space use patterns. Coastal bears were 15N-depleted compared to pelagic bears due to coastal bears being enriched in 15N possibly from either scavenging on bowhead whale carcasses (Balaena mysticetus) killed during subsistence hunts or pelagic bears being nutritionally stressed. Although upper trophic level predators can provide insight into trophic dynamics and changes in ecosystem function, knowledge of space use patterns and foraging behavior is an important aspect of diet interpretation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beaufort sea; Polar bears; Space use; Stable isotopes; Ursus maritimus","activity pattern; bear; diet; ecosystem function; foraging behavior; ice retreat; niche overlap; site fidelity; space use; stable isotope; trophic level; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"Association of Zoos and Aquariums, AZA

Laboratory experiments testing effects of oils on material strength and flexibility, particle capture and tissue architecture of baleen from four mysticete species (bowhead, Balaena mysticetus; North Atlantic right, Eubalaena glacialis; fin, Balaenoptera physalus; humpback, Megaptera novaeangliae) indicate that baleen is hydrophilic and oleophobic, shedding rather than adsorbing oil. Oils of different weights and viscosities were tested, including six petroleum-based oils and two fish or plankton oils of common whale prey. No notable differences were found by oil type or whale species. Baleen did not adsorb oil; oil was readily rinsed from baleen by flowing water, especially from moving fringes. Microscopic examination shows minimal wrinkling or peeling of baleen's cortical keratin layers, probably due to oil repelling infiltrated water. Combined results cast doubt on fears of baleen fouling by oil; filter porosity is not appreciably affected, but oil ingestion risks remain. Particle capture studies suggest potentially greater danger to mysticetes from plastic pollution than oil. © 2019 The Authors.

Bowhead whales are one of the least encephalized cetaceans and occupy a basal phylogenetic position among mysticetes. Therefore, the bowhead whale is an important specimen for understanding the evolutionary specializations of cetacean brains. Here, we present an overview of the structure and cytoarchitecture of the bowhead whale cerebral cortex gleaned from Nissl-stained sections and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with other mysticetes and odontocetes. In general, the cytoarchitecture of cetacean cortex is consistent in displaying a thin cortex, a thick, prominent layer I, and absence of a granular layer IV. Cell density, composition, and width of layers III, V, and VI vary among cortical regions, and cetacean cortex is cell-sparse relative to that of terrestrial mammals. Notably, all regions of the bowhead cortex possess high numbers of von Economo neurons and fork neurons, with the highest numbers observed at the apex of gyri. The bowhead whale is also distinctive in having a significantly reduced hippocampus that occupies a space below the corpus callosum within the lateral ventricle. Consistent with other balaenids, bowhead whales possess what appears to be a blunted temporal lobe, which is in contrast to the expansive temporal lobes that characterize most odontocetes. The present report demonstrates that many morphological and cytoarchitectural characteristics are conserved among cetaceans, while other features, such as a reduced temporal lobe, may characterize balaenids among mysticetes.

We used ancient DNA methodology to identify the species of 52 large whale bones found along the coast of the Norwegian mainland. Nucleotide sequence variation of the mitochondrial control region (CR) was determined and subsequently screened against GenBank for species identification. Thirty-one bones (60%) yielded informative nucleotide sequences for the targeted mitochondrial CR. Of these, 24 matched with bowhead whale. Two additional bones were identified to bowhead whale based on morphology. Thus, 26 of the bones were identified to be from bowhead whales. The ages of the bowhead bones ranged from 15,084 cal years BP to present, with most bones older than 10,000 cal years BP. We suggest that our results show a change in distribution of bowhead whales from the very southern Norwegian Sea in the Heinrich Stadial 1 (19,000–14,600 years BP) to a distribution reaching 64°N in the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial (14,600–12,900 years BP), while the species probably was absent along the Norwegian coast during the cold Younger Dryas (12,900–11,700 years BP). During the Holocene, the species most likely has had only a northern distribution. The present study does not contribute new knowledge to solve the question if North Atlantic bowhead whales originated from a refugium in the southeast Atlantic during the Last Glacial Maximum or originate from the Pacific. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aDNA;

As part of marine mammal monitoring and mitigation for a seismic acquisition program August 25–September 30, 2014, we recorded marine mammal occurrence in a ~ 30 km 2 survey area between the Spy Islands and Oliktok Point near Simpson Lagoon using a combination of visual and acoustic monitoring methods. Visual effort totaled 632 h, occurring 18–20 h/day during all daylight hours by observers aboard three small survey vessels. In addition, an Iñupiat observer and seal hunter from the village of Nuiqsut conducted a small-vessel survey to investigate locations of Phoca largha haul-out sites. A total of 102 individual marine mammals were recorded from five species: P. largha, Pusa hispida, Ursus maritimus, Erignathus barbatus, and Delphinapterus leucas. Over 400 h of acoustic data were recorded using second-generation Ecological Acoustic Recorders deployed on the seafloor at three locations. Calls were identified for D. leucas, Balaena mysticetus, E. barbatus, and P. hispida. Results provide valuable information on marine mammal occurrence for the Beaufort Sea CRD during summer/fall, an area proposed for potential offshore oil and gas development. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Delphinapterus leucas; Passive acoustic monitoring; Phoca largha","acoustic data; acoustic survey; marine mammal; monitoring; seafloor; visual analysis; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Colville River; Oliktok Point; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus barbatus; Mammalia; Phoca hispida; Phoca largha; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Aerts, L.A.M., McFarland, A., Watts, B., Lomac-MacNair, K., Seiser, P., Wisdom, S., Kirk, A., Schudel, C., Marine mammal distribution and abundance in the offshore sub-region of the northeastern Chukchi Sea during the open-water season (2013) Continental Shelf Res, 67, pp. 116-126; Allen, B.M., Angliss, R.P., (2013) Alaska marine mammal stock assessments, 2013. , National oceanography atmosphere administrator technical memorandum NMFS-AFSC-277; Au, W.L., Carder, D.A., Penner, R.H., Scronce, B.L., Demonstration of adaptation in beluga whale echolocation signals (1985) J Acoust Soc Am, 77, pp. 726-730; Beier, J.C., Wartzok, D., Mating behaviour of captive spotted seals (Phoca largha) (1979) Anim Behav, 27, pp. 772-781; Blackwell, S.B., Richardson, W.J., Greene, C.R., Jr., Streever, B., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) migration and calling behaviour in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, Autumn 2001–2004: an acoustic localization study (2007) Arctic, 60, pp. 255-270; Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald, T.L., Greene, C.R., Thode, A.M., Guerra, M., Macrander, M.A., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (2013) Mar Mamm Sci, 29, pp. 342-365; Boveng, P.L., Bengtson, J.L., Buckley, T.W., Cameron, M.F., Dahle, S.P., Kelly, B.P., Megrey, B.A., Williamson, N.J., (2009) Status review of the spotted seal (Phoca largha).

Though this lamellated structure is often used to age a whale, its formation and development remain undescribed. It is thought that growth layer groups (GLGs) are laid down annually, thereby increasing the size of this structure. Since some mysticete whales are migratory and many undergo molting, we hypothesized that the cyclical production of these GLGs may be related to these processes. The epithelia of both EAM and glove finger (a part of the tympanic membrane protruding into the EAM) of one juvenile and multiple adult bowhead whales from both fall (October: non-molting) and spring (May: molting) seasons were dissected and examined anatomically and histologically. These tissue samples were compared with the adult oral epithelia at the same time periods. These epithelia shared a similar basic broad structure, though there were differences in thickness and presence of intraepithelial structures. All epithelia in the October specimens were rich in both glycogen and lipid. The parakeratinized epithelium of the oral cavity in the juvenile and some May specimens shed via the production of several superficial epithelial fissures. Other adult May specimens exhibited deep epithelial fissures, reminiscent of pressure ulcers, which would cause the detachment of the entire epithelium from the dermis. We propose that sloughed epithelial lining is the source of the GLGs in the ear plug. Correlating a potential molting sequence with these observations explained the presence of epidermal glycogen, deep epidermal fissures and dermal glycolipid, and to some extent calls into question the origin and structure of the ear plug itself. Further morphological characterization of ear plugs in bowheads is needed to better understand cell origin and ear plug formation. © 2018 Anatomical Society","bowhead whale; epithelium; external auditory meatus; seasonality","glycogen; lipid; adult; age determination; animal tissue; Article; autumn; bowhead whale; cell structure; controlled study; decubitus; eardrum; epithelium; external auditory canal; female; glove finger; histology; male; migratory species; molting; mouth epithelium; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; sample size; seasonal variation; skin epithelium; spring; anatomy and histology; animal; bowhead whale; ear; molting; population migration; season; Animal Migration; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Ear; Female; Male; Molting; Seasons",,"glycogen, 9005-79-2; lipid, 66455-18-3",,,,,"Adachi, K., Metabolism of glycogen in the skin and the effect of X-rays (1961) J Invest Dermatol, 37, pp. 381-395; Blokhin, S.A., Investigations of gray whales taken in the Chukchi coastal waters, U.S.S.R (1984) The Gray Whale Eschrichtius Robustus, pp. 487-509. , (eds, Jones ML, Swartz SL, Letherwood S, London, Academic Press, Inc; Braham, H.W., Distribution and migration of gray whales in Alaska (1984) The Gray Whale ESCHRICHTIUS ROBUSTUS, pp. 249-266. , (eds, Jones ML, Swartz SL, Letherwood S, London, Academic Press, Inc; Chernova, O.F., Shpak, O.V., Kildaze, A.B., Summer molting of bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus Linnaeus, 1958, of the Okhotsk sea population (2016) Dokl Biol Sci, 471, pp. 261-265; Chittleborough, R.G., Determination of age in the humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre) (1959) Aus J Mar Freshwater Res, 10, pp. 125-143; Clapham, P.J., Age at attainment of sexual maturity in humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (1992) Can J Zool, 70, pp. 1470-1472; Dorsey, E.M., Stern, J., Hoelzel, A.R., Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) from the west coast of North America: individual recognition and small-scale site fidelity (1990) Rep Manage Int Whaling Commission, (Special issue 12), pp. 357-368; Drury, R.A.B., Wallington, E.A., (1980) Carelton's Histological Technique, , 5th edn, Oxford, Oxford University Press; Edsberg, L.E., Pressure ulcer tissue histology: an appraisal of current knowledge (2007) Ostomy Wound Manage, 53 (10), pp. 40-49; Falin, L.I., Glycogen in the epithelium if mucous membranes and skin and its significance (1961) Acta Anat, 46, pp. 244-276; Fortune, S.M.E., Koski, W.R., Higdon, J.W., Evidence of molting and the function of ‘rock nosing’ behavior in bowhead whales in the eastern Canadian Arctic (2017) PLoS ONE, 12. , 0186156; Fraser, F.C., Purves, P.E., Anatomy and function of the cetacean ear (1960) Proc R Soc Lond Ser B Biol.

Recent studies have suggested that this subpopulation appears to be increasing. Here, we report on unusual aggregations of bowhead whales within the Fram Strait. We present opportunistic and effort-corrected observations of bowhead whales made from a small expedition vessel during cruises in June (2015-2018). Bowhead whales were sighted on 85 occasions (220-227 whales). An aggregation in 2015 (n = 84 whales) and high numbers in 2018 (n = 104-110) exceeded all pre - vious records. The index of whale abundance was significantly higher in open water-leads (1.08-1.14 whales km-1 of survey effort) compared to areas with drift-ice (0.51-0.53 whales km-1). The highest abundance index was measured in deep waters where the bottom slope was relatively steep. Our findings highlight the temporal and spatial consistency of this species in areas with relatively loose ice cover (open water-leads) and steep slopes. It is unknown how global warming and resultant changes in ice-extent are going to affect bowhead whales within the Strait and whether they will find new feeding grounds due to an expanding open-ocean habitat. These slopes may become increasingly important to bowhead whales and Arctic top predators as a spring/early summer feeding ground. These relatively large numbers of bowhead whales are encouraging and can help direct future research monitoring programs to study the population ecology of these endangered whales. © The authors 2019.","Abundance; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Conservation; Fram Strait; Platform of opportunity; Svalbard stock","abundance index; aggregation behavior; endangered species; population ecology; sea ice; species conservation; subpopulation; whale; Arctic; Fram Strait; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,"Acknowledgements.

Given these changes can affect marine animals in a variety of ways, understanding the spatial and temporal distributions of Arctic marine animals is imperative. We use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the presence of marine mammals near Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada, from October 2016 to April 2017. We documented bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus Linnaeus, 1758) and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) vocalizations later into the autumn than expected, and we recorded bowhead whales in early April. We recorded ringed seal (Pusa hispida (Schreber, 1775)) vocalizations throughout our deployment, with higher vocal activity than in other studies and with peak vocal activity in January. We recorded bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus (Erxleben, 1777)) throughout the deployment, with peak vocal activity in February. We recorded lower bearded seal vocal activity than other studies, and almost no vocal activity near the beginning of the spring breeding season. Both seal species vocalized more when ice concentration was high. These patterns in vocal activity document the presence of each species at this site over autumn and winter and are a useful comparison for future monitoring. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

The bowhead whale ear plug is formed from annually molting lining of the EAM as the entire epithelium releases at the level of the stratum basale during the spring migration. Epithelial regeneration is mostly completed by the fall migration, remaining intact for 6–7 months before being torn off the following spring. Desmosomes are integral to cell–cell adhesion with connecting desmosomal cadherins desmoglein (dsg) and desmocollin (dsc). Paraffin sections of the oral cavity and EAM lining of spring and fall adult bowhead whales, as well as the EAM of spring-caught juvenile, were immunohistochemically examined for the presence of these cadherins. In all fall specimens, both cadherins occurred in all layers except the superficial keratinous layer of the oral cavity. In spring, three different conditions existed: (a) oral cavity of spring-caught adults had reduced cadherins, with superficial fissuring in its keratinized layer and vacuolation in the upper stratum spinosum; (b) EAM of juvenile spring-caught whales displayed fissuring with accompanying reduction of both cadherins in its superficial lining; and (c) EAM lining of spring-caught adults displayed deep fissures, reduced cadherins, and absence of dsc1 in the fissuring zone. These results suggest that shedding of skin layers in mammals, whether normal molting, pathological, or the result of injury and wound repair all revolve around desmosome function. The specific role, structure, and location of these two cadherins need to be further addressed. © 2019 American Association for Anatomy","desmosomes; ear plug; external acoustic meatus",,,,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI","Collection of Bowhead material was carried out under an NOAA‐NMFS permit (No. 17350‐01 and 17350‐02) to J.C.G.

In comparison with most terrestrial mammals, the extraordinary reduction of cetacean HR rarely has been explored. It has been shown that the decreased HR contributes to an increase of lifespan, and high efficiency of energy utilization which provides many advantages for cetacean adaptation into aquatic habitats. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the reduced HR in cetaceans remains unresolved until now. Branch models and branch-site models combined with analysis of protein functional differentiation, based on the maximum likelihood method have been used in the present research to test the molecular evolution acting on cetacean exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2), two vital molecules in the cAMP signal that controls HR. Our results show an accelerated evolution of Epac1 at the combined branch of Baleen whales and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus).Branch-site models have determined remarkable positive selection at the ancestor node of baleen whales with positively selected sites located in the protein catalytic domain. Furthermore, functional modification of Epac1 also has been detected in cetaceans. In addition, strong positive selection of Epac2 in the bowhead whale(Balaena mysticetus) with a lifespan of up to 200 years has been discovered as was seen for Epac1. These results suggest adaptive evolution of Epac1 and Epac2 in cetaceans, which might not only result in reduced HR, but also may contribute to extended lifespans and high effective energy utilization. © 2018, Science Press.

We measured the mercury (Hg) concentration and stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope compositions along baleen plates of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) harvested between 1988 and 1996 from the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort (BCB) and the Eastern Canada–West Greenland (EC–WG) populations. These measurements were compared among individuals and between populations to assess seasonal cycling and to determine if bowhead whales forage year-round rather than fasting in winter. Individuals from the BCB population had synchronous cycles with higher Hg concentrations and lower δ13C values in summer and lower Hg concentrations and higher δ13C values in winter. EC–WG individuals also had synchronized periodic variations with peak values in isotopic ratios during summer. These results reflect an annual cycle of seasonal migration between distinct food webs in both populations. Spring and fall feeding activity was indicated in the intra-annual Hg and δ13C cycles along the baleen plates of all whales in our study. These shorter periods, spanning about half the annual growth, have not been previously described in the baleen of these populations, and are consistent with separate foraging areas along the migration routes. The results of this study provide further support for year-round foraging in a species previously thought to fast during winter. Future monitoring of seasonal foraging patterns in baleen would help to determine whether bowhead whales alter their foraging patterns in response to shifts in zooplankton community availability, composition, and phenology. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Arctic; Baleen; Bowhead whale; Carbon; Mercury; Nitrogen; Stable isotopes; Time series","annual cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon isotope; fasting; feeding behavior; habitat use; mercury (element); movement; nitrogen isotope; population migration; stable isotope; time series analysis; whale; zooplankton; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Greenland; Pacific Ocean; West Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"International Arctic Research Center, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, IARC

We are deeply indebted to the late Dr. Don Schell who provided access to baleen collections and whose careful detective work provided us with the inspiration that we might be able to recover Hg records from these same plates that had been so instrumental in revising our understanding of bowhead biogeography.","Aguilar, A., Giménez, J., Gómez-Campos, E., Cardona, L., Borrell, A., δ 15N value does not reflect fasting in mysticetes (2014) PLoS ONE, 9. , PID: 24651388; (2011) AMAP assessment 2011: mercury in the arctic, p. 193. , Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), Oslo; Andersson, M.E., Sommar, J., Gardfeldt, K., Lindqvist, O., Enhanced concentrations of dissolved gaseous mercury in the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean (2008) Mar Chem, 110, pp. 190-194; Atwell, L., Hobson, K.A., Welch, H.E., Biomagnification and bioaccumulation of mercury in an arctic marine foodweb: insights from stable nitrogen isotope analysis (1998) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 155, pp. 1114-1121; Beaudin, L., Johannessen, S.C., Macdonald, R.W., Coupling laser ablation and atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry: an example using mercury analysis of small sections of fish scales (2010) Anal Chem, 82, pp. 8785-8788. , PID: 20942426; Bentaleb, I., Martin, C., Vrac, M., Mate, B., Mayzaud, P., Siret, D., de Stephains, R., Guinet, C., Foraging ecology of Mediterranean fin whales in a changing environment elucidated by satellite tracking and baleen plate stable isotopes (2011) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 438, pp. 285-302; Best, P.B., Schell, D.M., Stable isotopes in southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) baleen as indicators of seasonal movements, feeding and growth (1996) Mar Biol, 124, pp. 483-494; Bloom, N., Fitzgerald, W.F., Determination of volatile mercury species at the picogram level by low-temperature gas-chromatography with cold-vapor atomic fluorescence detection (1988) Anal Chim Acta, 208, pp. 151-161; Braune, B., Chételat, J., Amyot, M., Brown, T., Claydon, M., Evans, M., Fisk, A., Stern, G.A., Mercury in the marine environment of the Canadian Arctic: review of recent findings (2014) Sci Total Environ, 509-510, pp. 67-90. , PID: 24953756; Brown, T.M., Macdonald, R.W., Letcher, R.J., Muir, D.C.G., The distribution and trends of persistent organic pollutants and mercury in marine mammals from Canada’s Eastern Arctic (2018) Sci Total Environ, 618, pp. 500-517. , PID: 29145101; Caraveo-Patiño, J., Hobson, K.A., Soto, L.A., Feeding ecology of gray whales inferred from stable-carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis of baleen plates (2007) Hydrobiologia, 586, pp. 17-25; Chan, K.S., Ripley, B., (2012) TSA: Time Series Analysis, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TSA, R package version 1.01; Cherel, Y., Hobson, K.A., Bailleul, F., Groscolas, R., Nutrition, physiology, and stable isotopes: new information from fasting and molting penguins (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2881-2888; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., George, J.C., Small, R.J., Heide-Jorgensen, M.P., Bower, H., Adams, B., Brower, L., Winter movements of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Bering Sea (2012) Arctic, 65, pp. 13-34; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., Okkonen, S.R., Druckenmiller, M.L., Ecological characteristics of core-use areas used by Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort (BCB) bowhead whales, 2006–2012 (2014) Prog Oceanogr, 136, pp. 201-222; Corkeron, P.J., Connor, R.C., Why do baleen whales migrate?

The resulting extended ‘open water’ season has many implications for vessel traffic and marine life. For example, an increase in vessel traffic due to ice-free waters will most likely lead to an increased risk of impact on cetaceans through increased noise pollution, strike risk for some cetacean species, and the possibility of exposure to chemical pollutants. The objective of this study was to pre-empt a predicted increase in vessels by investigating and exploring possible management scenarios, with the aim of mitigating negative impacts on locally important species such as bowhead and beluga whales. Utilizing insights gained from established vessel management schemes in more southerly regions, this paper evaluates the current suite of tools being implemented and their appropriateness for implementation in a more extreme Arctic environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Noise pollution; Sea ice; Waterway transportation; Arctic environments; Beluga whales; Canadian Arctic; Chemical pollutants; Management scenarios; Management scheme; Northern regions; Sea ice extent; Water pollution; chemical pollutant; climate conditions; coastal zone management; marine environment; noise pollution; sea ice; vessel; whale; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas",,,,,"University of Victoria, UVic

Sightings of bowhead whales in the central Alaskan Beaufort Sea in September 1997 and September 2014 were unusual in that hundreds of whales were observed within a few kilometers of local barrier islands. We compare bowhead whale sightings, river discharge data, wind records, and satellite imagery to argue that the large numbers of bowhead whales observed nearshore in September 1997 and 2014 resulted from favorable feeding conditions established by high river discharges and prior upwelling events. These results are then generalized in a simple binary-based mechanistic framework that links the relevant physics to occurrences of observed and potential feeding opportunities for bowhead whales in the central Alaskan Beaufort Sea and in other locales along the Beaufort coast. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alaska; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Bowhead whale; Upwelling","Antennas; Rivers; Surveys; Alaska; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Bowhead whales; Upwelling; Satellite imagery; aerial survey; barrier island; methodology; river discharge; satellite imagery; upwelling; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI","This study is part of the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR) and was funded in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program through Interagency Agreement No. M11PG00034 with the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL).

Biological noise (consisting of the signals of bowhead whales, walrus and bearded seals) dominated the acoustic environment for the focal species in the St. Lawrence Island/Anadyr Strait region, which was covered with ice throughout the months studied. In the Bering Strait region whales were exposed primarily to environmental noise (in the form of wind noise) during November, before the region was ice-covered in December, and biological noise (from bowhead and walrus) again was prevalent. Anthropogenic noise dominated the Barrow Canyon region for the focal species in late summer and fall (August through October); this was also the only region in which the two species did not overlap with sea ice. Under open water conditions both near Barrow Canyon and in Bering Strait, noise levels were tightly correlated with wind. However, with climate-change driven increases in open water leading to rising noise levels across multiple fronts (atmospheric, biological, anthropogenic), the relatively pristine acoustic environment of Arctic cetaceans is changing rapidly. Characterizing the acoustic habitat of these regions before they are further altered should be considered a management and conservation priority in the Arctic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient noise; Arctic zone; Balaena mysticetus; Beluga whale; Bowhead whale; Delphinapterus leucas","Acoustics; Climate change; Sea ice; Ambient noise; Balaena mysticetus; Beluga whales; Bowhead whales; Delphinapterus leucas; Acoustic noise; ambient noise; anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; climate change; conservation management; habitat type; open water; seasonal variation; whale; Alaska; Anadyr; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Bering Strait; Chukchi; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Saint Lawrence Island; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Odobenidae",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: OPP-1107106

We also included one seasonal resident, eastern North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus, n = 12). This review summarized the distribution of daily locations from satellite-linked transmitters during two analysis periods, summer (May–November) and winter (December–April), and then examined the overlap among species. Six multi-species core use areas were identified during the summer period: 1) Chukotka/Bering Strait; 2) Norton Sound; 3) Kotzebue Sound; 4) the northeastern Chukchi Sea; 5) Mackenzie River Delta/Amundsen Gulf; and 6) Viscount Melville Sound. During the winter period, we identified four multi-species core use areas: 1) Anadyr Gulf/Strait; 2) central Bering Sea; 3) Nunivak Island; and 4) Bristol Bay. During the summer period, four of the six areas were centered on the greater Bering Strait region and the northwestern coast of Alaska and included most of the species we examined. The two remaining summer areas were in the western Canadian Arctic and were largely defined by the seasonal presence of Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock bowhead whales and Eastern Beaufort Sea stock beluga whales, whose distribution overlapped during both summer and winter periods. During the winter period, the main multi-species core use area was located near the Gulf of Anadyr and extended northwards through Anadyr and Bering Straits. This area is contained within the Bering Sea “green belt” an area of enhanced primary and secondary productivity in the Bering Sea. We also described available telemetry data and where they can be found as of 2017. These data are important for understanding ice-associated marine mammal movements and habitat use in the Pacific Arctic and should be archived, with appropriate metadata, to ensure they are available for future retrospective analyses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Balaena mysticetus; Bearded seal; Beaufort Sea; Beluga whale; Bering Sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea; Core area; Delphinapterus leucas; Distribution; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Pacific walrus; Pusa hispida; Ringed seal","Mammals; Satellites; Telemetering equipment; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Beluga whales; Bering sea; Bowhead whales; Chukchi Sea; Core area; Delphinapterus leucas; Distribution; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Gray whale; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Pacific walrus; Pusa hispida; Ringed seals; Population distribution; biotelemetry; marine mammal; pinniped; range size; satellite data; seasonality; secondary production; species diversity; species occurrence; stock assessment; whale; Alaska; Amundsen Gulf; Anadyr Basin; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bering Strait; Bristol Bay; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Chukchi; Gulf of Anadyr; Kotzebue Sound; Norton Sound; Nunivak Island; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia; Odobenus rosmarus divergens; Phoca hispida; Phoca largha",,,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI","This analysis was conducted for the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR) and was funded in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Environmental Studies Program through Interagency Agreement No. M11PG00034 with the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory ( PMEL ).

The majority of whales summer in the eastern Beaufort Sea and winter in the Bering Sea, migrating across the Chukchi Sea in fall and spring. As arctic sea-ice extent rapidly diminishes, the increasing length and variability of the open water season is changing bowhead habitat substantially, with many areas now regularly ice-free when whales are present. This study examines changes in the number of open water days (OWD) between 1979 and 2014 within annual bowhead whale core-use areas as defined by satellite tagging data, and within the western Beaufort Sea (140–157°W; to 72°N) sampled by fall aerial surveys. Ice cover has decreased more in the core-use areas in the northern extent of the range than in core-use areas in the southern extent. The numbers of OWD within the core-use areas near Point Barrow and along the northern Chukotka Coast during peak use have increased by 13 and 10 days/decade, respectively. The most dramatic reductions in sea-ice cover have taken place in the western Beaufort Sea where the number of OWD on the shelf and slope have increased by 20 and 25 days/decade, respectively. In contrast, sea-ice cover has not significantly changed within the winter core-use area near the Gulf of Anadyr. Using aerial survey data, we found that bowheads in the Beaufort Sea during the fall migration have a preference for being closer to shore than to the ice edge, and that their distance to shore decreases as the fraction of open water increases. This distribution may be due to increased feeding opportunities closer to shore as a result of greater upwelling along the shelf break when the ice cover is farther from shore. Furthermore, the aerial survey data also revealed a substantial shift westward toward Point Barrow in the whales’ use of the western Beaufort Sea during fall in the period 1997–2014 compared to 1982–1996. The extent and timing of sea-ice coverage has changed relatively little over time in the Bering Sea. Bowheads typically migrate north prior to spring ice melt and retreat; therefore, large changes in the timing of the spring migration are not expected. We anticipate that bowheads will spend increasingly more time within summer and fall feeding areas, delaying their arrival to wintering areas in the Bering Sea. Reduced ice coverage and thickness in the southern Chukchi Sea may make wintering there more common in the future. Summer and fall movements may be more variable as productivity and zooplankton aggregations in existing feeding areas are altered in response to sea ice thinning and retreat, and as new areas become available. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic sea ice; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Bowhead whales; Chukchi Sea","Antennas; Ecosystems; Feeding; Information dissemination; Surveys; Arctic sea ice; Beaufort sea; Bering sea; Bowhead whales; Chukchi Sea; Sea ice; aerial survey; continental shelf; continental slope; habitat structure; ice cover; open water; population migration; sea ice; shelf break; upwelling; whale; zooplankton; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Gulf of Anadyr; Pacific Ocean; Point Barrow; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI","This study is part of the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR) and was funded in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program through Interagency Agreement No. M11PG00034 with the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL).

Routes whales use when crossing the Chukchi Sea vary by year; in some years, whales migrate directly to the northern coast of Chukotka while in other years, whales may pause migration and linger, presumably to feed, in the central Chukchi Sea. To investigate how whale movements may be related to oceanographic variables we examined bowhead whale habitat selection within the Chukchi Sea in autumn (September–November) at two spatial scales. First, at the landscape scale (i.e. the Chukchi Sea), we compare oceanographic variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, and current velocity) at locations within used and randomly available tracks (i.e. paths of travel) to determine how oceanographic features are associated with where whales cross the Chukchi Sea in autumn. Second, at a local scale, we examine how directed travel or lingering within a whale's track is associated with oceanographic variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, and current velocity). Whale location data for 24 bowhead whales were paired with oceanographic data from a pan-arctic coupled ice-ocean model for 2006–2009. At the landscape scale, we found that whales generally followed water of Pacific origin characterized by temperatures <0ºC and salinities between 31.5 and 34.25. Bowhead whales avoided Alaskan Coastal Water and Siberian Shelf Water, the latter of which defines the western limit of their range, likely due to lower intrinsic densities of zooplankton prey. At the local scale, within their tracks, whales were more likely to interrupt directed movements and linger in areas characterized by stronger gradients in bottom salinity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alaskan Coastal Current; Anadyr Water; Balaena mysticetus; Behavioral state-space model; Bering Shelf Water; Chukchi Sea; Correlated random walk; Resource selection","Oceanography; Research; Balaena mysticetus; Behavioral state; Chukchi Sea; Coastal currents; Correlated random walks; Resource selection; Shelf waters; State space methods; algorithm; autumn; coastal current; ecological modeling; habitat selection; ice-ocean interaction; migration; population density; population migration; salinity; shelf sea; temperature effect; whale; Alaska; Anadyr; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi; Chukchi Sea; Russian Federation; Russian Federation; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"Dental Foundation of Oregon, DFO

Sue Moore helped formulate our research questions and guided us through the SOAR initiative and two anonymous reviewers provided constructive criticism. Funding for tagging efforts was mainly provided by U.S. Minerals Management Service (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) under contracts M12PC00005 , M10PC00085 , and M05PC00020 , with the support and assistance from Charles Monnett, Jeffery Denton, and Carol Fairfield. Work in Canada was also funded by the Fisheries Joint Management Committee , Ecosystem Research Initiative (DFO), and Panel for Energy Research and Development . Bowhead whale research has been conducted in the U.S. under a Marine Mammal Protection Act permit issued to National Marine Fisheries Service (No. 782-1719) and to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (No. 14610) and under Animal Care and Use permit Nos. 06-16, 09-21, 10-13R, 12-020. In Canada, research was conducted under Department of Fisheries and Oceans Scientific License No. S-07/08-4007-IN, S-08/09-4000-IN, S-09/10-4005-IN-A1 and Animal Care Protocols FWI-ACC-2007-2008-013 and FWI-ACC-2008-031, and FWI-ACC-2009-019.","Ainley, D.G., Dugger, K.M., Toniolo, V., Gaffney, I., Cetacean occurrence patterns in the Amundsen and southern Bellingshausen sea sector, Southern Ocean (2007) Mar.

Growth layer groups (GLGs) in the involucrum of the tympanic bone were used to estimate age of the whales, and compared to stable isotope signatures along transects of baleen plates and the involucrum. The involucrum of the tympanic bone consists of three regions that form in utero, during nursing in the first year, and during the first decades of life, respectively. Life history events, such as annual migration, are recorded in the bowhead tympanic bulla. It is likely that bone growth in the bowhead tympanic occurs during periods of high food intake, while slow or arrested growth occurs during periods of low food intake. Comparisons between numbers of GLGs in the tympanic, number of isotopic oscillations in a baleen plate, length of the baleen plate, and total whale length show correlation coefficients as high as 0.97. The tympanic GLG method is particularly useful for estimating the age of whales up to 20 yr old. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy","Arctic; Balaena; GLGs; LAGs; stable isotopes; tympanic bulla","age determination; bone; food intake; histology; life history trait; morphology; stable isotope; whale; Arctic; Balaena; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the hunters and residents of Barrow Alaska for allowing sampling of the whales and for their trust and support.

This is particularly applicable for species that can “adaptively fast” by conserving protein to protect organ function while catabolizing endogenous tissues. Some Ursids, including polar bears (Ursus maritimus), adaptively fast during winter hibernation—and it has been suggested that polar bears also employ this strategy during summer. We captured 57 adult female polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) during summer 2008 and 2009 and measured blood variables that indicate feeding, regular fasting, and adaptive fasting. We also assessed tissue δ13C and δ15N to infer diet, and body condition via mass and length. We found that bears on shore maintained lipid and protein stores by scavenging on bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) carcasses from human harvest, while those that followed the retreating sea ice beyond the continental shelf were food deprived. They had low ratios of blood urea to creatinine (U:C), normally associated with adaptive fasting. However, they also exhibited low albumin and glucose (indicative of protein loss) and elevated alanine aminotransferase and ghrelin (which fall during adaptive fasting). Thus, the ~ 70% of the SBS subpopulation that spends summer on the ice experiences more of a regular, rather than adaptive, fast. This fast will lengthen as summer ice declines. The resulting protein loss prior to winter could be a mechanism driving the reported correlation between summer ice and polar bear reproduction and survival in the SBS. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Albumin;

During the 1800s and early 1900s commercial whaling greatly reduced the numbers of bowhead whales in waters adjacent to the North Atlantic Ocean. In recent decades their numbers have been increasing. Thirteen sightings of a bowhead whale were recorded in four areas of the Gulf of Maine in 2012, 2014, and 2017 between latitudes 44°43’N and 41°36’N, far south of the normal range (54°N) for this species. Photographs obtained during these sightings were compared by experienced photo analysts and, based on scarring patterns, the sightings were confirmed to be of the same individual. The bowhead whale was observed alone, in addition to interacting in a social group and engaged in coordinated feeding with other mysticetes at times. The feeding and social behaviour of the bowhead whale was typical for the species but well south of its normal Arctic waters range and in the absence of conspecifics. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

Two baleen whales sing complex songs that change annually, though only the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) has received much research attention. This study focuses on the other baleen whale singer, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). Members of the Spitsbergen bowhead whale population produced 184 different song types over a 3-year period, based on duty-cycled recordings from a site in Fram Strait in the northeast Atlantic. Distinct song types were recorded over short periods, lasting at most some months. This song diversity could be the result of population expansion, or immigration of animals from other populations that are no longer isolated from each other by heavy sea ice. However, this explanation does not account for the within season and annual shifting of song types. Other possible explanations for the extraordinary diversity in songs could be that it results either from weak selection pressure for interspecific identification or for maintenance of song characteristics or, alternatively, from strong pressure for novelty in a small population. © 2018 The Authors.","Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Song","immigration; population distribution; sea ice; song; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Fram Strait; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; animal; Atlantic Ocean; bowhead whale; physiology; season; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; time; vocalization; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Bowhead Whale; Seasons; Svalbard; Time; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,"Data accessibility.

Data from shore-based observation posts provides spatial and temporal information about whale distribution and migration in the coastal zones, as well as information about their relative numbers. The spring migration was observed only from Uelen, Russia (66°N, 149°W), near the northwestern entrance to the Bering Strait, and extended from the end of May through the first half of June. Some year-to-year differences in numbers and migration dynamics were observed. During summer, bowhead whales were sighted in the waters of the northern coast of Chukotka Peninsula in July and August. In 2010–2012, single whales and small groups of up to 4–8 whales were observed in the area for days making non-directed movements. Our observations in 2010–2012 demonstrated that many bowhead whales visited Chukotka coast in the autumn (September) before sea ice formation. From past observations, it appears that the autumn migration begins 2–3 weeks earlier on the northwestern coast of the Chukotka Peninsula than in the (northern) entry of the Bering Strait. The autumn migration of bowhead whales began with ice formation and ended with the complete freezing of the waters. Ice conditions appear to drive high variability in timing of the bowhead autumn migration. The northeastern Chukotka coast is one of the most important feeding areas for the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) bowhead whale population. © 2018 International Whaling Commission.

AD 1250 to present) responses to the decreased temperatures of the Little Ice Age (LIA) climate change episode (ca. AD 1300-1900) in the Foxe Basin region of central Nunavut, Arctic Canada. Cooler temperatures (and increased sea ice) would be expected to have reduced both bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) habitats, forcing Neo-Inuit to refocus their hunting activities on landfast-ice-dwelling small seals (e.g., Pusa hispida) during winter months. However, an analysis of faunal remains from Foxe Basin's largest-known Neo-Inuit (Thule, historic and modern Inuit) archaeological site, Pingiqqalik (NgHd-1), reveals a long-term subsistence economy based largely on multi-seasonal walrus hunting. Two interrelated factors may explain these results: (1) a system of recurring polynyas provided a degree of ecological stability for local walrus populations, and (2) the development of a distinctive walrus caching regime-a form of which continues among the region's contemporary Inuit-allowed residents to adeptly exploit an ecological niche, thereby ensuring food security. Together, these factors likely insulated northern Foxe Basin Neo-Inuit from the worst effects of the LIA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada

Recorders were deployed in a roughly linear array configuration near the edge of the shorefast ice bordering the open lead. The recorded acoustic data were analysed from 156 sample periods comprising a total of 331 hours coincident with the visual census. Bowhead sounds in the sample periods were found by manual inspection of multi-channel sound spectrograms of the array recordings. Source locations for bowhead sounds that were received on three or more sensors within the array were calculated using a robust localisation algorithm. Very high levels of bowhead acoustic activity were observed in comparison to recording efforts undertaken during past censuses, including high rates of singing and call sequences. A total of 22,426 bowhead sounds yielded 15,647 reliable locations. Of these, 6,944 were within the rectangular aperture zone directly in front of the array and therefore used in the calculation of a new population estimate.

Potential inﬂuences of stress or adrenal stress hormones (cortisol, corticosterone) on male reproduction have also been diﬃcult to study. Baleen has recently been shown to accumulate steroid hormones during growth, such that a single baleen plate contains a continuous, multi-year retrospective record of the whale's endocrine history. As a preliminary investigation into potential testosterone cyclicity in male whales and inﬂuences of stress, we determined patterns in immunoreactive testosterone, two glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone), and stable-isotope (SI) ratios, across the full length of baleen plates from a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), a North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), all adult males. Baleen was subsampled at 2 cm (bowhead, right) or 1 cm (blue) intervals and hormones were extracted from baleen powder with methanol, followed by quantiﬁcation of all three hormones using enzyme immunoassays validated for baleen extract of these species. Baleen of all three males contained regularly spaced peaks in testosterone content, with number and spacing of testosterone peaks corresponding well to SI data and to species-speciﬁc estimates of annual baleen growth rate. Cortisol and corticosterone exhibited some peaks that co-occurred with testosterone peaks, while other glucocorticoid peaks occurred independent of testosterone peaks. The right whale had unusually high glucocorticoids during a period with a known entanglement in ﬁshing gear and a possible disease episode; in the subsequent year, testosterone was unusually low. Further study of baleen testosterone patterns in male whales could help clarify conservation- and management-related questions such as age of sexual maturity, location and season of breeding, and the potential eﬀect of anthropogenic and natural stressors on male testosterone cycles. © The Author(s) 2018.

The habitat use data allowed for direct comparison with data collected in the same area from 1982 to 1991. Both species are ice-adapted, migrating through leads in sea ice in spring, and are seasonal inhabitants of the western Beaufort Sea during summer and fall. From 2009 to 2016, bowhead whales were seen in all survey months, with the highest overall sighting rate (whales per km) in August. Bowhead sighting rates were highest in the whales’ preferred habitats: outer shelf habitat (51-200 m depth) in July and inner shelf-shallow habitat (≤ 20 m depth) in August, September, and October. Beluga whales were also seen in all survey months, with highest overall sighting rate in July. Beluga whales were overwhelmingly associated with continental slope habitat (201-2000 m depth) in all months. Bowhead whale distribution and depth preferences in summer months of 2009-16 differed from those observed in 1982-91, when bowheads were not seen during limited survey effort in July and preferred outer continental shelf habitat in August. These differences indicate that bowhead whale preference for shallow shelf habitat now occurs earlier in summer than it used to. Beluga whale distribution and depth preference remained similar between 1982-91 and 2009-16, with strong preference for continental slope during both periods. Differences in sea ice cover habitat association for both species are likely due more to the relative lack of sea ice in recent years compared to the earlier period than to shifts in habitat preference. Habitat partitioning between bowhead and beluga whales in the western Beaufort Sea remained evident except in July, when both species used continental slope habitat. In July-October 2009-16, the distribution, sighting rates, and behavior of both bowheads and belugas in the western Beaufort showed considerable interannual variation, which underscores the importance of annual sampling to accurate records of the complex western Beaufort Sea ecosystem. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aerial survey; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Beluga whale; Bowhead whale; Delphinapterus leucas; Feeding; Habitat","aerial survey; continental shelf; continental slope; feeding; geographical distribution; habitat selection; habitat use; ice cover; line transect; migration; niche partitioning; sea ice; vertical distribution; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia",,,,,,"Funding for and co-management of aerial surveys in the western Beaufort Sea were provided by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Region (formerly, the Minerals Management Service) under Interagency Agreement Nos.

Microscopic features included lipomatous and myelolipomatous masses. Extensive atrophy and/or destruction of hepatic parenchyma was not observed. No other significant disease was present except in an animal with unrelated chronic pleuritis. Based on our longitudinal case series (1980-2016) which identified 1-2 hepatic lipomas and myelolipomas in landed whales annually at Barrow, Alaska (USA), since 2012, hepatic lipomas and myelolipomas are occasionally seen in hunter-harvested bowhead whales. A conservative estimate for the percentage of bowhead whales with hepatic fatty tumors in landed whales in Barrow from 2012 to 2016 was 6% (7/111). The pathogenesis and exact cell origin of these benign fatty tumors in bowhead whales is undetermined. Assessment of further cases is warranted to better define the tissue distribution and pathogenesis of these tumors in bowhead whale liver.","Aboriginal whaling; Alaska; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Hepatic lipoma; Hepatic myelolipoma","disease; literature review; pathogenicity; spatiotemporal analysis; tumor; whale; whaling; Alaska; Barrow; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Alaska; animal; Cetacea; female; lipoma; liver tumor; male; myelolipoma; pathology; veterinary; Alaska; Animals; Female; Lipoma; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Myelolipoma; Whales",,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS","Acknowledgements.

We used bulk stable isotope analysis and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of individual amino acids (AA) to examine bowhead whale trophic position and the biogeochemistry of one of their feeding grounds, Disko Bay, West Greenland, over a period of 7 years (2007–2013). We also examined whether environmental conditions such as sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature were causing any interannual variation in isotope data. Bulk δ15N values were consistent across the 7 years of sampling and were similar between sex classes. Bulk δ13C and essential-AAs δ13C values displayed an overall temporal decline of 1.0 and 1.4‰, respectively. A significant positive linear relationship was found between δ13C of bulk skin and essential-AAs suggesting that some of the observed isotopic variation in bowhead whales between years reflect changes in the carbon at the base of the food web. There were no correlations between the δ13C and δ15N values of isotopic tracers with sea ice concentrations or sea surface temperatures. The trophic level of bowhead whales remained stable over time despite large interannual variability in ice and temperature regimes. Our results indicate that the recent environmental changes in West Greenland resulted in no trophic perturbation being transferred to bowhead whales during that time period. Our study shows that the novel approach of CSIA-AA can be used effectively to study the combined temporal variation of bowhead whale food web structure and ecosystem isotopic baseline values and detect changes at the species and ecosystem levels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Amino acids;

Longitudinal delamination and detachment of thin or thick sheets of a considerable area have been established for the surface layer (stratum externum) of the whale epidermis during molting. A correlation of molting intensity to the level of proliferation and regeneration of all epidermal layers has been noted and assumed to stabilize the thickness of the skin. The phenomenon of molting is discussed from the viewpoint of adaptation of the whales to the conditions of the shallow bays of the Sea of Okhotsk that warm up thoroughly in the summer. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,,,,,"Ocean Park Conservation Foundation, Hong Kong, OPCFHK

However, relatively little is known about the occurrence of molting and associated behaviors in bowhead whales. We opportunistically observed whales in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada with skin irregularities consistent with molting during August 2014, and collected a skin sample from a biopsied whale that revealed loose epidermis and sloughing. During August 2016, we flew a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) over whales to take video and still images to: 1) determine unique individuals; 2) estimate the proportion of the body of unique individuals that exhibited sloughing skin; 3) determine the presence or absence of superficial lines representative of rock-rubbing behavior; and 4) measure body lengths to infer age-class. The still images revealed that all individuals (n = 81 whales) were sloughing skin, and that nearly 40% of them had mottled skin over more than two-thirds of their bodies. The video images captured bowhead whales rubbing on large rocks in shallow, coastal areas—likely to facilitate molting. Molting and rock rubbing appears to be pervasive during late summer for whales in the eastern Canadian Arctic. © 2017 Fortune et al.

The drilling operation involved a number of vessels performing various activities, such as towing the drill rig, anchor handling, and drilling. Acoustic data were collected with six arrays of directional recorders (DASARs) deployed on the seafloor over ~7 weeks in Aug–Oct. Whale calls produced within 2 km of each DASAR were identified and localized using triangulation. A “tone index” was defined to quantify the presence and amplitude of tonal sounds from industrial machinery. The presence of airgun pulses originating from distant seismic operations was also quantified. For each 10-min period at each of the 40 recorders, the number of whale calls localized was matched with the “dose” of industrial sound received, and the relationship between calling rates and industrial sound was modeled using negative binomial regression. The analysis showed that with increasing tone levels, bowhead whale calling rates initially increased, peaked, and then decreased. This dual behavioral response is similar to that described for bowhead whales and airgun pulses in earlier work. Increasing call repetition rates can be a viable strategy for combating decreased detectability of signals arising from moderate increases in background noise. Meanwhile, as noise increases, the benefits of calling may decrease because information transfer becomes increasingly error-prone, and at some point calling may no longer be worth the effort. © 2017 Blackwell et al.

In this study, an acoustic recorder deployed on an oceanographic mooring in western Fram Strait documented the soundscape of this area, which is important habitat for the Critically Endangered Spitsbergen bowhead whale population. The soundscape was quasi-pristine much of the year, with low numbers of ships traversing the area. However, during summer/autumn, signals from airgun surveys were detected > 12 h/day. Mean received peak-to-peak SPLs for loud airgun pulses reached 160.46 ± 0.48 dB 1 μPa when seismic-survey ships were close (at ~ 57 km). Bowhead whales were present almost daily October–April in all years, with singing occurring in almost every hour November–March. Currently, loud anthropogenic sound sources do not temporally overlap the peak period of bowhead singing. This study provides important baseline data for future monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Airguns; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Passive Acoustic Monitoring; Seismic; Shipping","Freight transportation; Sea ice; Seismology; Ships; Surveys; Air guns; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Passive acoustic monitoring; Seismic; Ferroelectric RAM; arctic environment; breeding site; cetacean; monitoring; seismic noise; shipping; underwater noise; Arctic; autumn; bowhead whale; breeding; habitat; human; monitoring; nonhuman; ship; shipping; singing; sound; summer; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; animal; Arctic; bowhead whale; endangered species; physiology; reproduction; sound; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; vocalization; Arctic; Fram Strait; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bowhead Whale; Endangered Species; Reproduction; Sound; Svalbard; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"219999/E10

Baleen refers to the food-filtering system of Mysticeti whales; a full baleen rack consists of dozens of plates of a tough and flexible keratinous material that terminate in bristles. Due to its properties, baleen was a valuable raw material used in a wide range of artefacts, from implements to clothing. Baleen is not widely used today, however, analyses of this biomolecular tissue have the potential to contribute to conservation efforts, studies of genetic diversity and a better understanding of the exploitation and use of Mysticeti whales in past and recent times. Fortunately, baleen is present in abundance in museum natural history collections. However, it is often difficult or impossible to make a species identification of manufactured or old baleen. Here, we propose a new tool for biomolecular identification of baleen based on its main structural component alpha-keratin (the same protein that makes up hair and fingernails). With the exception of minke whales, alpha-keratin sequences are not yet known for baleen whales. We therefore used peptide mass fingerprinting to determine peptidic profiles in well documented baleen and evaluated the possibility of using this technique to differentiate species in baleen samples that are not adequately identified or are unidentified. We examined baleen from ten different species of whales and determined molecular markers for each species, including species-specific markers. In the case of the Bryde’s whales, differences between specimens suggest distinct species or sub-species, consistent with the complex phylogeny of the species. Finally, the methodology was applied to 29 fragments of baleen excavated from archaeological sites in Labrador, Canada (representing 1500 years of whale use by prehistoric people), demonstrating a dominance of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in the archaeological assemblage and the successful application of the peptide mass fingerprinting technique to identify the species of whale in unidentified and partially degraded samples. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Occasionally, Inuvialuit hunters and others observe beachcast (stranded) or adrift Bowhead Whale carcasses. From 1987 to 2016, 26 such occurrences were recorded. Most (65%) were found by Inuvialuit hunters travelling on the land, with the majority (54%) reported during 2000/2006. Bowhead Whale carcasses were found widely distributed throughout the region, with twice as many in Amundsen Gulf (65%) compared with the southeastern Beaufort Sea (35%). It was possible to measure or estimate standard length for 17 of 26 specimens, and all were either provisional 'subadults' (7/9.5 m; n = 10; 59%) or provisional 'mature adults' (13/16 m; n = 7; 41%). The cause(s) of mortality was not determined for any of the specimens. Whales in the 'subadult' group were likely 1/4 years old, while the 'mature adult' group were likely mostly mature animals (~25 y), including some potentially very old (>100 y). There was evidence or direct observation of Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus) and/or Grizzly Bears (U. arctos) scavenging at 60% of the carcasses for which presence or absence of bears or bear sign (scats and/or tracks) was reported. It is important to continue to record incidental observations of beachcast Bowhead Whales, as this may enable stranding rates to be evaluated. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2017.","Amundsen Gulf; Balaena mysticetus; Beachcast; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead Whale; Stranding","adult; bear; body size; detritus; mortality; new record; population migration; scavenging (feeding); stranding; whale; Amundsen Gulf; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Ursus arctos; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,"We gratefully acknowledge the many people who reported and/or investigated the beachcast Bowhead Whales in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.

A deposit of blue and colorless gem corundum (Beluga occurrence) is compared to a similar calc-silicate pod generally lacking corundum but containing nepheline (Bowhead occurrence) and located 170 m to the SSW. Corundum formation was made possible by three equally important sequential metamorphic reactions: (1) formation of nepheline, diopside, and K-feldspar (inferred) at granulite facies peak metamorphic conditions; (2) partial retrograde replacement of the peak assemblage by phlogopite, oligoclase, calcite, and scapolite (Me50-Me67) as a result of CO2-, H2O-, Cl-, F-bearing fluid influx at 1782.5 ± 3.7 Ma (P-T &lt; 720 °C, 6.2 kbar); and (3) retrograde breakdown of scapolite + nepheline (with CO2- and H2O-bearing fluid) to form albite, muscovite, corundum, and calcite. Late, lowtemperature zeolite mineralization is common in corundum-bearing zones. Based on thermodynamic models, the corundumforming reaction only occurs in a &lt;100 °C window with an upper limit determined by scapolite-nepheline stability, and a lower limit determined by the formation of Al-silicate rather than corundum. The protolith is inferred to be dolomitic argillaceous marl with no evidence to suggest the initial presence of evaporites. The enrichment of trace metals V and Cr, and the depletion of Co, Ni, and Mn, suggest reducing diagenetic conditions in the initial sediment. Beluga calc-silicate rock is strongly depleted in REE (Total REE ~ 18 ppm). Oxy-dravite δ11B (+3.9 ± 0.7%0) is consistent with a marine boron source. The oxygen isotope composition of corundum (δ18OVSMOW=16.4 ± 0.1%0) is comparable to that of corundum in marble or desilicated pegmatite associated with marble. Phlogopite and muscovite 40Ar/39Ar ages and calculated closure temperatures (considered estimates) are ca. 1640 Ma (Tc = 455 to 515 °C) and 1510 Ma (Tc = 410 to 425 °C), respectively. In the Lake Harbour Group, the most prospective areas for gem corundum exploration are expected to be contiguous to the thrust fault separating the Lake Harbour Group and Narsajuaq terranes, where the retrograde, amphibolite facies overprint of the granulite peak assemblages was most pervasive.","Calc-silicate rock; Corundum; Gem deposits; Marble; Metamarl; Nepheline; Proterozoic; Sapphire; Scapolite","Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Corundum; Deposits; Faulting; Fertilizers; Lakes; Marble; Mica; Sapphire; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Trace elements; Metamarl; Nepheline; Proterozoic; Scapolite; Silicate rocks; Corundum deposits; amphibolite facies; boron; corundum; granulite; granulite facies; marble; marl; mineral exploration; mineralization; muscovite; oxygen isotope; rare earth element; scapolite; thrust fault; Baffin Island; Canada; Nunavut; Balaena mysticetus",,,,,,,"Baccar, M.B., Fritz, B., Made, B., Diagenetic albitization of K-feldspar and plagioclase in sandstone reservoirs: Thermodynamic and kinetic modeling (1993) Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 63, pp. 1100-1109; Belley, P.M., Grice, J.D., Fayek, M., Kowalski, P.M., Grew, E.S., A new occurrence of the borosilicate serendibite in tourmaline-bearing calc-silicate rocks, Portage-du-Fort marble, Grenville Province, Qu'ebec: Evolution of boron isotope and tourmaline compositions in a metamorphic context (2014) Canadian Mineralogist, 52, pp. 595-616; Beranek, L.P., Mortensen, J.K., The timing and provenance record of the Late Permian Klondike orogeny in northwestern Canada and arc-continent collision along western North America (2011) Tectonics, 30, p.

They can, however, be challenging to estimate, have been presented in inconsistent ways, and are not widely used. Methods: We review the literature on integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity models and propose four fundamental correlated velocity movement models (CVM's): random, advective, rotational, and rotational-advective. The models are defined in terms of biologically meaningful speeds and time scales of autocorrelation. We summarize several approaches to estimating the models, and apply these tools for the higher order task of behavioral partitioning via change point analysis. Results: An array of simulation illustrate the precision and accuracy of the estimation tools. An analysis of a swimming track of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) illustrates their robustness to irregular and sparse sampling and identifies switches between slower and faster, and directed vs. random movements. An analysis of a short flight of a lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) identifies exact moments when switches occur between loopy, thermal soaring and directed flapping or gliding flights. Conclusions: We provide tools to estimate parameters and perform change point analyses in continuous time movement models as an R package (smoove). These resources, together with the synthesis, should facilitate the wider application and development of correlated velocity models among movement ecologists. © 2017 The Author(s).","Balaena mysticetus; Correlated random walk; Correlated velocity movement; Falco naumanni; Integrated ornstein-uhlenbeck process; Thermal soaring; Velocity autocovariance function",,,,,,,,"Nathan, R., Getz, W.M., Revilla, E., Holyoak, M., Kadmon, R., Saltz, D., Smouse, P.E., A movement ecology paradigm for unifying organismal movement research (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 105 (49), pp. 19052-19059; Nams, V.O., Sampling animal movement paths causes turn autocorrelation (2013) Acta Biotheor, 61 (2), pp. 269-284; McClintock, B.T., Johnson, D.S., Hooten, M.B., Hoef, J.M.V., Morales, J.M., When to be discrete: the importance of time formulation in understanding animal movement (2014) Mov Ecol, 2 (21); Patlak, C.S., A mathematical contribution to the study of orientation of organisms (1953) Bull Math Biophys, 15, pp. 431-476; Kareiva, P.M., Shigesada, N., Analyzing insect movement as a correlated random walk (1983) Oecologia, 56, pp. 234-238; Dray, S., Royer-Carenzi, M., Calenge, C., The exploratory analysis of autocorrelation in animal-movement studies (2010) Ecol Res, 25, pp. 673-681; Jonsen, I.D., Flemming, J.M., Myers, R.A., Robust state-space modeling of animal movement data (2005) Ecology, 86 (11), pp. 2874-2880; Fortin, D., Morales, J.M., Boyce, M.S., Elk winter foraging at fine scale in Yellowstone National Park (2005) Oecologia, 145 (2), pp. 334-342; Gurarie, E., Ovaskainen, O., Characteristic spatial and temporal scales unify models of animal movement (2011) Am Nat, 178, pp. 113-123; Turchin, P., Fractal analyses of animal movement: a critique (1996) Ecology, 77 (7), pp. 2086-2090; Gurarie, E., Andrews, R.D., Laidre, K.L., A novel method for identifying behavioural changes in animal movement data (2009) Ecol Lett, 12 (5), pp. 395-408; Johnson, D.S., London, J.M., Lea, M.A., Durban, J.W., Continuous-time correlated random walk model for animal telemetry data (2008) Ecology, 89 (5), pp. 1208-1215. , http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/07-1032.1; Fleming, C.H., Calabrese, J.M., Mueller, T., Olson, K.A., Leimgruber, P., Fagan, W.F., Likelihood estimation of autocorrelated movement processes (2014) Methods Ecol Evol; Gurarie, E., Grünbaum, D., Nishizaki, M., Estimating 3d movements from 2d observations using a continuous model of helical swimming (2011) Bull Math Biol, 73 (6), pp. 1358-1377; Alt, W., Biological Motion: Proceedings of a Workshop Held in Königswinter Germany (1990), pp. 254-268. , In: Alt W, Hoffmann G, editors.

Rapid changes in Arctic sea ice ecosystems have increased the need to identify critical habitats for conservation and management of species such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus). We examined the distribution of adult female and subadult male and female polar bears tracked by satellite telemetry (n = 64 collars) in the southern Beaufort Sea, Canada, to identify summer refugia in 2007–2010. Using utilization distributions, we identified terrestrial and sea ice areas used as summer refugia when nearshore sea ice melted. Habitat use areas varied between months, but interannual variation was not significant. Overall, bears made high use of ice over shallow waters, and bears that remained near terrestrial areas used sea ice (presumably to hunt from) when it was available. The majority of the bears remained on sea ice during summer and used the edge of the pack ice most notably west of Banks Island, Canada. A mean of 27 % (range 22–33 %) of bears used terrestrial areas in Alaska and use was concentrated near the remains of subsistence harvested bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). Energetic expenditure is anticipated to increase as bears are required to travel further on a seasonal basis. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Beaufort Sea; Distribution; Kernel density; Polar bear; Sea ice; Ursus maritimus","bear; bioenergetics; biotelemetry; climate change; habitat availability; habitat use; pack ice; polar region; population distribution; probability density function; refuge; sea ice; summer; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Banks Island; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Northwest Territories; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"Environment and Natural Resources, Northwest Territories, ENR, NWT

We describe the seasonal occurrence of marine mammals and the spatial distribution of their calls in Baffin Bay and Melville Bay. Four Autonomous Multichannel Acoustic Recorders (AMARs) were deployed during summer 2012 (late July to early October), five recorders during September 2013, and two recorders from late September 2013 to early September 2014. The call presence of several species was analyzed using automatic call detection and manual verification analysis methods. A novel approach to discern narwhal (Monodon monoceros) clicks from beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) clicks was implemented during the verification process. Narwhal calls were detected in spring and fall, showing a south-to-north migration pattern in spring and a north-to-south migration pattern in fall. Few beluga whales were detected during fall 2013 and spring 2014. Bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) calls were detected mainly during spring (mating period). A small number of bowhead whale calls (Balaena mysticetus) were detected during fall 2013 and spring and summer 2014. For the first time at this latitude in Baffin Bay, long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were detected during summer and fall. Our results suggest that the presence of marine mammals in Baffin Bay and Melville Bay is governed mainly by the annual cycle of sea ice formation and decay. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Baffin bay; Bearded seals; Beluga clicks; Beluga whales; Bowhead whales; Long-finned pilot whales; Melville bay; Narwhal clicks; Narwhals; Northwest Greenland; Passive acoustic monitoring; Sperm whales","acoustic method; bioacoustics; biomonitoring; migration; pinniped; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; species occurrence; trend analysis; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Greenland; Melville Bay; West Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Globicephala melas; Mammalia; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,"University of Washington, UW

We had 904 records in our database for whales landed between 1990 and 2012, and after data quality screening, we found 521 records containing information on scarring. Logistic regression was used to evaluate different combinations of explanatory variables (i.e., body length, sex, year, year-group) to develop a prediction model for each scar type. We also list bowhead whales that were harvested, found dead, or observed alive entangled in commercial line/fishing gear. Our findings suggest that about 12% of harvested bowheads show entanglement scars. Their frequency is highly correlated with body length and sex: about 50% of very large bowheads (> 17 m) show such scars, while whales under 9 m rarely do, and males show a significantly higher rate than females. Scars associated with ship strikes are infrequent and occur on ~2% of all harvested whales; body length, sex, and year were not significant factors. Scarring from attempted killer whale predation was evident on ~8% of landed whales. As with entanglement injuries, the frequency of killer whale scars was much higher (> 40%) on whales more than 16 m in length and statistically more frequent in the second half of the study (2002 – 12). Increased killer whale injuries in the recent decade are consistent with studies conducted on bowheads of the Eastern Canada-West Greenland population. The findings presented here reflect the most thorough analysis of injury rates from entanglement, ships, and killer whales for the BCB bowheads conducted to date. They indicate that (1) entanglement rates primarily from pot fishing gear (crab or cod or both) are relatively high for very large and presumably older bowheads, (2) collisions with ships are infrequent at present, and (3) scarring from killer whales is frequent on very large adult whales (> 17 m). Considering that bowhead habitat is changing rapidly (e.g., sea ice reduction), industrial ship traffic in the Arctic is increasing, and commercial fishing operations are expanding to the north, we strongly recommend that monitoring of scarring and injuries on harvested bowheads continue into the future as a means of documenting change. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aboriginal whaling; Arctic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Bering Sea; Bowhead whale; Commercial gear entanglement; Killer whale predation attempts; Line entanglement; Orcinus orca; Propeller injuries; Scars; Ship strike","commercial species; data quality; database; equipment; fishing gear; habitat type; harvesting; numerical model; ship design; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Greenland; Pacific Ocean; West Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Orcinus orca",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: 814-1899, 932-1489, 1009, 17350, 782-1694","We thank all the whaling communities, and specifically Kaktovik, Barrow, Gambell, Point Hope, Savoonga, and Wainwright, for allowing us to examine their bowhead whales.

To test the potential generalizability of this technique for studies of stress and reproduction in large whales, we sought to determine whether all major classes of steroid and thyroid hormones are detectable in baleen, and whether these hormones are detectable in other mysticetes. Powdered baleen samples were recovered from single specimens of North Atlantic right, bowhead, blue (Balaenoptera [B.] musculus), sei (B. borealis), minke (B. acutorostrata), fin (B. physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whales. Hormones were extracted with a methanol vortex method, after which we tested all species with commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs, Arbor Assays) for progesterone, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, representing a wide array of steroid and thyroid hormones of interest for whale physiology research. In total, 64 parallelism tests (8 species × 8 hormones) were evaluated to verify good binding affinity of the assay antibodies to hormones in baleen. We also tested assay accuracy, although available sample volume limited this test to progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. All tested hormones were detectable in baleen powder of all species, and all assays passed parallelism and accuracy tests. Although only single individuals were tested, the consistent detectability of all hormones in all species indicates that baleen hormone analysis is likely applicable to a broad range of mysticetes, and that the EIA kits tested here perform well with baleen extract. Quantification of hormones in baleen may be a suitable technique with which to explore questions that have historically been difficult to address in large whales, including pregnancy and inter-calving interval, age of sexual maturation, timing and duration of seasonal reproductive cycles, adrenal physiology and metabolic rate. © The Author 2017.

Previous attempts to develop reliable methods of age determination for this species have included using body length and baleen length measurements, baleen carbon cycling analysis, assessments of corpora accumulation, and aspartic acid racemisation (AAR; conversion of L to D enantiomers) measurements. Each of these methods has its limitations. The primary objective of this study was to improve the AAR analysis technique for determining age in bowhead whales in order to obtain consistent, reproducible results for D/L ratios for estimated ages. Using a modified AAR method, lenses from 68 bowhead whales were analysed and ages estimated. A comparison of the results to previous ageing by corpora counting or baleen carbon cycling methods for 11 of the whales showed smaller standard errors for the AAR analyses. The modified AAR methods applied in this study increase the precision of D/L measurements and provide improved bowhead whale AAR results. © 2017 International Whaling Commission.

On 15 May 2016, a juvenile bowhead whale was recorded in shallow water in Mount's Bay (Cornwall, UK) much further south than the species' normal dis- tribution. Fifteen months earlier, another such sighting was made involving a juvenile bowhead whale in the shallow water of an offshore island, St Martin's (Isles of Scilly, Cornwall), only 60 km from Mount's Bay. Other observations of suspected/confirmed immature bowhead whales include (1) an unconfirmed sighting involving a whale without a dorsal fin off Cornwall (13 May 2016), (2) a confirmed sighting off France (10 May 2016), and (3) a confirmed sighting in Carlingford Lough (border of Northern Ireland/ Republic of Ireland; 29 May 2016). These extra- limital encounters present the first confirmed sightings of bowhead whales within temperate European waters. Apart from the whale sighted in 2015, the sightings in 2016 probably all involve the same juvenile whale. Indeed, photographs depicting natural scars/marks suggest that the Carlingford Lough bowhead whale is the same individual as the Mount's Bay. The whale was displaying behaviour indicative of ram feeding in a sheltered, shallow bay (< 10 m water depth). Do these records present vagrant animals from nearby endangered Arctic stocks? Whatever trig- gered these immature bowhead whales to venture well outside the Arctic Circle remains unknown, yet these observations suggest an unexpected adaptability to foraging in temperate shallow waters.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Feeding behaviour; Migration; Shallow waters; Vagrancy","feeding behavior; foraging behavior; juvenile; migration; shallow water; whale; England; France; Isles of Scilly; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Accardo, C.M., Ganley, L.C., Brown, M.W., Duley, P.A., George, J.C., Reeves, R.R., Mayo, C.A., Sightings of a bowhead whale (Balaena mys-ticetus) in the Gulf of Maine and its interactions with other baleen whales Journal of Cetacean Research and Management; Carroll, G., Smithhisler, J.R., Observations of bowhead whales during spring migration (1980) Marine Fisheries Review, 42, pp. 80-85; Dyke, A.S., Hooper, J., Savelle, J.M., A history of sea ice in the Canadian Arctic archipelago based on postglacial remains of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) (1996) Arctic, 49, pp. 235-255. , https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic1200; Ford, T.F., Jr., Werth, A.J., George, J.C., An intraoral thermoregulatory organ in the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), the corpus cavernosum maxil-laris (2013) The Anatomical Record, 296, pp. 701-706. , https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.22681; George, J.C., Zeh, J., Suydam, R., Clark, C., Abundance and population trend (1978-2001) of western Arctic bowhead whales surveyed near Barrow, Alaska (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20, pp. 755-773. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2004.tb01191.x; George, J.C., Druckenmiller, M., Laidre, K.L., Suydam, R., Person, B., Western Arctic bowhead whale body condition and links to summer sea ice and upwell-ing in the Beaufort Sea (2015) Progress in Oceanography, 136, pp. 250-262. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2015.05.001; Gilg, O., Born, E.W., Recent sightings of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in northeast Greenland and the Greenland Sea (2005) Polar Biology, 28, pp. 796-801. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-005-0001-9; Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Laidre, K., Borchers, D., Samarra, F., Stern, H., Increasing abundance of bow-head whales in west Greenland (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 577-580. , https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0310; Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Laidre, K.L., Jensen, M.V., Dueck, L., Postma, L.D., Dissolving stock discreteness with satellite tracking: Bowhead whales in Baffin Bay (2006) Marine Mammal Science, 22, pp. 34-45. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00004.x; Laidre, K.L., Stirling, I., Lowry, L.F., Wiig, Ø., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Ferguson, S.H., Quantifying the sensitivity of Arctic marine mammals to climate-induced habitat change (2008) Ecology Applications, 19, pp. S97-S125. , https://doi.org/10.1890/06-0546.1; Lambertsen, R.H., Rasmussen, K.J., Lancaster, W.C., Hintz, R.J., Functional morphology of the mouth of the bowhead whale and its implications for conservation (2005) Journal of Mammalogy, 86, pp. 342-352. , https://doi.org/10.1644/BER-123.1; Lowry, L.F., Sheffield, G., George, J.C., Bowhead whale feeding in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, based on stomach contents analyses (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6 (3), pp. 215-223; Lydersen, C., Freitas, C., Wiig, Ø., Bachmann, L., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Swift, R., Kovacs, K.M., Lost highway not forgotten: Satellite tracking of a bow-head whale (Balaena mysticetus) from the Critically Endangered Spitsbergen stock (2012) Arctic, 65, pp. 76-86. , https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic4167; Moore, S.E., Is it ""boom times"" for baleen whales in the Pacific Arctic region?

This onshore use has been linked to reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice, as well as to the availability of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) bone piles. Here, we evaluated the role of climate conditions on consumption of traditional ice-associated prey relative to onshore bowhead whale bone piles. We determined seasonal and interannual trends in the diets of SB polar bears using fatty acid-based analysis during this period of increasing land use. Diet estimates of 569 SB polar bears from 2004 to 2012 showed high seasonal fluctuations in the proportions of prey consumed. Higher proportions of bowhead whale, as well as ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), were estimated to occur in the winter-spring diet, while higher proportions of bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) were estimated for summer-fall diets. Trends in the annual mean proportions of individual prey items were not found in either period, except for significant declines in the proportion of beluga in spring-sampled bears. Nonetheless, in years following a high winter Arctic oscillation index, proportions of ice-associated ringed seal were lower in the winter- spring diets of adult females and juveniles. Proportions of bowhead increased in the winter-spring diets of adult males with the number of ice-free days over the continental shelf. In one or both seasons, polar bears that were in better condition were estimated to have consumed less ringed seal and/or more bowhead whale than those in worse condition. Therefore, climate variation over this recent period appeared to influence the extent of onshore vs. on-ice food use, which in turn, appeared to be linked to fluctuating condition of SB polar bears. © 2017 McKinney et al.","Arctic oscillation; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Body condition; Climate change; Diet; Polar bear; Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis; Scavenging; Sea ice; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,,"Aars, J., Andersen, M., Breniere, A., Blanc, S., White-beaked dolphins trapped in the ice and eaten by polar bears (2015) Polar Biology, 34, p. 26612; Amstrup, S.C., Polar bear, Ursus maritimus (2003) Wild mammals of North America, pp. 587-610. , in G.

This study examines how these systems may have adapted in marine aquatic environments inhabited by cetaceans. Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are ideal study animals—they possess large subcutaneous adipose stores (blubber) and undergo bi-annual migrations concurrent with variations in food availability. To answer long-standing questions regarding how (or if) energy and lipid utilization adapted to aquatic stressors, we quantified variations in gene transcripts critical to lipid metabolism related to season, age, and blubber depth. We predicted leptin tertiary structure conservation and assessed inter-specific variations in Lep transcript numbers between bowheads and other mammals. Our study is the first to identify seasonal and age-related variations in Lep and lipolysis in these cetaceans. While Lep transcripts and protein oscillate with season in adult bowheads reminiscent of hibernating mammals, transcript levels reach up to 10 times higher in bowheads than any other mammal. Data from immature bowheads are consistent with the hypothesis that short baleen inhibits efficient feeding. Lipolysis transcripts also indicate young Fall bowheads and those sampled during Spring months limit energy utilization. These novel data from rarely examined species expand the existing knowledge and offer unique insight into how the regulation of Lep and lipolysis has adapted to permit seasonal deposition and maintain vital blubber stores. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Blubber; Bowhead whale; Development; Leptin; Metabolic activity","leptin; leptin receptor; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; aging; amino acid sequence; animal; beluga whale; bowhead whale; C57BL mouse; female; genetics; human; lipid metabolism; Long Evans rat; male; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; physiology; season; thermoregulation; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Beluga Whale; Body Temperature Regulation; Bowhead Whale; Female; Humans; Leptin; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats, Long-Evans; Receptors, Leptin; Seasons",,"triacylglycerol lipase, 9001-62-1; Leptin; Lipase; Receptors, Leptin",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 34284, DK079282-01A1

Whale lens lipid phase transitions were compared with the phase transitions of other species that were recalculated. The major phospholipids of the whale lens were sphingolipids, mostly dihydrosphingo-myelins with an average molar cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of 10. There was a linear correlation between the percentage of lens sphingolipid and lens lipid hydrocarbon chain order until about 60% sphingolipid. The percentage of lens sphingolipid correlated with the lens lipid phase transition temperature. The lifespan of the bowhead whale was the longest of the species measured and the percentage of whale lens sphingolipid fit well in the correlation between the percentage of lens sphingolipid and lifespan for many species. In conclusion, bowhead whale lens membranes have a high sphingolipid content that confers resistance to oxidation, allowing these lenses to stay clear relatively longer than many other species. The strong correlation between sphingolipid and lifespan may form a basis for future studies, which are needed because correlations do not infer cause. One could hope that if human lenses could be made to have a lipid composition similar to whales, like the bowhead, humans would not develop age-related cataracts for over 100 years.—Borchman, D., R.

This study explored the distribution and abundance of the 3 Arctic resident whale species: narwhals, bowhead and white whales, in the marginal ice zone and into the sea ice north of the Svalbard Archipelago. Line-transect surveys were conducted using a combination of helicopter-based and ship-based efforts in August 2015. Twenty-six sightings, involving 27 bowhead whales and 58 narwhals, occurred along the helicopter transects, while no whales were recorded along ship transects. No white whales were observed during these surveys. After correcting for surface availability, distance sampling produced abundance estimates of 343 (CV = 0.488) bowhead whales and 837 (CV = 0.501) narwhals within the 52 919 km2 study area. Bowhead whales were predominantly seen close to the ice-edge, whereas narwhals were located deeper into the ice. To contextualize these results within the broader Svalbard cetacean community, all whale sightings from the Norwegian Polar Institute's Svalbard Marine Mammal Sighting Data Base, from the period of the survey, were mapped to compare general distributions. These opportunistic sightings included numerous cetacean species, especially seasonally occurring ones. However, white whales dominated in terms of the numbers of individuals reported. Our results suggest little spatial overlap between seasonally occurring whales and the 3 Arctic resident whales. Bowhead whales and narwhals were tightly associated with sea ice, and white whales were tightly coastal. In contrast, the seasonally occurring species were found over the shelf and along its edges. © Outside the USA the US Government 2017.","Abundance; Arctic; Belugas; Bowhead whales; Climate change; Distribution; Narwhals; Svalbard; White whales","abundance; airborne survey; climate change; community structure; sea ice; seasonality; shipborne measurement; spatial distribution; summer; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Norway; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Monodon",,,,,,,"Aars, J., Marques, T.A., Buckland, S.T., Andersen, M., Belikov, S., Boltunov, A., Wiig, Ø., Estimating the Barents Sea polar bear subpopulation size (2009) Mar Mamm Sci, 25, pp. 35-52; Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic, 1611-1911: population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environ Hist, 12, pp. 89-113; Bailleul, F., Vacquie-Garcia, J., Guinet, C., Dissolved oxygen sensor in animal-borne instruments: an innovation for monitoring the health of oceans and investigating the functioning of marine ecosystems (2015) PLOS ONE, 10; Barber, D.G., Iacozza, J., Historical analysis of sea ice conditions in M'Clintock Channel and the Gulf of Boo-thia, Nunavut: implications for ringed seal and polar bear habitat (2004) Arctic, 57, pp. 1-14; Boertmann, D., Kyhn, L.A., Witting, L., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., A hidden getaway for bowhead whales in the Greenland Sea (2015) Polar Biol, 38, pp. 1315-1319; Boily, P., Theoretical heat flux in water and habitat selection of phocid seals and beluga whales during annual moult (1995) J Theor Biol, 172, pp. 235-244; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Dahl, T.M., Lydersen, C., Kovacs, K.M., Falk-Petersen, S., Sargent, J., Gjertz, I., Gulliksen, B., Fatty acid composition of the blubber in white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (2000) Polar Biol, 23, pp. 401-409; Ferguson, S.H., Dueck, L., Loseto, L.L., Luque, S.P., Bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus seasonal selection of sea ice (2010) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 411, pp. 285-297; Ferguson, S.H., Loseto, L.L., Mallory, M.L., (2010) A little less Arctic.

Aerial surveys were conducted from late August to mid-September during the period 2007-11 for a total of 171.1 hours flown. In addition to the focal species, observed species included gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus; one humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas; ringed seals, Phoca hispida; bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus; walrus, Odobenus rosmarus; and polar bears, Ursus maritimus. Small pinnipeds, such as ringed seal and spotted seals, Phoca largha, were often difficult to differentiate and identify to species given the relatively high survey altitude of 310 m (1,000 ft). Habitat partitioning was evident among the cetacean species observed in greatest numbers: bowhead, gray, and beluga whales. Abundance estimates during this time period ranged from 22 (CV 0.80) to 213 (CV 0.30) bowhead whales, 1 (CV 1.01) to 18 (CV 0.28) gray whales, and 0 to 948 (CV 0.66) beluga whales. Standard deviation ellipses showed each species occupied a unique region within the study area with slight overlaps occurring in some years. Bowhead distribution was oriented along the barrier islands and 20 m isobath on the continental shelf and also included parts of the Barrow Canyon and shelf break that were close to shore. Gray whale distribution oriented along the Barrow Canyon shelf break near the 50 m isobath; while beluga distribution ellipses centered over Barrow Canyon and offshore slope waters. A four-parameter presence-absence model (bathymetry, bathymetric slope, distance from shore, and distance from the shelf break) found both distance from shore and shelf break were significant in predicting the presence of bowhead whales. All four parameters were significant in predicting gray whale presence. Only bathymetry was significant in predicting beluga whale presence. During the 5-year study, 664 unique bowhead whales were identified from 1,415 photographic images. Observers noted feeding behavior during 7-50% of sightings and 15-49% of photographed whales exhibited feeding behavior in any given year. Of the individual whales that were visually or photographically identified as feeding, 81-90% were in shelf waters, and the majority of those were clustered around the 20 m isobath. More feeding behavior was observed and photographed during years when most sightings occurred on the shelf (2007, 2009, and 2010) but not necessarily in years when bowheads were most abundant in the study area (e.g., 2008 and 2010). The lowest percent feeding both visually and photographically occurred in 2008, the only year whale swim direction was predominately westerly, and open mouth (skim) feeding behavior was not observed. Although the paucity of individual resightings (based on photographic recaptures) between survey days (3 matches out of 664 identified whales) suggested very low residence times, the photogrammetric sample (654 whales) was largely comprised of juveniles (65%). Young whales typically are unmarked and, therefore, not matched (only 3-6% were highly or moderately marked in at least one zone on the body). All intrayear matched whales moved east of their original sighting location, which was not expected so close to the westbound fall migration. The BOWFEST aerial study provides a 5-year record of late summer presence of cetaceans in the western Beaufort Sea, adding to the growing body of knowledge on these species and their habitat preferences in this region. This information is particularly important since the western Beaufort Sea is undergoing rapid change as the bowhead whale population continues to grow, other species extend their ranges and increase their numbers in the area, and industrial activity, commercial fishing, and shipping operations are expected to increase in the Arctic as sea ice decreases.",,"abundance estimation; aerial survey; continental shelf; feeding behavior; habitat selection; habitat use; migratory behavior; sea ice; shelf break; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; swath bathymetry; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus; Phoca hispida; Phoca largha; Pinnipedia; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y.H., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63, pp. 179-194; Braham, H.W., Dahlheim, M.E., Killer whales in Alaska documented in the platforms of opportunity program (1982) Rep.

However, this record is mostly Pliocene and younger, with most of the Miocene history of the clade remaining practically unknown. The earliest recognized balaenid is the early Miocene Morenocetus parvus Cabrera, 1926 from Argentina. M. parvus was originally briefly described from two incomplete crania, a mandible and some cervical vertebrae collected from the lower Miocene Gaiman Formation of Patagonia. Since then it has not been revised, thus remaining a frequently cited yet enigmatic fossil cetacean with great potential for shedding light on the early history of crown Mysticeti. Here we provide a detailed morphological description of this taxon and revisit its phylogenetic position. The phylogenetic analysis recovered the middle Miocene Peripolocetus as the earliest diverging balaenid, and Morenocetus as the sister taxon of all other balaenids. The analysis of cranial and periotic morphology of Morenocetus suggest that some of the specialized morphological traits of modern balaenids were acquired by the early Miocene and have remained essentially unchanged up to the present. Throughout balaenid evolution, morphological changes in skull arching and ventral displacement of the orbits appear to be coupled and functionally linked to mitigating a reduction of the field of vision. The body length ofMorenocetus and other extinct balaenids was estimated and the evolution of body size in Balaenidae was reconstructed. Optimization of body length on our phylogeny of Balaenidae suggests that the primitive condition was a relatively small body length represented by Morenocetus, and that gigantism has been acquired independently at least twice (in Balaena mysticetus and Eubalaena spp.), with the earliest occurrence of this trait in the late Miocene-early Pliocene as represented by Eubalaena shinshuensis. © 2017 Buono et al.","Balaenidae; Evolution; Mysticeti; Neogene; Patagonia","collagen; Argentina; Article; Balaenidae; baleen whale; biological trait; body height; body size; bone length; bone mass; bone maturation; cervical vertebra; Cetacea; cranial nerve; cranial suture; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; evolution; foramen magnum; gas analysis; geography; maturity; Miocene; Morenocetus parvus; nonhuman; nose cavity; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; skull; snout; temporal bone",,"collagen, 9007-34-5",,,"Society for Marine Mammalogy, SMM

In August and September, they form aggregations, which are known to occur mainly in the shallow, shelf waters when oceanographic conditions promote concentration of their zooplankton prey. The movements of individual bowheads while they occupy these late summer habitats are less well known; our knowledge is based on photographic evidence and limited tagging studies conducted from 1982 to 2000. In this study, 85% (17) of the 20 satellite-tagged whales that could have spent some time in the Canadian portion of the Beaufort Sea during late summer 2006 to 2012 spent all or part of August and September there. We analyzed location data for 16 whales, using a two-state switching correlated random walk (CRW) behavioural model, and classified locations in the Canadian waters as associated with lingering behaviour (inferred foraging) or directed travel. We found that these whales spent the greatest proportion of their time lingering (59%), followed by traveling (22%), and transitioning between lingering and traveling (19%). Using only lingering locations for these tagged whales in all study years pooled, we calculated kernel densities and defined five areas within the 75% density contour as aggregation areas. Together, the five aggregation areas we defined comprised 25 341 km2, 14.1% of the total area used by these tagged whales in Canadian waters during August and September of the deployment years. Three aggregation areas were located in shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea Shelf and were used almost exclusively by immature tagged whales in our sample. Two other aggregation areas were observed, one in Darnley Bay and one in Viscount Melville Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Each of these was used by one mature whale. Tagged whales were observed to use one or two aggregation areas in a single season, and rarely more. The proportion of lingering time spent in each aggregation area was highly variable among individuals. The largest aggregation area (10 877 km2), located over the Beaufort Shelf north of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula (5-52 m depth), was used by 13 of the 16 tagged whales, almost exclusively by the immature whales, including three of four that were tracked in two consecutive summers. The Beaufort Shelf overall (and possibly the Tuktoyaktuk Shelf, including the Outer Shelf, in particular) was especially important for immature bowhead whales, while mature whales used habitats beyond the Beaufort Shelf during late summer. Findings may be important to inform both decisions on management and mitigative actions relating to bowhead whale use of the Beaufort Shelf and studies that aim to improve our understanding of the prey base of BCB bowhead whales in the Canadian Beaufort Sea region. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aggregation areas; Amundsen Gulf; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Darnley Bay; Inferred foraging; Satellite-linked telemetry; Viscount Melville Sound","aggregation behavior; foraging behavior; habitat structure; photography; prey availability; seasonality; tagging; whale; Amundsen Gulf; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Beaufort Shelf; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Chukchi Sea; Chukchi Shelf; Darnley Bay; Northwest Territories; Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"Fisheries Joint Management Committee, FJMC

Cyamids were present on 20% of the 673 whales that were examined for cyamid ectoparasites. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with cyamid prevalence. The probability of cyamid presence increased with age, length, and improving body condition, but decreased over the past 35 years. Cyamid presence was also more probable on whales harvested in the spring than on those harvested in the fall. When present, cyamid abundance was typically low(< 10 per whale). Case histories provide ancillary information about the relationships between abundance of cyamids and their bowhead hosts. Environmental change and increasing anthropogenic disturbances are expected to occur in the Arctic regions inhabited by bowheads. We recommend continued monitoring of subsistence harvested whales for cyamids, as well as further investigations into the roles of environmental and anthropogenic variables in cyamid prevalence and abundance, as part of a comprehensive program of Arctic ecosystem assessment. © 2016, The Arctic Institute of North America.","Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Bering sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi sea; Cyamid; Cyamus ceti; Ectoparasite; Whale lice","abundance; anthropogenic effect; body condition; crustacean; ectoparasite; environmental assessment; environmental change; host-parasite interaction; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Caprellidea; Cetacea; Cyamida; Cyamus ceti",,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Social organization in sperm whales, Physeter microcephalus (1979) Behavior of Marine Animals: Current Perspectives in Research, 3, pp. 227-289. , Winn, H.E., and Olla, B.L., eds., Cetaceans.

Wind patterns during the 4 year study period are different from the long-term climatological conditions that the springtime peak in easterly winds shifted from May to June and the autumn peak was limited to October instead of extending farther into the fall. These changes were primarily due to the behavior of the two regional atmospheric centers of action, the Aleutian Low and Beaufort High. The volume transport of the shelfbreak jet, which peaks in the summer, was decomposed into a background (weak wind) component and a wind-driven component. The wind-driven component is correlated to the Pt. Barrow, AK alongcoast wind speed record although a more accurate prediction is obtained when considering the ice thickness at the mooring site. An upwelling index reveals that wind-driven upwelling is enhanced in June and October when storms are stronger and longer-lasting. The seasonal variation of Arctic cetacean occurrence is dominated by the eastward migration in spring, dictated by pack-ice patterns, and westward migration in fall, coincident with the autumn peak in shelfbreak upwelling intensity. © 2016.

Bowhead whales use the eastern Chukchi Sea primarily for migrating between the Beaufort Sea and the Bering Sea, while gray whales use the area to feed on locally abundant benthic amphipods and other prey. Bowhead whales were observed during all survey months and were distributed up to 300 km offshore west and southwest of Point Barrow, Alaska, but without a defined migratory corridor in either summer (July-August) or fall (September-October). Bowhead whale sighting rates (whales per km on effort) were highest in the shelf/trough (51 – 200 m North) depth zone in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in both summer and fall. This pattern was reflected in habitat selection ratios, which found bowhead whales in summer and fall selecting primarily shelf/trough habitat in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, with shelf habitat (36 – 50 m) being preferred secondarily. Gray whales were observed in all survey months and were distributed primarily within ~95 km of shore between Point Barrow and Icy Cape in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, and about 60 – 115 km southwest of Point Hope in the southern Chukchi Sea. In both summer and fall, gray whale sighting rates and habitat selection ratios were highest in the shelf/trough (51 – 200 m South) depth zone in the southern Chukchi Sea. In the northeastern part of the study area, gray whale sighting rates and habitat selection ratios both identified coastal habitat (≤ 35 m) as preferred habitat in summer and shelf/trough (51 – 200 m North) as preferred habitat in fall. Distribution and habitat associations of bowhead and gray whales remained similar over the 34-year time span with one exception: gray whale preference for shelf/trough habitat in the southern Chukchi Sea is now evident throughout summer and fall, whereas three decades ago gray whale preference for that area was limited to fall only. © 2016, The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aerial survey; Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Chukchi sea; Eschrichtius robustus; Feeding; Gray whale; Habitat","aerial survey; amphipod; comparative study; feeding behavior; habitat selection; line transect; marine mammal; migration route; migratory behavior; population distribution; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Point Barrow; Point Hope; United States; Amphipoda; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Aerts, L.A.M., McFarland, A.E., Watts, B.H., Lomac-Macnair, K.S., Seiser, P.E., Wisdom, S.S., Kirk, A.V., Schudel, C.A., Marine mammal distribution and abundance in an offshore sub-region of the northeastern Chukchi Sea during the open-water season (2013) Continental Shelf Research, 67, pp. 116-126. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2013.04.020; Arrigo, K.R., Van Dijken, G.L., Continued increases in Arctic Ocean primary production (2015) Progress in Oceanography, 136, pp. 60-70. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2015.05.002; Arrigo, K.R., Van Dijken, G., Pabi, S., Impact of a shrinking Arctic ice cover on marine primary production (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GL035028; Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63 (2), pp. 179-194. , http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic973; Azzara, A.J., Wang, H., Rutherford, D., (2015) A 10-Year Projection of Maritime Activity in the U.S. Arctic Region, p. 73. , Washington, D.C.: The International Council on Clean Transportation; Berline, L., Spitz, Y.H., Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Euphausiid transport in the western Arctic Ocean (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 360, pp. 163-178. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07387; Bluhm, B.A., Gradinger, R., Regional variability in food availability for Arctic marine mammals (2008) Ecological Applications, 18, pp. S77-S96. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0562.1; Bluhm, B.A., Coyle, K.O., Konar, B., Highsmith, R., High gray whale relative abundances associated with an oceanographic front in the south-central Chukchi Sea (2007) Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 54 (23-26), pp. 2919-2933. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.08.015; Bockstoce, J.R., Burns, J.J., Commercial whaling in the North Pacific sector.

On average baleen is 32.35% water by weight in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 34.37% in bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). Baleen’s wettability measured by water droplet contact angles shows that dried baleen is hydrophobic whereas hydrated baleen is highly hydrophilic. Three-point flexural bending tests of mechanical strength reveal that baleen is strong yet ductile. Dried baleen is brittle and shatters at about 20-30 Nmm− 2 but hydrated baleen is less stiff; it bends with little force and absorbed water is squeezed outwhen force is applied. Maximum recorded stress was 4× higher in dried (mean 14.29 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 3.69 N mm− 2) baleen, and the flexural stiffness was &gt;10× higher in dried (mean 633 Nmm− 2) versus hydrated (mean 58 N mm− 2) baleen. In addition to documenting hydration’s powerful effects on baleen, this study indicates that baleen is far more pliant and malleable than commonly supposed, with implications for studies of baleen’s structure and function as well as its susceptibility to oil or other hydrophobic pollutants. © 2016 The Authors.","Biomechanics; Histology; Hydrophilic; Mysticete; Stiffness; Whale",,,,,,,,"Fitzgerald, E.M.G., A bizarre new toothed mysticete (Cetacea) from Australia and the early evolution of baleen whales (2006) Proc.

The recent discovery of rod monochromacy in some cetacean lineages provides a novel opportunity to investigate the effects of an evolutionary loss of cone photoreception on retinal organization. Sequence analysis of right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; family Balaenidae) cDNA derived from long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone opsin mRNA identified several mutations in the opsin coding sequence, suggesting the loss of cone cell function, but maintenance of non-photosensitive, cone opsin mRNA-expressing cells in the retina. Subsequently, we investigated the retina of the closely related bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus; family Balaenidae) to determine how the loss of cone-mediated photoreception affects light signaling pathways in the retina. Anti-opsin immunofluorescence demonstrated the total loss of cone opsin expression in B. mysticetus, whereas light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and bipolar cell (protein kinase C-α [PKC-α] and recoverin) immunofluorescence revealed the maintenance of cone soma, putative cone pedicles, and both rod and cone bipolar cell types. These findings represent the first immunological and anatomical evidence of a naturally occurring rod-monochromatic mammalian retina, and suggest that despite the loss of cone-mediated photoreception, the associated cone signaling structures (i.e., cone synapses and cone bipolar cells) may be maintained for multichannel rod-based signaling in balaenid whales.

This alteration has resulted in an opening of habitat for subarctic species of baleen whales, many of which are recovering in number from severe depletions from commercial whaling in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specifically, humpback, fin and minke whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, Balaenoptera physalus and Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are now regularly reported during summer and autumn in the southern Chukchi Sea. These predators of zooplankton and forage fishes join the seasonally resident grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and the arctic-endemic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in the expanding open-ocean habitat of the Pacific Arctic. Questions arising include: (i) what changes in whale-prey production and delivery mechanisms have accompanied the loss of sea ice, and (ii) how are these five baleen whale species partitioning the expanding ice-free habitat? While there has been no programme of research specifically focused on these questions, an examination of seasonal occurrence, foraging plasticity and (for bowhead whales) body condition suggests that the current state of Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem may be 'boom times' for baleen whales. These favourable conditions may be moderated, however, by future shifts in ecosystem structure and/or negative impacts to cetaceans related to increased commercial activities in the region. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut, Canada, the size of the polar bear subpopulation has remained largely stable over the past 20 years, despite concurrent declines in sea ice habitat. We used fatty acid analysis to examine polar bear feeding habits in Foxe Basin and thus potentially identify ecological factors contributing to population stability. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 103 polar bears harvested during 2010–2012. Polar bear diet composition varied spatially within the region with ringed seal (Pusa hispida) comprising the primary prey in northern and southern Foxe Basin, whereas polar bears in Hudson Strait consumed equal proportions of ringed seal and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus). Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) consumption was highest in northern Foxe Basin, a trend driven by the ability of adult male bears to capture large-bodied prey. Importantly, bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) contributed to polar bear diets in all areas and all age and sex classes. Bowhead carcasses resulting from killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation and subsistence harvest potentially provide an important supplementary food source for polar bears during the ice-free period. Our results suggest that the increasing abundance of killer whales and bowhead whales in the region could be indirectly contributing to improved polar bear foraging success despite declining sea ice habitat. However, this indirect interaction between top predators may be temporary if continued sea ice declines eventually severely limit on-ice feeding opportunities for polar bears. © 2016 The Authors.

MSE can be used to identify a 'best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current 'best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae). © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Fisheries management; Management procedure; Management strategy evaluation; Simulation; Stakeholders; Uncertainty","best management practice; decision making; fishery management; guideline; numerical model; stakeholder; subpopulation; uncertainty analysis; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Clupeidae; Sardinops sagax",,,,,,,"A'mar, Z.T., Punt, A.E., Dorn, M.W., The management strategy evaluation approach and the fishery for walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska (2008) Resiliency of Gadid Stocks to Fishing and Climate Change, pp. 317-346. , In: (eds G.H.

Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) live in the Arctic where the annual cycle of increasing and decreasing ice cover affects their habitat, prey, and migration. During the nursing period, bowheads grow rapidly; but between weaning and approximately year 5, bowhead whales display sustained baleen and head growth while limiting growth in the rest of their bodies. During this period, they withdraw resources from the skeleton, in particular the ribs, which may lose 40% of bone mass. Such dramatic changes in bones of immature mammals are rare, although fossil cetaceans between 40 and 50 million years ago show an array of rib specializations that include bone loss and are usually interpreted as related to buoyancy control. © 2016 George et al.

Using the presence of ovarian corpora to define sexual maturity, 23 sexually immature whales (7.6-14.2 m total body length) and 27 sexually mature whales (14.2-17.7 m total body length) were identified. Ovary pair weights ranged from 0.38 to 2.45 kg and 2.92 to 12.02 kg for sexually immature and sexually mature whales, respectively. In sexually mature whales, corpora lutea (CLs) and/or large corpora albicantia (CAs) projected beyond ovary surfaces. CAs became increasingly less interruptive of the surface contour as they regressed, while remaining identifiable within transverse sections of the ovarian cortex. CLs formed large globular bodies, often with a central lumen, featuring golden parenchymas enfolded within radiating fibrous cords. CAs, sometimes vesicular, featured a dense fibrous core with outward fibrous projections through the former luteal tissue. CLs (never more than one per ovary pair) ranged from 6.7 to 15.0 cm in diameter in 13 whales. Fetuses were confirmed in nine of the 13 whales, with the associated CLs ranging from 8.3 to 15.0 cm in diameter. CLs from four whales where a fetus was not detected ranged from 6.7 to 10.6 cm in diameter. CA totals ranged from 0 to 22 for any single ovary, and from 1 to 41 for an ovary pair. CAs measured from 0.3 to 6.3 cm in diameter, and smaller corpora were more numerous, suggesting an accumulating record of ovulation. Neither the left nor the right ovary dominated in the production of corpora. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Cetacea; Fetus; Ovary morphology","Alaska; Article; bowhead whale; corpora albicantia; corpus luteum; female; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; ovary; ovulation; priority journal; sexual maturity; anatomy and histology; animal; bowhead whale; corpus luteum; ovary; physiology; sexual maturation; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Corpus Luteum; Female; Ovary; Sexual Maturation",,,,,,,"Albert, T.F., Scientific Research Activities Concerning the Collection and Distribution of Marine Mammal Specimen Materials under Authority of Permit #345 issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service (1985), p. 56. , Report to the National Marine Fisheries Service from the Department of Conservation and Environmental Protection.

Historically, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the SB have mostly remained on the sea ice year-round (except for those that came ashore to den), but recent changes in the extent and phenology of sea ice habitat have coincided with evidence that use of terrestrial habitat is increasing. We characterized the spatial behavior of polar bears spending summer and fall on land along Alaska's north coast to better understand the nexus between rapid environmental change and increased use of terrestrial habitat. We found that the percentage of radiocollared adult females from the SB subpopulation coming ashore has tripled over 15 years. Moreover, we detected trends of earlier arrival on shore, increased length of stay, and later departure back to sea ice, all of which were related to declines in the availability of sea ice habitat over the continental shelf and changes to sea ice phenology. Since the late 1990s, the mean duration of the openwater season in the SB increased by 36 days, and the mean length of stay on shore increased by 31 days. While on shore, the distribution of polar bears was influenced by the availability of scavenge subsidies in the form of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) remains aggregated at sites along the coast. The declining spatiotemporal availability of sea ice habitat and increased availability of human-provisioned resources are likely to result in increased use of land. Increased residency on land is cause for concern given that, while there, bears may be exposed to a greater array of risk factors including those associated with increased human activities. © 2016, Public Library of Science.

Such surveys also provide data used to estimate numbers of animals exposed to different received levels of seismic sound, as required by regulators. However, estimates of abundance are often biased because they fail to account for the effects of seismic operations on the surfacing and diving behavior of whales. Our objective was to determine the extent to which analyses of the distribution of bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus are affected by changes in visual 'availability' caused by seismic operations. We used aerial survey data collected during seismic operations in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea from late August to early October 2008 and fit spatial density surface models to bowhead sighting data to predict whale density in an ensonified area. We also incorporated availability correction factors to determine the sensitivity of density estimates to changes in surfacing and diving behavior caused by seismic operations. The influence of altered whale behavior was then evaluated by comparing a series of realistic simulated scenarios in which models incorporated undisturbed or seismic disturbance-related correction factors. Results suggest that the numbers of bowhead whales present in the vicinity of seismic operations during the bowhead autumn migration are underestimated if the behavioral effects of seismic operations on whales are ignored. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for changes in whale behavior that can affect sightability when estimating numbers and distribution of whales in the vicinity of industrial activity. © 2016 SAMS.","Alaska; Availability; Beaufort Sea; Behavior; Bowhead whale; Distance sampling; g(0); Generalized additive model; Seismic survey; Spatial models","abundance estimation; aerial survey; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; diving behavior; human activity; migration; numerical model; population density; population distribution; resource availability; sampling; seismic survey; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Bisson, L.N., Reider, H.J., Patterson, H.M., Austin, M., Brandon, J.R., Thomas, T.A., Bourdon, M.L., (2013) Marine Mammal Monitoring and Mitigation during Explortory Drilling by Shell in the Alaskan Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, July-November 2012: Draft 90-day Report, , www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/permits/shell_90dayreport_draft2012.pdf, Funk DW, Reiser CM, Koski WR (eds) LGL Rep.

The existence of a feeding aggregation of this whale species in the southwesternmost portion (apex) of Ulban Bay has been confirmed. There, the animals feed in shallow waters with depths of 3–5 m, which are only slightly larger than their body height. The quantitative composition and species structure of zooplankton at the stations that were set near feeding whales have been analyzed. In the samples taken in the immediate proximity to the feeding whales, the abundance of zooplankton reached 31409 ind./m3, with the average value of 17565 ind./m3. The lowest abundance, from 56 to 1879 ind./m3 (mean 927 ind./m3), was in the samples from western Konstantin Bay, where bowhead whales were not observed. In 16 samples collected in the immediate proximity to the feeding whales in the shallow waters of Ulban Bay, the average zooplankton biomass was 547.9 mg/m3, which is 3.9 times higher than that in the samples from waters where the whales were absent. Copepods dominated quantitatively at all the stations in Akademiya Bay. The proportion of euphausiids in the zooplankton biomass was lower than 1%, both near the feeding whales and in the absence of whales. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Akademiya Bay; bowhead whale; Sea of Okhotsk; zooplankton","abundance; body size; community composition; crustacean; feeding behavior; geographical distribution; shallow water; species richness; whale; zooplankton; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Euphausiidae",,,,,,,"Berzin, A.A., Vladimirov, V.L., The results of airbased surveys for the study of distribution and abundance of cetaceans in coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk in 1986–1987 (1988) Nauchno-issledovatel’skie raboty po morskim mlekopitayushchim severnoi chasti Tikhogo okeana v 1986–1987, pp. 18-24. , Vses.

Many populations remain at low numbers from historical commercial whaling, which had ceased for all but a few by 1989. Fishing gear entanglement and ship strikes are the most severe current threats. The acute and long-term effects of anthropogenic noise and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors are of concern but poorly understood. The looming consequences of climate change and ocean acidification remain difficult to characterize. North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the species listed as Endangered. Southern right, bowhead, and gray whales have been assessed as Least Concern but some subpopulations of these species - western North Pacific gray whales, Chile-Peru right whales, and Svalbard/Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk bowhead whales - remain at low levels and are either Endangered or Critically Endangered. Eastern North Pacific blue whales have reportedly recovered, but Antarctic blue whales remain at about 1% of pre-exploitation levels.

Flow tank experiments on bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) baleen indicate the long-standing model of dead-end filtration, at least in balaenid (bowhead and right) whales, is not merely simplistic but wrong. To recreate continuous intraoral flow, sections of baleen were tested in a flume through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were analyzed to investigate movement and capture of particles by baleen plates and fringes. Results indicate that very few particles flow directly through the baleen rack; instead much water flows anteroposteriorly along the interior (lingual) side of the rack, allowing items to be carried posteriorly and accumulate at the posterior of the mouth where they might readily be swallowed. Since water flows mainly parallel to rather than directly through the filter, the cross-flow mechanism significantly reduces entrapment and tangling of minute items in baleen fringes, obviating the need to clean the filter. The absence of copepods or other prey found trapped in the baleen of necropsied right and bowhead whales supports this hypothesis. Reduced through-baleen flow was observed with and without boundaries modeling the tongue and lips, indicating that baleen itself is the main if not sole agent of crossflow. Preliminary investigation of baleen from balaenopterid whales that use intermittent filter feeding suggests that although the biomechanics and hydrodynamics of oral flow differ, cross-flow filtration may occur to some degree in all mysticetes. © 2016 Werth, Potvin.

Over recent decades, there have been only a few sightings, and very few biological samples are available for molecular analyses. Hence, genetic diversity of the extant Spitsbergen stock is unknown. Here, we present mitochondrial genomes from eight skin biopsy samples that were collected in 2006 and 2010. There were three different haplotypes, two of which have not previously been detected. Six samples shared the same haplotype, indicating that they were obtained from closely related whales, or possibly the same individual.

Quantitative assessments typically consider a single source, whereas qualitative assessments may include multiple sources but rarely identify response variables. As a step toward understanding the cumulative effects of underwater sound, we assessed the aggregated sounds of multiple sources received by migrating bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus). The quantitative method models the sound field from multiple sources and simulates movement of a population through it. The qualitative method uses experts to assess the responses of individuals and populations to sound sources and identify the potential mechanisms.

However, marine mammals typically receive sounds from multiple, dynamic sources. We developed a method to aggregate modeled sounds from multiple sources and estimate the sound levels received by individuals. To illustrate the method, we modeled the sound fields of 9 sources associated with oil development and estimated the sound received over 47 d by a population of 10 000 simulated bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus on their annual migration through the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Empirical data were sufficient to parameterize simulations of the distribution of individual whales over time and their range of movement patterns. We ran 2 simulations to estimate the sound exposure history and distances traveled by bowhead whales: one in which they could change their movement paths (avert) in response to set levels of sound and one in which they could not avert. When animals could not avert, about 2% of the simulated population was exposed to root mean square (rms) sound pressure levels (SPL) ≥180 dB re 1 μPa, a level that regulators in the U.S. often associate with injury. When animals could avert from sound levels that regulators often associate with behavioral disturbance (rms SPL > 160 dB re 1 μPa), < 1% of the simulated population was exposed to levels associated with injury. Nevertheless, many simulated bowhead whales received sound levels considerably above ambient throughout their migration. Our method enables estimates of the aggregated level of sound to which populations are exposed over extensive areas and time periods. © The authors 2016.","Arctic; Cumulative effects; Harassment; Incidental take; Marine mammals; Negligible impact","anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; disturbance; migration; underwater noise; whale; Alaska; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Blackwell, S.B., Greene, J., Charles, R., Richardson, W.J., Drilling and operational sounds from an oil production island in the ice-covered Beaufort Sea (2004) J Acoust Soc Am, 116, pp. 3199-3211; Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald, T.L., Greene, C.R., Thode, A.M., Guerra, M., Macrander, A.M., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (2013) Mar Mamm Sci, 29, pp. E342-E365; Buck, J.R., Tyack, P.L., Response of gray whales to low frequency sounds (2000) J Acoust Soc Am, 107, p. 2774; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Potential use of low-frequency sounds by baleen whales for probing the environment: evidence from models and empirical measurements (2004) Echolocation in bats and dolphins, pp. 564-582. , Thomas J, Moss C, Vater M (eds) University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Hatch, L., Van Parijs, S.M., Frankel, A.S., Ponirakis, D., Acoustic masking in marine ecosystems: intuitions, analysis, and implication (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 395, pp. 201-222; Clarke, J.T., Ferguson, M.C., Aerial surveys for bowhead whales in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea: BWASP update 2000-2009 with comparisons to historical data (2010) Rep Int Whaling Comm, , SC/62/BRG14; Collins, M.D., A split-step Padé solution for the parabolic equation method (1993) J Acoust Soc Am, 93, pp. 1736-1742; Costa, D.P., Crocker, D.E., Gedamke, J., Webb, P.M., The effect of a low-frequency sound (acoustic thermometry of the ocean climate) on the diving behavior of juvenile northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris (2003) J Acoust Soc Am, 113, pp. 1155-1165; (1997) Considering cumulative effects under the National Environmental Policy Act, , Council on Environmental Quality, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC; D'Amico, A., Gisiner, R.C., Ketten, D.R., Hammock, J.A., Johnson, C., Tyack, P.L., Mead, J., Beaked whale strandings and naval exercises (2009) Aquat Mamm, 35, pp. 452-472; Davies, J.R., (1997) The impact of an offshore drilling platform on the fall migration path of bowhead whales: a GISbased assessment, , MS thesis, Western Washington University, Bellingham, WA; (2001) Final overseas environmental impact statement and environmental impact statement for Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Low Frequency Active (SURTASS LFA) Sonar, , Chief of Naval Operations, Washington, DC; Dorsey, E.M., Richardson, W.J., Würsig, B., Factors affecting surfacing respiration and dive behavior of bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus summering in the Beaufort Sea, Canada (1989) Can J Zool, 67, pp. 1801-1815; Ellison, W.T., Clark, C.W., Bishop, G.C., Potential use of surface reverberation by bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, in under-ice navigation: preliminary con-siderations (1987) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 37, pp. 329-332; Ellison, W.T., Sonntag, R.M., Clark, C.W., Comparison of measured bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, migration parameters with results from the tracking algorithm (1987) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 37, pp. 309-311; Ellison, W.T., Southall, B.L., Clark, C.W., Frankel, A.S., A new context-based approach to assessing marine mammal behavioral responses to anthropogenic sounds (2012) Conserv Biol, 26, pp. 21-28; Frankel, A.S., Ellison, W.T., Buchanan, J., Application of the Acoustic Integration Model (AIM) to predict and minimize environmental impacts (2002) IEEE Oceans, 2002, pp. 1438-1443; Funk, D.W., Ireland, D.S., Rodrigues, R., Koski, W.R., (2010) Joint Monitoring Program in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, open-water season 2006-2008, , LGL Alaska Report.

During 170 h of simultaneous MMO and AAM, 115 bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and four beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) were visually sighted by MMOs, while 59 sonar detections of bowhead whales occurred using AAM. The fisheries sonar detected 92% of the cetaceans observed within 2,000 m. Additional observations of ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were recorded both by MMOs and AAM. Comparative results indicate that a commercially available active acoustic system can consistently detect marine mammals within varying ranges dictated by water column properties. Shallow environments and strong pycnoclines currently present challenges to AAM. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","AAM; Active acoustic monitoring; Fisheries sonar; Marine mammals","bioacoustics; biomonitoring; comparative study; ice breaker; pinniped; shallow water; sonar; water column; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Mammalia; Phoca hispida",,,,,,,"Abgrall, P., Moulton, V.D., Richardson, W.J., Updated review of scientific information on impacts of seismic survey sound on marine mammals, 2004-present (2008) LGL Report SA973-1 for Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Habitat Science Branch, p. 27. , Ottawa, Canada; Asselin, N., Barber, D., Stirling, I., Ferguson, S., Richard, P., Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) habitat selection in the eastern Beaufort Sea in spring, 1975-1979 (2011) Polar Biology, 34, pp. 1973-1988; Au, W.W.L., Acoustic reflectivity of a dolphin (1996) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 99, pp. 3844-3848; Benoit-Bird, K.J., Au, W.W.L., Prey dynamics affect foraging by a pelagic predator (Stenella longirostris) over a range of spatial and temporal scales (2003) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 53, pp. 364-373; Bernasconi, M., Patel, R., Nøttestad, L., Brierley, A.S., Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) target strength measurements (2013) Marine Mammal Science, 29, pp. 371-388; Bernasconi, M., Patel, R., Nøttestad, L., Pedersen, G., Brierley, A.S., The effect of depth on the target strength of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2013) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134, pp. 4316-4322; Bernasconi, M., Nøttestad, L., Axelsen, B.E., Krakstad, J.O., Acoustic observations of dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus hunting Cape horse mackerel Trachurus capensis off Namibia (2011) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 429, pp. 209-218; Charif, R.A., Rahaman, A., Muirhead, C.A., Bowhead whale acoustic activity in the southeast Beaufort Sea during late summer, 2008-10 (2013) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134, pp. 4323-4334; Doksæter, L., Godø, O.R., Nøttestad, L., Patel, R., Ecological studies of marine mammals using a seabed-mounted echosounder (2009) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66, pp. 1029-1036; Dunn, J.L., Airborne measurements of acoustic characteristics of a sperm whale (1969) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 46, pp. 1052-1054; Erbe, C., Farmer, D.M., Zones of impact around icebreakers affecting beluga whales in the Beaufort Sea (2000) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 108, pp. 1332-1340; Foote, K.G., Optimizing copper spheres for precision calibration of hydroacoustic equipment (1982) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 71, pp. 742-747; Francois, R.E., Garrison, G.R., Sound absorption based on ocean measurements.

Tudor Road, Anchorage, AK  99503, United States","Reduction of summer sea ice extent has led some polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations to increase their use of land during the summer/autumn open-water period. While terrestrial food resources are generally not sufficient to compensate for lost hunting opportunities on the sea ice, marine mammal carcasses, where available, could help reduce the energetic cost of longer periods of land use. Subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) remains are available annually near local communities along the Alaskan portion of the Beaufort Sea coast to bears that come to shore. Relatively large numbers of polar bears and some grizzly bears (U. arctos) use these resources, creating a competitive environment among species and social classes. We documented competitive interactions among polar bears and between polar and grizzly bears for bowhead whale remains adjacent to a small community in northeastern Alaska in September 2005-2007. We observed temporal partitioning of the resource by bears, with lone adult polar bears and grizzly bears primarily feeding at night, and higher use by polar bear family groups and subadults during dawn and dusk. Interspecific interactions were less frequently aggressive than intraspecific interactions, but polar bears were more likely to be displaced from the feeding site by grizzly bears than by conspecifics. Female polar bears with cubs were more likely to display aggressive behavior than other social classes during intra- and interspecific aggressive interactions. Our results indicate that grizzly bears are socially dominant during interspecific competition with polar bears for marine mammal carcasses during autumn. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Mammalogists.

However, research effort has also been increasing confounding a firm conclusion. A systematic aerial survey for walrus (Odobaenus rosmarus), applying distance sampling methodology in part of the Northeast Water Polynya (NEW), revealed a ‘bycatch’ of several observations of bowhead whales, which resulted in an estimated abundance of 102 (95 % CI 32–329) individuals. This is the largest abundance of bowhead whales reported from the Greenland Sea since the days of whaling in the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries. The NEW was inaccessible to vessels during the whaling period because of heavy pack ice, and it is only recently that researchers have visited this area; thus only a few sightings of bowhead whales within the NEW exist prior to the survey in 2009. The NEW may nevertheless be one of the most important summering grounds for the Spitsbergen stock, and the whales may benefit from advection of calanoid copepods from the productive deep basins along the coast of Svalbard east of the NEW. This discovery provides renewed hope for the Spitsbergen stock of bowhead whales that until now has shown only inconclusive signs of recovery despite more than 100 years of protection from whaling. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Abundance; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Greenland Sea; Northeast Water Polynya; Population recovery","abundance; aerial survey; bycatch; endangered species; sampling; seventeenth century; stock assessment; whale; whaling; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Greenland Sea; Norwegian Sea; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Calanoida; Cetacea; Copepoda; Odobenidae",,,,,,,"Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic, 1611–1911: population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environ Hist, 12, pp. 89-113; Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y.H., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Inupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63, pp. 179-194; Boertmann, D., Mosbech, A., The western Greenland Sea, a strategic environmental impact assessment of hydrocarbon activities.

We used a long-term dataset collected from whales of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB) stock to estimate various body condition indices (BCI's) for individual whales that were harvested by Alaskan Eskimos. A series of offshore regions frequented by bowhead whales in summer were delineated and used to quantify interannual summertime environmental conditions including: (a) mean open water fraction, (b) duration of melt season, (c) date of continuous freeze-up, and (d) mean upwelling-favorable wind stress. Body condition was analyzed relative to these metrics for both the preceding summer feeding season and the previous three seasons combined. Our analysis indicates a significant increase in the long-term trend in an axillary girth-based body condition index (BCIG) over the study period (1989-2011). The increase in BCIG is likely associated with the trend in overall reduction of sea ice, including increased duration of open water, changes in upwelling potential (wind stress), and possibly higher primary production in the Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem favoring water-column invertebrates. We found strong significant positive correlations between BCIG and late summer open water fraction in the Beaufort Sea and smaller nearshore areas off the Mackenzie Delta and west of Banks Island. Additionally, BCIG was positively and significantly correlated with duration of melt season, later date of freeze-up in the Beaufort Sea, and upwelling-favorable winds on the Mackenzie shelf and west of Banks Island. A strong seasonal difference in BCI's was noted for subadult bowheads, presumably associated with summer feeding; however, yearlings were found to drop in BCI over at least the first summer after weaning. Our results indicate an overall increase in bowhead whale body condition and a positive correlation with summer sea ice loss over the last 2.5 decades in the Pacific Arctic. We speculate that sea ice loss has positive effects on secondary trophic production within the BCB bowhead's summer feeding region. While not part of this study, the abundance of BCB bowheads increased markedly over the same period. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Feeding; Sea ice; Stream flow; Wind stress; Balaena mysticetus; Body condition; Environmental conditions; Long-term trend; Positive correlations; Primary production; Sea ice conditions; Seasonal differences; Ice; body condition; data set; environmental conditions; long-term change; marine ecosystem; open water; sea ice; upwelling; whale; wind stress; Arctic Ocean; Banks Island; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Northwest Territories; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Invertebrata",,,,,"University of Colorado Boulder

A total of 41,698. h of acoustic data were recorded from 1 August 2009 through 4 October 2010 at 20 sites spread along a 2300. km transect from the Bering Sea to the southeast Beaufort Sea. These data represent the combined output from six research teams using four recorder types. Recorders sampled areas in which bowheads occur and in which there are natural and anthropogenic sources producing varying amounts of underwater noise. We describe and quantify the occurrence of bowheads throughout their range in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas over a 14-month period by aggregating our acoustic detections of bowhead whale sounds. We also describe the spatial-temporal variability in the bowhead acoustic environment using sound level measurements within a frequency band in which their sounds occur, by dividing a year into three, 4-month seasons (Summer-Fall 2009, August-November 2009: Winter 2009-2010, December 2009-March 2010: and Spring-Summer 2010, April-July 2010) and their home range into five zones. Statistical analyses revealed no significant relationship between acoustic occurrence, distance offshore, and water depth during Summer-Fall 2009, but there was a significant relationship during Spring-Summer 2010. A continuous period with elevated broadband sound levels lasting ca. 38. days occurred in the Bering Sea during the Winter 2009-2010 season as a result of singing bowheads, while a second period of elevated levels lasting at least 30. days occurred during the early spring-summer season as a result of singing bearded seals. The lowest noise levels occurred in the Chukchi Sea from the latter part of November into May. In late summer 2009 very faint sounds from a seismic airgun survey approximately 700. km away in the eastern Beaufort Sea were detected on Chukchi recorders. Throughout the year, but most obviously during the November into May period, clusters of intermittent, nearly synchronized, high-level events were evident on multiple recorders hundreds of miles apart. In some cases, these clusters occurred over 2-5. day periods and appear to be associated with high wind conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Acoustics; Frequency bands; Acoustic detection; Acoustic environment; Anthropogenic sources; Balaena mysticetus; Elevated level; Research teams; Spatial temporals; Underwater noise; Acoustic noise; bioacoustics; instrumentation; noise; range expansion; spatiotemporal analysis; transect; whale; wind direction; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Erignathus",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1107106",,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y.H., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and inupiat subsistence whaling near barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63, pp. 179-194; Benjamin, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling for false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Blackwell, S.B., Richardson, W.J., Greene, C.R., Streever, B., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) migration and calling behaviour in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, Autumn 2001-04: an acoustic localization study (2007) Arctic, 60, pp. 255-270; Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald, T.L., Greene, C.R., Thode, A.M., Guerra, M., Macrander, A.M., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (2013) Marine Mammal Science, 29, pp. E342-E365; Blackwell, S.B., Nations, C.S., McDonald T.L Thode, A.M., Mathias, D., Kim, K.H., Greene, C.R., Macrander, A.M., Effects of airgun sounds on bowhead whale calling rates: evidence for two behavioral thresholds (2015) PLoS ONE; Charif, R.A., Rahaman, A., Muirhead, C.A., Pitzrick, M.S., Warde, A.M., Hall, J., Pyć, C., Clark, C.W., Bowhead whale acoustic activity in the southeast Beaufort Sea during late summer 2008-2010 (2013) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134, p. 4323; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., George, J.C., Small, R.J., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Brower, H., Adams, B., Brower, L., Winter movements of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Bering Sea (2012) Arctic, 65, pp. 13-34; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., Okkonen, S.R., Druckenmiller, M.L., Maslowski, W., Clement-Kinney, J., George, J.C., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Ecological characteristics of core-use areas used by Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) bowhead whales, 2006-2012 (2015) Progress in Oceanography, 136, pp. 201-222; Clark, C.W., Johnson, J.H., The sounds of the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, during the spring migrations of 1979 and 1980 (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62 (7), pp. 1436-1441; Clark, C., Ellison, W., Beeman, K., Acoustic tracking of migrating bowhead whales (1986) Oceans', 86, pp. 341-346; Clarke, J.T., Christman, C.L., Grassia, S.L., Brower, A.A., Ferguson, M.C., Aerial surveys of endangered whales in the Beaufort Sea, fall 2009 (2013), Final Report, OCS Study BOEMRE 2010-040.

Balaena mysticetus) ranges across the seasonally ice-covered waters of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. We used locations from 54 bowhead whales, obtained by satellite telemetry between 2006 and 2012, to define areas of concentrated use, termed ""core-use areas"". We identified six primary core-use areas and describe the timing of use and physical characteristics (oceanography, sea ice, and winds) associated with these areas. In spring, most whales migrated from wintering grounds in the Bering Sea to the Cape Bathurst polynya, Canada (Area 1), and spent the most time in the vicinity of the halocline at depths <75. m, which are within the euphotic zone, where calanoid copepods ascend following winter diapause. Peak use of the polynya occurred between 7 May and 5 July; whales generally left in July, when copepods are expected to descend to deeper depths. Between 12 July and 25 September, most tagged whales were located in shallow shelf waters adjacent to the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Canada (Area 2), where wind-driven upwelling promotes the concentration of calanoid copepods. Between 22 August and 2 November, whales also congregated near Point Barrow, Alaska (Area 3), where east winds promote upwelling that moves zooplankton onto the Beaufort shelf, and subsequent relaxation of these winds promoted zooplankton aggregations. Between 27 October and 8 January, whales congregated along the northern shore of Chukotka, Russia (Area 4), where zooplankton likely concentrated along a coastal front between the southeastward-flowing Siberian Coastal Current and northward-flowing Bering Sea waters. The two remaining core-use areas occurred in the Bering Sea: Anadyr Strait (Area 5), where peak use occurred between 29 November and 20 April, and the Gulf of Anadyr (Area 6), where peak use occurred between 4 December and 1 April; both areas exhibited highly fractured sea ice. Whales near the Gulf of Anadyr spent almost half of their time at depths between 75 and 100. m, usually near the seafloor, where a subsurface front between cold Anadyr Water and warmer Bering Shelf Water presumably aggregates zooplankton. The amount of time whales spent near the seafloor in the Gulf of Anadyr, where copepods (in diapause) and, possibly, euphausiids are expected to aggregate provides strong evidence that bowhead whales are feeding in winter. The timing of bowhead spring migration corresponds with when zooplankton are expected to begin their spring ascent in April. The core-use areas we identified are also generally known from other studies to have high densities of whales and we are confident these areas represent the majority of important feeding areas during the study (2006-2012). Other feeding areas, that we did not detect, likely existed during the study and we expect core-use area boundaries to shift in response to changing hydrographic conditions. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Aggregates; Feeding; Hydrographic surveys; Sea ice; Seawater; Wind; Balaena mysticetus; Calanoid copepods; Ecological characteristics; Hydrographic conditions; Ice covered waters; Physical characteristics; Wind driven upwelling; Zooplankton aggregations; Ice; biotelemetry; coastal current; crustacean; diapause; ecological approach; hydrography; migratory behavior; satellite imagery; upwelling; whale; zooplankton; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Canada; Cape Bathurst Polynya; Chukchi; Gulf of Anadyr; Northwest Territories; Pacific Ocean; Point Barrow; Russian Federation; Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Calanoida; Cetacea; Copepoda; Euphausiidae",,,,,"Dental Foundation of Oregon, DFO

Box 156, Longyearbyen, Svalbard  9171, Norway","Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) diet may become more variable in some Arctic regions due to climate warming and altered sea ice habitat. We surveyed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope profiles of five polar bear tissues sampled from adult females in the Southern Beaufort Sea of Alaska in order to assess inter-tissue isotopic variability and to determine whether any dietary shifts are occurring in this population. We did not detect any significant shifts from historical means in population-level tissue stable isotope values. A number of sectioned hair samples, however, were significantly depleted in 15N relative to the mean. We hypothesized that lower hair δ15N values were due to the consumption of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) tissue. Telemetry data showed that polar bears with 15N-depleted hair sections were located on multiple dates near known subsistence-harvested bowhead whale bone piles and had spent 90 % of the prior year within 50 km of the shore. Bears with hair section δ15N values at or above the mean spent no time near bowhead whale bone piles and less than half of the year nearshore. An isotopic mixing model estimation of diet proportions determined that bowhead whale comprised approximately 50–70 % of fall diet for bears with lower hair δ15N values. We conclude that these results offer emergent evidence of an alternative foraging strategy within this population: ‘coastal’ bears, which remain near to shore for much of the year and use bowhead whale bone piles when they are present. In contrast, ‘pelagic’ bears follow a more typical strategy and forage widely on sea ice for seals. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alaska; Arctic; Bowhead whale; Foraging ecology; Polar bear;

These whales are hairless except for two patches of more than 300 hairs on the rostral tip of the lower lip and chin, the rostral tip of the upper lip, and a bilateral row of approximately ten hairs caudal to the blowhole. Histological data indicate that hairs in all three of these areas are vibrissae: they show an outermost connective tissue capsule, a circumferential blood sinus system surrounding the hair shaft, and dense innervation to the follicle. Morphometric data were collected on hair diameters, epidermal recess diameters, hair follicle length, and external hair lengths. The main difference between the hairs in the different regions is that blowhole hairs have larger diameters than the hairs in the chin and rostrum regions. We speculate that the hair shaft thickness patterns in bowheads reflect functional specializations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Anatomy; Cetacea; Hair; Vibrissa; Whale","Article; Balaena mysticetus; bowhead whale; connective tissue; cutaneous parameters; external hair length; hair; hair follicle; histology; innervation; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; vibrissa; anatomy and histology; animal; bowhead whale; epidermis; hair; lip; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Epidermis; Hair; Lip",,,,,,,"Berta, A., Ekdale, E.G., Zellmer, N.T., Demére, T.A., Kiele, S.S., Smallcomb, M., Eye, nose, hair, and throat: external anatomy of the head of a neonate gray whale (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Eschrichtiidae) (2015) Anat Rec, 298, pp. 648-659; Burgess, P.R., Perl, E.R., Cutaneous mechanoreceptors and nociceptors (1973) Handbook of sensory physiology, 2: somatosensory systems, pp. 29-78. , Iggo A, editor.

Here, we investigate the transition from normal calling behavior to decreased calling and identify two threshold levels of received sound from airgun pulses at which calling behavior changes. Data were collected in August-October 2007-2010, during the westward autumn migration in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Up to 40 directional acoustic recorders (DASARs) were deployed at five sites offshore of the Alaskan North Slope. Using triangulation, whale calls localized within 2 km of each DASAR were identified and tallied every 10 minutes each season, so that the detected call rate could be interpreted as the actual call production rate. Moreover, airgun pulses were identified on each DASAR, analyzed, and a cumulative sound exposure level was computed for each 10-min period each season (CSEL10-min). A Poisson regression model was used to examine the relationship between the received CSEL10-min from airguns and the number of detected bowhead calls. Calling rates increased as soon as airgun pulses were detectable, compared to calling rates in the absence of airgun pulses. After the initial increase, calling rates leveled off at a received CSEL10-min of ∼94 dB re 1 μPa2-s (the lower threshold). In contrast, once CSEL10-min exceeded ∼127 dB re 1 μPa2-s (the upper threshold), whale calling rates began decreasing, and when CSEL10-min values were above ∼160 dB re 1 μPa2-s, the whales were virtually silent. © 2015 Blackwell et al.

As part of this transition, these mammals evolved unusually thick blubber which acts as a metabolic reservoir as well as an insulator and provides buoyancy and streamlining. This study describes blubber stratification and correlates it to seasonal variation, feeding patterns, and ontogeny in an arctic-adapted mysticete, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). Bowheads are unique among mammals for possessing the largest known blubber stores. We found that adipocyte numbers in bowheads, like other mammals, do not vary with season or feeding pattern but that adipocyte size and structural fiber densities do vary with blubber depth. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..","Adipose; Blubber; Bowhead; Ontogeny; Seasonal variation","adipocyte; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; autumn; bowhead whale; cell count; cell density; cell structure; cytometry; feeding behavior; female; genetic variability; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; subcutaneous fat; adaptation; age; anatomy and histology; animal; autopsy; bowhead whale; cell size; comparative study; cytology; evolution; psychology; season; subcutaneous fat; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipocytes; Age Factors; Animals; Autopsy; Biological Evolution; Bowhead Whale; Cell Size; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Seasons; Subcutaneous Fat",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: R15DK079282",,"Ackman, R.G., Eaton, C.A., Jangaard, P.M., Lipids of the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) from north Atlantic waters (1965) Can J Biochem, 43, pp. 1513-1520; Ackman, R.G., Higley, J.H., Eaton, C.A., Sipos, J.C., Blubber fat deposition in mysticeti whales (1975) Can J Zool, 53, pp. 1332-1339; Ackman, R.G., Hingley, J.H., Eaton, C.A., Logan, V.H., Odense, P.H., Layering and tissue composition in the blubber of the northwest Atlantic sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) (1975) Can J Zool, 53, pp. 1340-1344; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Patterns of lipid content and stratification in the blubber of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1990) J Mammal, 71, pp. 544-554; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Heterogeneous distribution of organochlorine contaminants in the blubber of baleen whales: implications for sampling procedures (1991) Mar Environ Res, 31, pp. 275-286; Best, N.J., Bradshaw, C.J.A., Hindell, M.A., Nichols, P.D., Vertical stratification of fatty acids in the blubber of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina): implications for diet analysis (2003) J Comp Physiol B, 134, pp. 253-263; Bottino, N.R., Lipids of the Antarctic sei whale, Balaenoptera borealis (1978) Lipids, 13, pp. 18-23; Budge, S.M., Cooper, M.H., Iverson, S.J., Demonstration of the deposition and modification of dietary fatty acids in pinniped blubber using radiolabelled precursors (2004) Physiol Biochem Zool, 77, pp. 682-687; Budge, S.M., Springer, A.M., Iverson, S.J., Sheffield, G., Rosa, C., Blubber fatty acid composition of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus: implications for diet assessment and ecosystem monitoring (2008) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 359, pp. 40-46; Castellini, M.A., Trumble, S.J., Mau, T.L., Yochem, P.K., Stewart, B.S., Koski, M.A., Body and blubber relationships in Antarctic pack ice seals: implications for blubber depth patterns (2009) Physiol Biochem Zool, 82, pp. 113-120; Cooper, M.H., Budge, S.M., Springer, A.M., Sheffield, G., Resource partitioning by sympatric pagophilic seals in Alaska: monitoring effects of climate variation with fatty acids (2009) Polar Biol, 32, pp. 1137-1145; COSEWIC assessment and update status report on the bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus in Canada (2005), pp. viii and 51. , Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.

As part of a population abundance study, hydrophones were deployed in the Chukchi Sea off Point Barrow, (12 April to 27 May 2011) and in the Beaufort Sea (12 April to 30 June 2011). Data from these sites were analyzed for the presence of bowhead whale song. We identified 12 unique song types sung by at least 32 individuals during ~95 h of recordings off Point Barrow. Six of these songs were detected at the Beaufort MARU site as well as six additional song types that were not analyzed. These results suggest a shared song repertoire among some individuals. This report represents the greatest number of songs to date during the spring migration for this population. We attribute this greater variety to population growth over the 30 yr since acoustic monitoring began in the early 1980s. Singing during early to mid-spring is consistent with the hypothesis that song is a reproductive display, but further research is necessary to understand the exact function of this complex vocal behavior. © 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic monitoring; Balaena mysticetus; Barrow Alaska; Bowhead whale; Song","acoustic method; migratory behavior; migratory population; nearshore environment; population growth; song; vocalization; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Calambokidis, J., Baker, C.S., Humpback whale abundance in the North Pacific estimated by photographic capture-recapture with bias correction from simulation studies (2011) Marine Mammal Science, 27, pp. 793-818; (2011) Raven Pro: Interactive sound analysis software (Version 1.4) [computer software], , The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY; Braham, H., Fraker, M., Krogman, B.D., Spring migration of the Western Arctic population of bowhead whales (1980) Marine Fisheries Review, 42, pp. 36-46; Castellote, M., Clark, C.W., Lammers, M.O., Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) population identity in the western Mediterranean Sea (2011) Marine Mammal Science, 28, pp. 325-344; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L., George, J., Small, R., Heide-Jørgensen, M., Brower, H., Adams, B., Winter movements of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Bering Sea (2012), pp. 1-64. , Arctic; Clark, C.W., Clapham, P.J., Acoustic monitoring on a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding ground shows continual singing into late spring (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 1051-1057; Clark, C.W., Clark, J.M., Sound playback experiments with Southern Right Whales (Eubalaena australis) (1980) Science, 207, pp. 663-665; Clark, C.W., Gagnon, G.C., Low-frequency vocal behaviors of baleen whales in the North Atlantic: Insights from IUSS detections, locations and tracking from 1992 to 1996 (2004) Journal of Underwater Acoustics, 52, p. 3; Clark, C.W., Johnson, J.H., The sounds of the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, during the spring migrations of 1979 and 1980 (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1436-1441; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W., Beeman, K., Acoustic tracking of migrating bowhead whales (1986) Oceans, 86, pp. 341-346; Clark, C.W., Suydam, R., George, J.C., Acoustic monitoring of the bowhead spring migration off Pt.

The aerial survey covered 39,000 km2 and resulted in 58 sightings, yielding an abundance estimate of 744 whales (CV = 0.34, 95% CI: 357-1,461). The genetic method relied on determining sex, mitochondrial haplotypes and genotypes of nine microsatellite markers. Based on samples from a total of 427 individuals, with 11 recaptures from previous years in 2013, this resulted in an estimate of 1,538 whales (CV = 0.24, 95% CI: 827-2,249). While the aerial survey is considered a snapshot of the local spring aggregation in Disko Bay, the genetic approach estimates the abundance of the source of this aggregation. As the whales in Disko Bay primarily are adult females that do not visit the bay annually, the genetic method would presumably yield higher estimates. The studies indicate that an increase in abundance observed between 1998 and 2006 has leveled off. © 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaena mysticetus; Abundance; Aerial surveys; Arctic; Bowhead whale; Capture-recapture; Disko Bay; Genetics; Hidden Markov Models","Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Amos, B., Hoelzel, A.R., Long-term preservation of whale skin for DNA analysis (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 13, pp. 99-103; Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species (1993) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 10, pp. 960-970; Bérubé, M., Palsbøll, P., Identification of sex in cetaceans by multiplexing with three ZFX and ZFY specific primers (1996) Molecular Ecology, 5, pp. 283-287; Best, P.B., Increase rates in severely depleted stocks of baleen whales (1993) ICES Journal of Marine Science: Journal du Conseil, 50, pp. 169-186; Borchers, D.L., Zucchini, W., Heide Jørgensen, M.P., Cañadas, A., Langrock, R., Using hidden markov models to deal with availability bias on line transect surveys (2013) Biometrics; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling: Estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K; Calambokidis, J., Barlow, J., Abundance of blue and humpback whales in the eastern North Pacific estimated by capture-recapture and line-transect methods (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20, pp. 63-85; Chao, A., Huggins, R.M., Classical closed-population capture-recapture models (2005) Handbook of capture-recapture analysis, pp. 22-35. , S.

We compared δ18O and δD variability along the length of WABW baleen with isotopic values of zooplankton prey from different WABW habitat, with published δ13C and δ15N data, and with historical sea ice records. Zooplankton signatures varied widely (δ18O = -13‰-56‰; δD = -220‰ to -75‰), with regional separation between winter (Bering Sea) and summer (eastern Beaufort Sea) habitats of WABW observable in δD. The δ18O and δD of WABW varied significantly along the length of baleen (δ18O = 8-18‰; δD = -180 to -80‰), confirming seasonal migration and reflecting distinct regional dietary variation in isotopes. WABW migration appears to have varied concomitant with temporal sea ice concentration (SIC) changes; in years with high SIC, the difference in δD of WABW baleen between seasonal habitats was significantly greater than low SIC periods. This work shows that SIC is not only a determinant of habitat accessibility for WABW, but baleen may also be a record of historical SIC and Arctic climate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.","Arctic Ocean; Bowhead whale; Climate change; Sea ice; Stable isotopes","arctic environment; biochemical composition; diet; environmental change; hydrogen isotope; migratory species; oxygen isotope; sea ice; stable isotope; whale; zooplankton; Arctic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae",,,,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Research funding was provided by the Center for Global Change & Arctic Systems Research , NASA , the National Marine Fisheries Service/Alaska Fisheries Science Center , and UAF/School of Fisheries & Ocean Sciences .

Data on movement, horizontal velocity (ms-1), dive depth (m), and dive rate (dives h-1) were obtained from 39 bowhead whales (31 females, 6 males, and 2 of undetermined sex) instrumented with satellite-linked time-depth recorders (SLTDRs) in spring 2009 and 2010 in Disko Bay, West Greenland. Thirty-eight whales provided information on dive rates and movement, and potential foraging areas were identified on the basis of low dive rates and stationary behaviour. Nine potential foraging areas were identified: Disko Bay and adjacent region, Clyde Inlet, Isabella Bay, Broughton Island, Cumberland Sound, Frobisher Bay, Hudson Strait, southern Foxe Basin, and northern Foxe Basin. Two females returned to Disko Bay the following spring (duration of tags > 420 days). Their diving behavior indicated that all whales exhibited a large degree of flexibility in their use of potential feeding areas in Baffin Bay and adjacent waters. The variability of habitat selection may buffer against climate-induced changes in the preferred habitats of bowhead whales. © 2015 The Arctic Institute of North America.","Baffin bay; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Climate change; Foraging; Satellite telemetry; SLTDR","climate change; diving behavior; foraging behavior; habitat selection; identification method; predator-prey interaction; satellite imagery; whale; zooplankton; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Disko Bay; Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63 (2), pp. 179-194. , http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic973; Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59 (4), pp. 390-412. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2007.12.005; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4 (2014) R Package Version, 1, pp. 1-7. , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4; Bednarski, J., An early Holocene bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in Nansen Sound, Canadian Arctic Archipelago (1990) Arctic, 43 (1), pp. 50-54. , http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic1590; Carroll, G.M., George, J.C., Lowry, L.F., Coyle, K.O., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) feeding near Point Barrow, Alaska, during the 1985 spring migration (1987) Arctic, 40 (2), pp. 105-110. , http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic1754; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., Okkonen, S.R., Druckenmiller, M.L., Maslowski, W., Clement-Kinney, J., George, J.C., In press.

These animals should possess protective molecular adaptations relevant to age-related diseases, particularly cancer. Here, we report the sequencing and comparative analysis of the bowhead whale genome and two transcriptomes from different populations. Our analysis identifies genes under positive selection and bowhead-specific mutations in genes linked to cancer and aging. In addition, we identify gene gain and loss involving genes associated with DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, cancer, and aging. Our results expand our understanding of the evolution of mammalian longevity and suggest possible players involved in adaptive genetic changes conferring cancer resistance. We also found potentially relevant changes in genes related to additional processes, including thermoregulation, sensory perception, dietary adaptations, and immune response.

Behavioural data (i.e. surface and dive times) from government- and industry-funded aerial observation programmes (1980-2000) were used to calculate availability correction factors needed to estimate the number of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) from aerial survey sighting data. Correction factors were calculated for bowhead whales exposed and not exposed to seismic operations. Travelling non-calf whales were found to be less likely to be available for detection than other whales, and their availability further declined in the presence of seismic operations. Noncalves were also less available to observers during autumn when exposed to seismic operations than when not exposed, regardless of activity (travelling or otherwise). Such differences in availability appear to reflect behavioural responses to the sound of seismic operations that alters the surfacing and diving patterns of bowhead whales. Localised abundance estimated from aerial surveys may range from 3% to as much as 63% higher in areas ensonified by seismic operations if correction factors are applied to account for differences in availability associated with the presence of seismic operations, compared to abundance estimates derived from assessments that only account for changes in availability of undisturbed whales. These results provide the first empirical estimates of availability for bowhead whales exposed to seismic operations and highlight the implications of not correcting for disturbance-related availability in density assessments in the vicinity of seismic operations.","Beaufort sea; Behaviour; Bowhead whale; Diving; G(0); Line-transect; Monitoring; Noise; Survey-aerial","abundance; aerial survey; behavioral response; diving behavior; line transect; population density; seismicity; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Blackwell, S.B., Richardson, W.J., Greene, C.R., Jr., Streever, B., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) migration and calling behaviour in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, autumn 2001-04: An acoustic localization study (2007) Arctic, 60 (3), pp. 255-270; Borchers, D.L., Zucchini, W., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Cañadas, A., Langrock, R., Using hidden Markov models to deal with availability bias on line transect surveys (2013) Biometrics, 69 (3), pp. 703-713; Brandon, J.R., Thomas, T.A., Bourdon, M., (2011) Chapter 7.

Despite recent advances in knowledge of summer diet composition, determining seasonal variation in foraging behaviour of EC-WG bowhead whales remains a priority for understanding how annual metabolic requirements are met, as well as identifying factors driving seasonal habitat selection. We measured stable nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur isotope composition (δ15N, δ13C, and δ34S) along continuously growing baleen plates (n = 14) to assess alternative seasonal foraging hypotheses, namely winter fasting vs. year-round foraging. Synchronous δ15N and δ13C cycles, with periods of 15N enrichment corresponding to foraging on the summer grounds, were inconsistent with standard fasting predictions, although δ15N cycles could reflect changes in diet-tissue δ15N discrimination between periods of intense foraging throughout the open-water season and supplemental protein intake during winter/spring. Correlations between δ15N and δ34S values, potentially meditated through amino acid metabolism, support this interpretation. Reasonable agreement between baleen isotope oscillations and regional baseline δ15N and δ13C variation also indicated foraging occurs within isotopically distinct food webs across the summer and winter ranges. We conclude that EC-WG bowhead whales forage throughout their distribution, and conservatively interpret δ15N and δ34S cycles to reflect reduced food consumption during winter.

Distant visual sighting and resighting of intermittent whale surfacings is very unlike recapturing banded birds or tagged fish. We develop several bias correction strategies that are essential to confront difficulties introduced by sighting ambiguities, match uncertainty, group size inconsistencies, and the survey protocol. These are implemented using a weighted likelihood adaptation of a standard capture-recapture model. This model estimates the relationship between detection probabilities and covariates associated with the sighting. We present a complete analysis of the bowhead example and discuss how the data configuration, weighting, and estimation methods presented here highlight issues that are confronted in the analysis of many other complex capture-recapture datasets. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Independent observers; Mis-identification; Recapture uncertainty; Relevance weighting","data set; estimation method; mark-recapture method; survey; tagging; whale; Aves; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Agostinelli, C., Greco, L., A weighted strategy to handle likelihood uncertainty in Bayesian inference (2013) Computational Statistics, 28, pp. 319-339; Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Manly, B.F.J., (2010) Handbook of Capture-Recapture Analysis, , Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ; Braham, H., Krogman, B., Leatherwood, S., Marquette, W., Rugh, D., Tillman, M., Johnson, J., Carroll, G., Preliminary report of the 1978 spring bowhead whale research program results (1979) Rep.

This reduction likely occurred asa selective response to their fully aquatic lifestyle. The glomeruli that occur in theolfactory bulb can be divided into two non-overlapping domains, a dorsal domainand a ventral domain. Recent molecular studies revealed that all modern whaleshave lost olfactory receptor genes and marker genes that are specific to the dorsaldomain. Here we show that olfactory bulbs of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus)lack glomeruli on the dorsal side, consistent with the molecular data. In addition, weestimate that there are more than 4,000 glomeruli elsewhere in the bowhead whaleolfactory bulb, which is surprising given that bowhead whales possess only 80 intactolfactory receptor genes. Olfactory sensory neurons that express the same olfactoryreceptors in rodents generally project to two specific glomeruli in an olfactorybulb, implying an approximate 1:2 ratio of the number of olfactory receptors tothe number of glomeruli. Here we show that this ratio does not apply to bowheadwhales, reiterating the conceptual limits of using rodents as model organisms forunderstanding the initial coding of odor information among mammals. © 2015 Kishida et al.","Baleen whale;

Dissection of the head of a neonatal gray whale revealed novel anatomical details of the eye, blowhole, incisive papilla with associated nasopalatine ducts, sensory hairs, and throat grooves. Compared to a similar sized right whale calf, the gray whale eyeball is nearly twice as long. The nasal cartilages of the gray whale, located between the blowholes, differ from the bowhead in having accessory cartilages. A small, fleshy incisive papilla bordered by two blind nasopalatine pits near the palate's rostral tip, previously undescribed in gray whales, may be associated with the vomeronasal organ, although histological evidence is needed for definitive identification. Less well known among mysticetes are the numerous elongated, stiff sensory hairs (vibrissae) observed on the gray whale rostrum from the ventral tip to the blowhole and on the mandible. These hairs are concentrated on the chin, and those on the lower jaw are arranged in a V-shaped pattern. We confirm the presence of two primary, anteriorly converging throat grooves, confined to the throat region similar to those of ziphiid and physeteroid odontocetes. A third, shorter groove occurs lateral to the left primary groove. The throat grooves in the gray whale have been implicated in gular expansion during suction feeding.

However, skin irregularities can make suction cup attachment unreliable, and traditional pole deployment of suction cup tags is challenging in moderate sea conditions or when whales are evasive. We developed a new tag attachment to overcome these limitations. The attachment features a short (6·5-7·5 cm) needle that anchors in the whale's dermis (epidermis and blubber) to which a free-floating tag is attached via a severable tethered link. The needle, tag and a detachable 'carrier rocket' with fletching are fitted together to form a projectile that can be deployed at distances of up to 20 m using a compressed-air launcher. A corrosive release mechanism allows the tag to separate from the needle after a specified period of time so that the tag can be recovered. The dermal attachment was evaluated during a study of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Gulf of Maine and then subsequently deployed on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) near Barrow, Alaska. Monitoring of tagged humpback whales indicated that the needle was shed several days after deployment, the attachment site healed shortly thereafter, and there were no discernible behavioural or health effects over time scales of days to months after tagging. Bowhead whales showed little immediate reaction to tagging; the most common response was a prolonged dive right after tag deployment. On average, respiration rates of tagged bowhead whales were elevated after tag attachment, but returned to the same rate as undisturbed bowheads within 1-1·5 h. When compared to suction cups, the dermal anchor provided a more reliable attachment and it can be applied from greater distances and in rougher sea conditions; it is therefore a useful alternative in circumstances where suction cup tags cannot be easily deployed. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Behaviour; Bowhead whale; Foraging; Humpback whale; Mysticete; Suction cup",,,,,,,,"Andrews, R., Pitman, R., Balance, L., Satellite tracking reveals distinct movement patterns for Type B and Type C killer whales in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica (2008) Polar Biology, 31, pp. 1461-1468; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Freitag, L., Partan, J., Ball, K., Prada, K., Tracking large marine predators in three dimensions: the Real-time Acoustic Tracking System (2008) IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 33, pp. 146-157; Calambokidis, J., Schorr, G.S., Steiger, G.H., Francis, J., Bakhtiari, M., Marshall, G., Oleson, E.M., Robertson, K., Insights into the underwater diving, feeding, and calling behavior of blue whales from a suction-cup-attached video-imaging tag (Crittercam) (2007) Marine Technology Society Journal, 41, pp. 19-29; Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Reactions of humpback whales to skin biopsy sampling on a West Indies breeding ground (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 382-391; Ford, J.K.B., Durban, J.W., Ellis, G.M., Towers, J.R., Pilkington, J.F., Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Andrews, R.D., New insights into the northward migration route of gray whales between Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and southeastern Alaska (2013) Marine Mammal Science, 29, pp. 325-337; Friedlaender, A.S., Hazen, E.L., Nowacek, D.P., Halpin, P.N., Ware, C., Weinrich, M.T., Hurst, T., Wiley, D., Diel changes in humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae feeding behavior in response to sand lance Ammodytes spp. behavior and distribution (2009) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 395, pp. 91-100; Goodyear, J.D., A sonic radio tag for monitoring dive depths and underwater movements of whales (1993) Journal of Wildlife Management, 57, pp. 503-513; Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Kleivane, L., Oeien, N., Laidre, K.L., Jensen, M.V., A new technique for deploying satellite transmitters on baleen whales: tracking a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) in the North Atlantic (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 949-954; Malcolm, C.D., Duffus, D.A., Comparison of subjective and statistical methods of dive classification using data from a time-depth recorder attached to a gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) (2000) The Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2, pp. 177-182; Mate, B., Mesecar, R., Lagerquist, B., The evolution of satellite-monitored radio tags for large whales: one laboratory's experience (2007) Deep-Sea Research, Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 54, pp. 224-247; Stimpert, A.K., Wiley, D.N., Au, W.W.L., Johnson, M.P., Arsenault, R., 'Megapclicks': acoustic click trains and buzzes produced during night-time foraging of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 467-470; Watkins, W.A., A projectile point for penetrating whale blubber (1979) Deep-Sea Research, 26, pp. 1301-1308; Watkins, W.A., Reaction of three species of whales Balaenoptera physalus, Megaptera novaeangliae, and Balaenoptera edeni to implanted radio tags (1981) Deep-Sea Research, 28, pp. 589-599; Watkins, W.A., Wartzok, D., Martin, H.B., Maiefski, R.R., A radio whale tag (1980) Advanced Concepts in Ocean Measurement for Marine Biology, pp. 227-241. , (eds F.P.

Until now, Steller's sea cow was thought to be restricted in historic times to Bering and Copper Islands, Russia, with other records in the last millennium from the western Aleutian Islands. However, Steller's sea cow bone has been obtained by the authors from St Lawrence Island, Alaska, which is significantly further north. Bone identity was verified using analysis of mitochondrial DNA. The nitrogen-15 (δ15 N)/ carbon-13 (δ13 C) values for bone samples from St Lawrence Island were significantly ( p ≤ 0.05) different from Bering Island samples, indicating a second population. Bone samples were dated to between 1030 and 1150 BP (approx. 800-920 CE). The samples date from close to the beginning of the mediaeval warm period, which could indicate that the population at St Lawrence Island was driven to extinction by climate change. A warming of the climate in the area may have changed the availability of kelp; alternatively or in addition, the animals may have been driven to extinction by the expansion of the Inuit from the Bering Strait region, possibly due to opening waterways, maybe following bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), or searching for iron and copper. This study provides evidence for a previously unknown population of sea cows in the North Pacific within the past 1000 years and a second Steller's sea cow extirpation event in recent history. ©2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The use of such reconstructions has hitherto been complicated by uncertain marine reservoir corrections precluding meaningful intercomparisons with data reported in calibrated or sidereal years. Based on an exhaustive compilation of previously published marine mammal radiocarbon dates (both live-harvested materials and subfossils) from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), new, statistically-derived δ13C and δR values are provided. Average δ13C values are:-16.1±1.1‰ (bone collagen; n=193) for bowhead (Balaena mysticetus);-14.4±0.5‰ (n=44; dentine) for beluga (Delphinapterus leucas);-14.8±1.9‰ (teeth and tusks; n=18) and-18.0±4.7‰ (n=9; bone collagen) for walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). δR values are 170±95 14C years for bowhead (n=23) and 240±60 14C years for beluga (n=12). Scarce data preclude calculation of meaningful, statistically robust walrus δR. Using the new δR values, an expanded and revised database of calibrated bowhead dates (651 dates; many used in previous CAA sea-ice reconstructions) shows pronounced late Quaternary spatio-temporal fluctuations in bone abundance. Though broadly resembling earlier bowhead subfossil frequency data, analysis of the new expanded database suggests early- and mid-Holocene increases in whale abundance to be of longer duration and lower amplitude than previously considered. A more even and persistent spread of infrequent low-abundance remains during ""whale free"" intervals is also seen. The dominance of three eastern regions (Prince Regent Inlet &amp; Gulf of Boothia; Admiralty Inlet; Berlinguet Inlet/Bernier Bay) in the CAA data, collectively contributing up to 88% of all subfossil remains in the mid-Holocene, is notable. An analysis of calibrated regional sea-level index points suggests that severance of the Admiralty Inlet-Gulf of Boothia marine channel due to isostatically-driven regression may have played a significant role in enhanced whale mortality during this interval. Comparisons between the newly calibrated bowhead data and other regional sea-ice proxy data further highlight spatial and temporal discrepancies, potentially due to regional asynchronicities and variable sensitivities in proxy response to climate and oceanographic forcing. However, the limited number of deglacial-postglacial marine records continues to hamper extensive intercomparisons between marine mammal and other proxy datasets. Nevertheless, an examination of assumptions inherent in linking bowhead subfossil frequencies, population densities, and sea-ice thickness and distribution, shows that such relationships are highly complex. Factors such as broad sea-ice preferences, variable mortality rates and causes, long distance carcass transport, variable coastline and basin/channel geometries, and changing emergence rates all complicate the correlation of whale bone abundance to sea-ice histories. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Canadian Arctic; Radiocarbon calibration; Reservoir correction; Sea ice; δR","Bone; Collagen; Mammals; Population statistics; Sea ice; Sea level; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whales; Canadian Arctic; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; Delphinapterus leucas; Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction; Radiocarbon calibration; Spatio-temporal fluctuations; Repair; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus",,,,,,,"Andersen, L.W., Born, E.W., Gjertz, I., Wiig, Ø., Holm, L.-E., Bendixen, C., Population structure and gene flow of the Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) in the eastern Atlantic Arctic based on mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite variation (1998) Mol.

Global climate change is already having major impacts on Arctic ecosystems. Increasing temperatures and reductions in sea ice are particular conservation concerns for ice-associated species, including three endemic cetaceans that have evolved in or joined the Arctic sympagic community over the last 5. M years. Sea ice losses are also a major stimulant to increased industrial interest in the Arctic in previously ice-covered areas. The impacts of climate change are expected to continue and will likely intensify in coming decades. This paper summarizes information on the distribution and movement patterns of the three ice-associated cetacean species that reside year-round in the Arctic, the narwhal (Monodon monoceros), beluga (white whale, Delphinapterus leucas), and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). It maps their current distribution and identifies areas of seasonal aggregation, particularly focussing on high-density occurrences during the summer. Sites of oil and gas exploration and development and routes used for commercial shipping in the Arctic are compared with the distribution patterns of the whales, with the aim of highlighting areas of special concern for conservation. Measures that should be considered to mitigate the impacts of human activities on these Arctic whales and the aboriginal people who depend on them for subsistence include: careful planning of ship traffic lanes (re-routing if necessary) and ship speed restrictions; temporal or spatial closures of specified areas (e.g. where critical processes for whales such as calving, calf rearing, resting, or intense feeding take place) to specific types of industrial activity; strict regulation of seismic surveys and other sources of loud underwater noise; and close and sustained monitoring of whale populations in order to track their responses to environmental disturbance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Beluga; Bowhead Whale; Climate Change; Industry; Narwhal","cetacean; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; endemic species; environmental disturbance; geographical distribution; hydrocarbon exploration; ice cover; marine ecosystem; maritime transportation; movement; sea ice; Arctic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Monodon; Monodon monoceros",,,,,"Norsk Polarinstitutt

Establishing property rights for environmental goods and allowing trade between resource extractors and resource conservationists may offer a path forward in conserving charismatic species like whales, wolves, turtles, and sharks.

We also examined the intrinsic cricoarytenothyroid muscle (Musculus (M.) diverticuli laryngei) which forms the laryngeal diverticulum, to ascertain its interactions with the laryngeal cartilages during respiration and sound production. Five fetal larynges and four from adult whales were studied using noninvasive imaging, as well as macroscopic and microscopic techniques. The larynx extends from the skull base into the thoracic inlet. The dorsally curved laryngeal stalk, supported by epiglottis and the corniculate processes of arytenoid cartilages, is situated within the nasopharynx. The epiglottic cartilage exhibits a prominent medial ridge. The arytenoid cartilages are rod-shaped, and extend through the laryngeal cavity. The thyroid cartilage possesses a prominent caudal horn with a fibrous articulation to the ventrally incomplete cricoid cartilage. The M. thyroepiglotticus forms the connection between epiglottic and thyroid cartilages. The M. cricothyroideus lateralis connects the caudal horn of the thyroid cartilage with the cricoid cartilage and the M. cricothyroideus medialis connects the cricoid and thyroid cartilage. An extensive laryngeal diverticulum (Diverticulum laryngis), formed by the laryngeal mucosa and M. diverticuli laryngei, is positioned caudo-ventral to the laryngeal vestibule. The mucosa thickens into a fold medial to the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages. Experiments with airflow combined with histological and anatomical evidence strongly suggest a sound producing function for these (vocal) folds. This analysis provides the first account of sound producing structures and function in bowhead whales. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bowhead whale; Laryngeal diverticulum; Morphology; Mysticeti; Vocalization","acoustic technology; adult; anatomical variation; animal experiment; animal structures; article; bowhead whale; breathing; cricoarytenothyroid muscle; cricoid; epiglottis; female; fetus; histology; larynx; larynx cartilage; larynx mucosa; male; nasopharynx; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory airflow; skeletal muscle; skull base; sound analysis; swallowing; thoracic cavity; vocal cord; vocalization; anatomy and histology; animal; bowhead whale; larynx; physiology; trachea; vocalization; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mysticeti; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Female; Larynx; Male; Trachea; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,,"Bass, A.H., Clark, C.W., The physical acoustics of underwater sound communication (2003) Acoustic communication, pp. 15-64. , Simmons AM, Popper AN, Fay RR, editors.

The area north of Svalbard has probably been ice-covered during winter in the period from approximately 1790 until the 1980s, a period during which heavy ice conditions have prevailed in the Barents Sea and Svalbard waters. However, recent winters have been characterized by midwinter open water conditions on the shelf, concomitant with northeasterly along-shelf winds in January 2012. The resulting northward Ekman transport resulted in a strong upwelling of Atlantic Water along the shelf. We suggest that a reduction in sea ice and the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters seen in the winter of 2012 created conditions similar to those that occurred during the peak of the European whaling period (1690–1790) and that this combination of physical features was in fact the driving force behind the high primary and secondary production of diatoms and Calanus spp., which sustained the large historical stocks of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in Arctic waters near Spitsbergen. © 2014, The Author(s).","Arctic hotspot; Arctic sea ice; Arctic shelf break; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whales; Calanus spp; Climate change; Ekman transport",,,,,,,,"Abrahamsen, E.P., Østerhus, S., Gammelsrød, T., Ice draft and current measurements from the north-western Barents Sea, 1993–96 (2006) Polar Res, 25 (1), pp. 25-37; Ådlandsvik, B., Loeng, H., A study of the climatic system in the Barents Sea (1991) Polar Res, 10, pp. 45-49; Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic, 1611–1911: population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environ Hist, 12, pp. 89-113; Berge, J., Gabrielsen, T.M., Moline, M., Renaud, P.E., Evolution of the Arctic Calanus complex: an Arctic marine avocado?

The bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus is the longest-lived mammal known, with an estimated maximal lifespan in excess of two hundred years. It is also one of the two largest animals and the most coldadapted baleen whale species. Here, we report the first genome-wide gene expression analyses of the bowhead whale, based on the de novo assembly of its transcriptome. Bowhead whale or cetacean-specific changes in gene expression were identified in the liver, kidney and heart, and complemented with analyses of positively selected genes. Changes associated with altered insulin signaling and other gene expression patterns could help explain the remarkable longevity of bowhead whales as well as their adaptation to a lipid-rich diet. The data also reveal parallels in candidate longevity adaptations of the bowhead whale, naked mole rat and Brandt's bat. The bowhead whale transcriptome is a valuable resource for the study of this remarkable animal, including the evolution of longevity and its important correlates such as resistance to cancer and other diseases. © Seim et al.","Aging; Avolution; Bowhead whale; Insulin/IGF1-axis; Transcriptome","transcriptome; adaptation; animal; bowhead whale; genetics; high throughput sequencing; longevity; phylogeny; sequence analysis; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bowhead Whale; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Longevity; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: AG047200

In the winter of 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 the spatial distribution of 21 satellite tagged bowhead whales partially overlapped areas in which pot fisheries for cod and blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus) occurred. However, these fisheries ended before whales entered the fishing areas, thus avoiding temporal overlap. A fishery for snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) typically runs from January to May and provides the greatest potential for bowhead whales to encounter active pot gear. Tagged whales did not enter the area of the snow crab fishery during this study and generally remained in areas with >90% sea ice concentration, which is too concentrated for crab boats to penetrate. Pack ice sometimes overruns active fishing areas, resulting in lost gear, which is the most likely source of entanglement. The western Arctic stock of bowhead whales was increasing as of 2004; as such, incidental mortality from commercial pot fisheries is probably negligible at this time. Regardless, entanglement may increase over time and should be monitored. © 2013 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaena mysticetus; Bering Sea; Bering sea-aleutian island crab rationalization program; Bowhead whale; Commercial pot fisheries; Entanglement; Pacific cod; Pot gear","bycatch; continental shelf; crab fishery; fishing gear; gadoid fishery; mortality; risk assessment; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; stock assessment; whale; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Chaceon affinis; Chionoecetes; Chionoecetes opilio; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gadus macrocephalus; Paralithodes; Paralithodes platypus",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., De Master, D.P., Differentiating serious and non-serious injury of marine mammals taken incidental to commercial fishing operation (1998), Report of the Serious Injury Workshop, 1-2 April 1997, Silver Spring, MD.

The first bones attributed to this species were found in Sweden in 1705. When whale remains were discovered on the Swedish west coast during the extension work of a motorway extension, it was speculated that this could be a specimen of the extinct Swedenborg whale. The bones were found 72 m above the present-day sea level embedded in glacial mud. Shelly remains of marine organisms were present in the deposit surrounding the whale-fall, and sediments with the associated specimens were therefore collected for further analyses. We applied radiocarbon dating, thin sectioning, morphological analyses, ancient DNA typing and analyses of the associated shelly assemblage in an interdisciplinary effort to understand the circumstances of this fossil whale-fall. Our results show that the whale is not the putative species B. swedenborgii, but a bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus. The results also indicate that the whale must have been rapidly covered by glacial sediments, highlighting the speed of the deglacial process in the area. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Balaena mysticetus; Balaena swedenborgii; bowhead whale; cetacean taphonomy; Greenland right whale; mtDNA control region; petrographic thin section","cetacean; DNA; fossil record; paleoecology; petrography; Pleistocene; skeletal remains; taphonomy; whale; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Sweden; Balaena; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mysticeti",,,,,"Svenska ForskningsrÃ¥det Formas

Novel tools are needed for assessment of stress physiology and potential impacts of these stressors on health, reproduction and survival. We have investigated baleen as a possible novel tissue type for retrospective assessment of stress and reproductive hormones. We found that pulverized baleen powder from bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) contained immunoreactive cortisol and progesterone that were detectable with commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits. Both assays passed parallelism and accuracy validations using baleen extracts. We analysed cortisol and progesterone at the base of the baleen plate (most recently grown baleen) from 16 bowhead whales of both sexes. For a subset of 11 whales, we also analysed older baleen from 10, 20 and 30 cm distal to the base of the baleen plate. Immunoreactive cortisol and progesterone were detectable in all baleen samples tested. In base samples, females had significantly higher concentrations of cortisol and progesterone compared with males. Cortisol concentrations in older baleen (10, 20 and 30 cm locations) were significantly lower than at the base and did not exhibit correlations with age-class or sex. Progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in females than in males at all baleen locations tested and were significantly higher in pregnant females than in non-pregnant females. Four of five mature females showed dramatic variation in progesterone concentrations at different locations along the baleen plate that may be indicative of previous pregnancies or luteal phases. In contrast, all males and all immature females had uniformly low progesterone. Baleen hormone analysis is a novel approach that, with further methodological development, may be useful for determining individual longitudinal profiles of reproductive cycles and stress responses. © The Author 2014.","Baleen; Cortisol; Progesterone; Reproduction; Stress; Whales",,,,,,,,"Amaral, R.S., Use of alternative matrices to monitor steroid hormones in aquatic mammals: a review (2010) Aquat Mamm, 36, pp. 162-171; Ashley, N., Barboza, P., Macbeth, B., Janz, D., Cattet, M., Booth, R., Wasser, S., Glucocorticosteroid concentrations in feces and hair of captive caribou and reindeer following adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge (2011) Gen Comp Endocrinol, 172, pp. 382-391; Bechshøft, T., Sonne, C., Dietz, R., Born, E., Novak, M., Henchey, E., Meyer, J., Cortisol levels in hair of East Greenland polar bears (2011) Sci Total Environ, 409, p. 831; Bechshøft, TØ., Rigét, F., Sonne, C., Letcher, R., Muir, D., Novak, M., Henchey, E., Jaspers, V., Measuring environmental stress in East Greenland polar bears, 1892-1927 and 1988-2009: what does hair cortisol tell us?

Samples were collected from subsistencehunted whales (n = 86) taken from 1999 to 2009. In general, irrespective of sample matrix, pregnant females had the highest concentrations by orders of magnitude, followed by mature animals of both sexes, and subadults had the lowest concentrations. Subadult males and females had similar progesterone concentrations in all sample matrices measured. When pregnant animals were included in our analyses, permuted regression models indicated a strong positive relationship between serum and blubber progesterone levels (r2 = 0.894, p = 0.0002). When pregnant animals were not included, we found no significant relationship between serum and blubber levels (r2 = 0.025, p = 0.224). These results suggest that progesterone concentrations are mirrored in these sample types over longer periods (i.e. on the order of weeks to months, time frame of reproductive changes) but not shorter periods (i.e. on the order of hours to days, time frame of daily fluctuations). This conclusion is consistent even for progesterone concentrations measured in females that had recently changed pregnancy states (either new mothers or newly pregnant animals), for which blubber progesterone levels seem to lag those in the serum. Finally, urine progesterone had statistically significant positive relationships with serum (r2 = 0.136, p = 0.0460) and blubber pro-gesterone (r2 = 0.150, p = 0.0421). Our results suggest that progesterone concentrations first peak in the serum, then in the urine, and finally in the blubber.","Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Bering sea; Blubber; Chukchi sea; Pregnancy;

As each mode propagates with a different group speed, a call's range can be inferred by the relative time-frequency dispersion of the modal arrivals. Traditionally, at close ranges modal arrivals are separated using synchronized hydrophone arrays. Here a nonlinear signal processing method called ""warping"" is used to filter the modes on just a single hydrophone. The filtering works even at relatively short source ranges, where distinct modal arrivals are not separable in a conventional spectrogram. However, this warping technique is limited to signals with monotonically increasing or decreasing frequency modulations, a relatively common situation for bowhead calls. Once modal arrivals have been separated, the source range can be estimated using conventional modal dispersion techniques, with the original source signal structure being recovered as a by-product. Twelve bowhead whale vocalizations recorded near Kaktovik (Alaska) in 2010, with signal-to-noise ratios between 6 and 23 dB, are analyzed, and the resulting single-receiver range estimates are consistent with those obtained independently via triangulation from widely-distributed vector sensor arrays. Geoacoustic inversions for each call are necessary in order to obtain the correct ranges. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Dispersion (waves); Signal processing; Arctic environments; Balaena mysticetus; Dispersive propagation; Geoacoustic inversion; Non-linear signal processing; Normal mode theory; Vector sensor array; Warping techniques; Hydrophones; acoustics; animal; Arctic; bowhead whale; devices; motion; physiology; pressure; pressure transducer; sea; signal noise ratio; signal processing; sound; sound detection; time; vocalization; Acoustics; Animals; Arctic Regions; Bowhead Whale; Motion; Oceans and Seas; Pressure; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Sound; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Transducers, Pressure; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,,"Moore, S.E., Reeves, R.R., Distribution and movement (1993) The Bowhead Whale, pp. 313-386. , edited by J.

The confined nature of the Bering Strait forces both vessel traffic and the migrating Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales to occupy the same narrow space, thus putting individual animals at risk of vessel strike. The potential for vessel strike may become exacerbated as the reduction of Arctic sea ice makes the Arctic increasingly accessible, allowing vessels to transit through the Strait in greater densities. In drawing from lessons learned in the successful reduction of vessel strike to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), the author provides broad recommendations for implementing ships' routeing measures in the Bering Strait region based on findings by Citta et al. (2012). It is recommended that both the western side of Big Diomede Island and the western side of St. Lawrence Island be designated as seasonal Areas To Be Avoided (ATBA) during fall months when bowheads are known to inhabit the area. Alternatively, it is proposed that Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) be implemented so that vessels must keep to the eastern side of both Big Diomede Island and St. Lawrence Island during this time. Both measures would reduce the amount of overlap between migrating bowhead whales and transiting vessel traffic, effectively reducing the potential for vessel strike. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bering strait; Bowhead whale; Conservation; International maritime organization (IMO); North Atlantic right whale; Ships' routeing","environmental protection; international organization; population dynamics; population migration; risk assessment; routing; sea ice; species conservation; vessel; whale; marine policy; ship motion; shipping; transportation safety; maritime transportation; migratory population; vessel traffic management system; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Beaufort Sea; Bering Strait; Chukchi Sea; Saint Lawrence Island; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,"Ellis, B., (2009), p. 194. , Brigham L Arctic marine shipping assessment (AMSA) 2009 report.

Bowhead blubber was rich in the following FAs: 14:0, 16:0, 16:1n - 7, 18:0, 18:1n - 11, 18:1n - 9, 18:1n - 7, 20:1n - 11, 20:1n - 9, 20:1n - 7, 20:5n - 3, 22:1n - 11, 22:1n - 9, 22:5n - 3, and 22:6n - 3, which together accounted for 91% of total FAs identified. Four groups of bowhead whales were identified from their FA signatures using multivariate analysis. Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (20:1n - 9, 20:1n - 11, 22:1n - 9, and 22:1n - 11) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (20:5n - 3, 22:5n - 3, 22:6n - 3) accounted for most of the variance among groups. Whales from a single sampling site segregated into different groups, some of which included whales from other sampling sites, suggesting summer mixing of whales from different wintering areas and prey assemblages, or alternatively, selective feeding. FA composition was similar in males and females and among whales of different age classes, which suggests that these different groups shared foraging areas and had similar diets. The blubber of bowhead whales from the eastern Canadian Arctic was composed of high proportions of calanoid copepod markers (20:1n - 9 and 22:1n - 11), especially compared to the adipose tissue of western Arctic bowhead whales. This finding suggests that Calanus spp. were likely a major prey item. Given the expected change in Arctic zooplankton assemblages with climate warming, bowhead whales, through their FA biomarkers, may serve as sentinels of change in Arctic ecosystems. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Arctic;

We found that epiphyseal fusion is initiated in the neck and the sacral region of terrestrial mammals, while in recent aquatic mammals epiphyseal fusion is initiated in the neck and caudal regions, suggesting locomotor pattern and environment affect fusion pattern. We also studied bony fusion of the sacrum and evaluated criteria used to homologize cetacean vertebrae with the fused sacrum of terrestrial mammals. We found that the initial ossification of the vertebral pedicles in the fetus may be a reliable indicator of sacral homology in modern cetaceans. Finally, we also studied fusion of the centra of cervical vertebrae in B. mysticetus and found that it is not completed until after sexual maturity, and after 20 years of age. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cetacea; Epiphyseal; Fusion; Intervertebral; Vertebra",,,,,,,,"Bajpai, S., Thewissen, J.G.M., A new, diminutive Eocene whale from Kachchh (Gujarat, India) and its implications for locomotor evolution of cetaceans (2000) Curr Sci India, 79, pp. 1478-1482; Bebej, R.M., Functional morphology of the vertebral column in Remingtonocetus (Mammalia (2011) Cetacea) and the evolution of aquatic locomotion in early archaeocetes, , PhD Dissertation: University of Michigan; Bebej, R.M., ul-Haq, M., Zalmout, I.S., Gingerich, P.D., Morphology and function of the vertebral column in Remingtonocetus domandaensis (Mammalia, Cetacea) from the middle Eocene Domanda Formation of Pakistan (2012) J Mammal Evol, 19, pp. 77-104; Best, P.B., Lockyer, C.H., Reproduction, growth, and migrations of sei whales Balaenoptera borealis off the west coast of South Africa (2002) S Afr J Marine Sci, 24, pp. 111-133; Bruggeman, B.J., Maier, J.A., Mohiuddin, Y.S., Powers, R., Lo, Y., Guimarães-Camboa, N., Evans, S.M., Arfe, B.D., Avian intervertebral disc arises from rostral sclerotome and lacks a nucleus pulposus: implications for evolution of the vertebrate disc (2012) Dev Dynam, 241, pp. 567-683; Buchholtz, E.A., Implications of vertebral morphology for locomotor evolution in early Cetacea (1998) The Emergence of Whales, Evolutionary Patterns in the Origin of Cetacea, pp. 325-351. , Thewissen JGM, (ed), Plenum Press, New York; Buchholtz, E.A., Vertebral osteology and swimming style in living and fossil whales (Order: Cetacea) (2001) J Zool, 253, pp. 175-190; Buchholtz, E.A., Modular evolution of the cetacean vertebral column (2007) Evol Dev, 9, pp. 278-289. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXntVCnurg%3D, PID: 17501751; Buchholtz, E.A., Vertebral and rib anatomy in Caperea marginata: implications for evolutionary patterning of the mammalian vertebral column (2010) Mar Mammal Sci, 27, pp. 382-397; Buchholtz, E.A., Booth, A.C., Webbnik, K.E., Vertebral anatomy in the Florida manatee, Trichechus manatus latirostris: a developmental and evolutionary analysis (2007) Anat Rec, 290, pp. 624-637; Buchholtz, E.A., Wolkovich, E.M., Cleary, R.J., Vertebral osteology and complexity in Lagenorhynchus acutus (Delphinidae) with comparison to other delphinoid genera (2005) Mar Mammal Sci, 21, pp. 411-428; Chittleborough, R.G., Puberty, physical maturity, and relative growth of the female humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre) on the Western Australian coast (1955) Aust J Mar Fresh Res, 6, pp. 315-327; Cooper, L.N., Thewissen, J.G.M., Bajpai, S., Tiwari, B.N., Postcranial morphology and locomotion of the Eocene raoellid Indohyus (Artiodactyla: Mammalia) (2012) Historical Biol, 24, pp. 279-310; Dawson, A.B., The age order of epiphyseal union in the long bones of the albino rat (1925) Anat Rec, 31, pp. 1-18; Eschricht, D.F., Reinhardt, J., Lilljeborg, W., (1866) Recent Memoirs on the Cetacea, , Flower WH, (ed), Published for the Ray Society by Robert Hardwicke, London; Evans, H.E., (1993) Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog, , WB Saunders Company, Philadelphia; Fish, F.E., Transitions from drag-based to lift-based propulsion in mammalian aquatic swimming (1996) Am Zool, 36, pp. 628-641; Fish, F.E., Peacock, J.E., Rohr, J.J., Stabilization mechanism in swimming odontocetes cetaceans by phased movements (2000) Mar Mammal Sci, 19, pp. 515-528; Fraas, E., Neue Zeuglodonten aus dem unteren Mitteleocän vom Mokattam bei Cairo (1904) Geol Palaeontol Abh, 6, pp. 199-220; Galatius, A., Paedomorphosis in two small species of toothed whales (Odontoceti): how and why?

The large size of bowhead bones, combined with their use as structural elements in Neoeskimo architecture, creates a suite of taphonomic issues that tend to obscure their usefulness as a measure of relative abundance, and thus as an overall economic indicator. Here we present a regional approach that focuses on contrasts in relative taxonomic abundance between sites with diverse economic signatures, supported by related differences in element frequencies, site locations, features, artefact frequencies, and manufacturing detritus. Using this approach, a generalized picture of the relative importance of bowhead whales in Neoeskimo subsistence economies can be assembled. Such an analysis, applied to the archaeological record of the Mackenzie Inuit, or Siglit, reveals the role that bowhead whaling played in subsistence economies from the 15th to 19th centuries AD. Specifically, the archaeological record indicates that the prehistoric Qikiqtaryungmiut and Nuvugarmiut practiced specialized bowhead whaling at coastal promontories, though the seasonal scheduling and success rate of these hunts contrasted considerably.","Bowhead whaling; Mackenzie inuit; Meat weight; Siglit; Specialization",,,,,,,,"Arnold, C., (1992) Report on the 1991 Activities of the Mackenzie Delta Heritage Project: Excavations at McKinley Bay, , Manuscript on File, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, Yellowknife; Begon, M., Harper, J., Townsend, C., (1986) Ecology: Individuals, Populations, and Communities, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland; Betts, M., (2000) Opportunism, Optimality, and the Origin of Species: An Investigation of Thule Subsistence on Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, , Unpublished Masters Thesis, Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Toronto; Betts, M., Seven Focal Economies for Six Focal Places: The Development of Economic Diversity in the Western Canadian Arctic (2005) Arctic Anthropology, 42 (1), pp. 47-87; Betts, M., The Mackenzie Inuit Whale Bone Industry: Raw Material, Tool Manufacture, Scheduling, and Trade (2007) Arctic, 60 (2), pp. 129-144; Betts, M., (2008) Subsistence and Culture in the Western Canadian Arctic: A Multicontextual Approach, , Mercury Series 169, Canadian Museum of Civilization, Gatineau; Betts, M., Chronicling Siglit Identities: Economy, Practice, and Ethnicity in the Western Canadian Arctic (2009) Alaska Journal of Anthropology, 7 (2), pp. 1-28; Betts, M., Friesen, T.M., Quantifying Hunter-Gatherer Intensification: A Zooarchaeological Case Study from Arctic Canada (2004) Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, 23 (4), pp. 357-384; Charnov, E., Orians, G., (1973) Optimal Foraging: Some Theoretical Explorations, , Mimeograph.

Recordings were made in three areas licensed for hydrocarbon exploration, spanning the continental slope and adjacent outer shelf, and in a shallow inner-shelf area where bowheads have been observed congregating to feed in recent decades. Bowhead sounds were counted in samples comprising 10% of each recorded hour. In mid-August and September in all 3 years, the rate of bowhead calling at outer shelf sites exceeded that at adjacent continental slope sites by one to two orders of magnitude. Higher rates of calling occurred on the slope in late July and early August than at later dates. Calling rates varied by an order of magnitude between years in the one area that was monitored in different years. The highest rates of calling occurred on the inner shelf, offshore of the northern Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula. These trends are consistent with patterns of habitat use previously reported from aerial surveys in this and nearby areas of the Beaufort Sea and with the results of satellite tagging studies. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic activity; Aerial surveys; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whales; Continental slope; Hydrocarbon exploration; Orders of magnitude; Passive acoustics; Acoustics; Physics; acoustics; animal; bowhead whale; devices; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; physiology; procedures; season; signal processing; sound detection; time; transducer; vocalization; Acoustics; Animals; Bowhead Whale; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Seasons; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Transducers; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"Imperial Oil Limited

We used satellite telemetry, archival depth recorders, and water column echo sounding data to study bowhead whale diving behavior relative to prey depth and concentration in Disko Bay, West Greenland. Results: Between March and May 2008 to 2011, nine bowhead whales were tagged in Disko Bay, West Greenland with instruments that collected data on location and diving over a period of 1 to 33 days. The frequency of U-dives (presumed to be foraging dives) was low during winter months but more than doubled in spring concurrent with a decrease in diving depth. The mean speed of the horizontal bottom phase of the U-dives was 0.9 ms-1 and on average, whales spent 37% of their time at the bottom phase of the dive. In March, bowhead whales presumably fed on copepods (Calanus spp.) close to the seabed (between 100 and 400 m). In April and May, after the copepods ascended to shallower depths, bowhead whales also dove to shallower depths (approximately 30 m) more often. However, echo sounding surveys in the vicinity of feeding whales in early May indicated that patches of copepods could still be found close to the seabed. Conclusions: There was a marked change in diving behavior from winter through spring and this was likely in response to the changes in sea ice conditions, primary production and potential copepod abundance in the upper part of the water column. Depth and duration of dives changed significantly during this period; however, other dive parameters (for example the proportion of time spent feeding on the bottom of U-dives) remained fairly constant indicating a constant feeding effort. Bowhead whales target copepods at or close to the seabed in winter months in Disko Bay and continue feeding on copepods when they migrate to the surface. However, bowhead whales leave West Greenland before peak abundance of copepods occurs at the surface. © 2013 Heide-Jørgensen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Arctic; Bowhead whale; Calanus; Copepods; Diving behavior; FastLoc GPS tags; Feeding; Greenland",,,,,,,,"Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Laidre, K.L., Wiig, Ø., Postma, L., Dueck, L., Bachmann, L., Large scale sexual segregation of bowhead whales (2011) Endang Species Res, 13, pp. 73-78; Laidre, K.L., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Nielsen, T.G., Role of bowhead whale as a predator in West Greenland (2007) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 346, pp. 285-297; Laidre, K.L., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Spring partitioning of Disko Bay, West Greenland, by Arctic and Subarctic baleen whales (2012) ICES J Mar Sci, 69, pp. 1226-1233; Stafford, K.M., Moore, S.E., Laidre, K.L., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Bowhead whale springtime song off West Greenland (2008) J Acoust Soc Am, 125, pp. 3315-3323; Wiig, Ø., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Lindqvist, C., Laidre, K.L., Postma, I.D., Dueck, L., Palsbøll, P.J., Bachmann, L., Recaptures of genotyped bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus in eastern Canada and West Greenland (2011) Endang Species Res, 14, pp. 235-242; Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Garde, E., Nielsen, N.H., Andersen, O.N., Biological data from the hunt of bowhead whales in West Greenland 2009 and 2010 (2012) J Cetacean Res Manage, 12, pp. 329-333; Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Laidre, K.L., Logsdon, M.L., Nielsen, T.G., Springtime coupling between phytoplankton, sea ice, and sea surface temperature in Disko Bay, West Greenland (2007) Prog Oceanogr, 73, pp. 79-95; Madsen, S.D., Nielsen, T.G., Hansen, B.W., Annual population development and production by Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus in Disko Bay, western Greenland (2001) Mar Biol, 139, pp. 75-93; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Houston, A.I., Carbone, C., The optimal allocation of time during the diving cycle (1992) Behav Ecol, 3, pp. 255-265; Werth, A.J., Models of hydrodynamic flow in the bowhead whale filter feeding apparatus (2004) J Exp Biol, 207, pp. 3569-3580; Kenney, R.D., Hyman, M.A.M., Owen, R.E., Scott, G.P., Winn, H.E., Estimation of prey densities required by North Atlantic right whales (1986) Mar Mam Sci, 2, pp. 1-13; Benoit-Bird, K.J., Battaile, B.C., Heppell, S.A., Hoover, B., Irons, D., Jones, N., Kuletz, K.J., Trites, A.W., Prey patch patterns predict habitat use by top marine predators with diverse foraging strategies PloS ONE, 8; Swalethorp, R., Kjellerup, S., Dünweber, M., Nielsen, T.G., Møller, E.F., Rysgaard, S., Hansen, B.W., Grazing, egg production, and biochemical evidence of differences in the life strategies of Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus in Disko Bay, western Greenland (2011) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 429, pp. 125-144; Moore, S., Craig George, J.C., Sheffield, G., Bacon, J., Ashjian, C., Bowhead whale distribution and feeding near Barrow, Alaska, in late summer 2005-06 (2010) Arctic, 63, pp. 195-205; Le Boeuf, B.J., Costa, D.P., Huntley, A.C., Feldkamp, S.D., Continous, deep diving in female northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris (1988) Can J Zool, 66, pp. 446-458; Nowacek, D.P., Johnson, M.P., Tyack, P., Shorter, K.A., McLellan, W.A., Pabst, D.A., Buoyant balaenids: the ups and downs of buoyancy in right whales (2001) Proc R Soc Lond, pp. 1811-1816. , B268; Jakobsson, M., Macnab, R., Mayer, L., Anderson, R., Edwards, M., Hatzky, J., Schenke, H.W., Johnson, P., An improved bathymetric portrayal of the Arctic Ocean: Implications for ocean modeling and geological, geophysical and oceanographic analyses (2008) Geophys Res Let, 35, p.

In August-October 2007, 35 directional acoustic recorders (DASARs) were deployed at five sites in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Location estimates were obtained for >137,500 individual calls; a subsample of locations with high detection probability was used in the analyses. Call localization rates (CLRs) were compared before, during, and after periods of airgun use between sites near seismic activities (median distance 41-45 km) and sites relatively distant from seismic activities (median distance >104 km). At the onset of airgun use, CLRs dropped significantly at sites near the airguns, where median received levels from airgun pulses (SPL) were 116-129 dB re 1 μPa (10-450 Hz). CLRs remained unchanged at sites distant from the airguns, where median received levels were 99-108 dB re 1 μPa. This drop could result from a cessation of calling, deflection of whales around seismic activities, or both combined, but call locations alone were insufficient to differentiate between these possibilities. Reverberation from airgun pulses could have masked a small number of calls near the airguns, but even if masking did take place, the analysis results remain unchanged. © 2013 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Airgun; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Behavioral disturbance; Bowhead whale; Calling rate; Masking; Migration; Seismic exploration","air gun; behavioral response; calling behavior; deflection; migration; probability; seismic noise; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Blackwell, S.B., Lawson, J.W., Williams, M.T., Tolerance by ringed seals (Phoca hispida) to impact pipe-driving and construction sounds at an oil production island (2004) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 115, pp. 2346-2357; Blackwell, S.B., Richardson, W.J., Greene Jr., C.R., Streever, B., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) migration and calling behaviour in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, autumn 2001-04: An acoustic localization study (2007) Arctic, 60, pp. 255-270; Braham, H., Krogman, B., Leatherwood, S., Preliminary report of the 1978 spring bowhead whale research program results (1979) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 29, pp. 291-306; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multi-model inference: A practical information-theoretic approach, , 2nd edition.

This area has experienced pronounced reduction in the extent of summer sea ice over the last decade, as well as increased anthropogenic activity, particularly in the form of oil and gas exploration. The effects of these changes on marine mammal species are presently unknown. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders were deployed over a wide area of the northeastern Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska from Cape Lisburne to Barrow, at distances from 8. km to 200. km from shore: up to 44 each summer and up to 8 each winter. Acoustic data were acquired at 16. kHz continuously during summer and on a duty cycle of 40 or 48. min within each 4-h period during winter. Recordings were analyzed manually and using automated detection and classification systems to identify calls.Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whale calls were detected primarily from April through June and from September to December during their migrations between the Bering and Beaufort seas. Summer detections were rare and usually concentrated off Wainwright and Barrow, Alaska. Gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale calls were detected between July and October, their occurrence decreasing with increasing distance from shore. Fin (Balaenoptera physalus), killer (Orcinus orca), minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales were detected sporadically in summer and early fall. Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) was the most commonly detected species between June and October, primarily occupying the southern edge of Hanna Shoal and haul-outs near coastal recording stations off Wainwright and Point Lay. Ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals occur year-round in the Chukchi Sea. Ringed seal acoustic detections occurred throughout the year but detection numbers were low, likely due to low vocalization rates. Bearded seal acoustic detections peaked in April and May during their breeding season, with much lower detection numbers in July and August, likely as a result of reduced calling rates after breeding season. Ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata) were only detected in the fall as they migrated south through the study area toward the Bering Sea. These results suggest a regular presence of marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea year-round, with species-dependent seasonal and spatial density variations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic detection; Arctic; Marine mammal; Vocalization","acoustics; anthropogenic effect; breeding season; classification; marine mammal; migration; sea ice; species diversity; vocalization; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Eschrichtius robustus; Histriophoca fasciata; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Odobenidae; Odobenus rosmarus; Orcinus orca; Phoca fasciata; Phoca hispida; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Aerts, L., McFarland, A.E., Watts, B.H., Lomac-MacNair, K.S., Seiser, P.E., Wisdom, S.S., Kirk, A.V., Schudel, C.A., (2013), Marine mammal distribution and abundance in three areas of the offshore northeatern Chukchi Sea during the open-water season.

Killer whales prey on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) of the Eastern Canada-West Greenland (EC-WG) population, but their patterns of predation pressure and effect on the EC-WG population's ability to recover from historical whaling remain unknown. We analyzed photographs of individual bowhead whale flukes from five regions within the EC-WG population's geographic range (Cumberland Sound, Foxe Basin, Isabella Bay, Repulse Bay and Disko Bay), taken during 1986 and from 2007 to 2012, to estimate the occurrence of rake marks (parallel scars caused by killer whale teeth). Of 598 identified whales, 10.2 % bore rake marks from killer whales. A higher occurrence of rake marks was found in Repulse and Disko Bays, where primarily adult bowhead whales occur seasonally, than in Foxe Basin, where juveniles and females with calves occur. Older bowheads, which have had greater exposure time to killer whales due to their age, had higher occurrences of rake marks than juveniles and calves, which may indicate that younger whales do not survive killer whale attacks. A high proportion of adult females also had rake marks, perhaps due to protecting their calves from killer whale predation. In order to quantify the effect of killer whales on EC-WG population recovery, further research is needed on the relationship between the occurrence of rake marks and bowhead adult, calf, and juvenile mortality in the ECA, as well as more information about Arctic killer whale ecology. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bowhead whale; Eastern Canadian Arctic; Killer whale; Population recovery; Predation; Rake marks","adult; global climate; home range; mortality; predation; predator-prey interaction; residence time; sea ice; seasonality; species occurrence; survival; whale; whaling; Arctic; Canada; Greenland; West Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Orcinus orca; Trematoda",,,,,"University of Manitoba, U of M

However, studies to date have focused on terrestrial fauna and there is little understanding of how marine species responded to past climate change. Here we show that a true Arctic species, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), shifted its range and tracked its core suitable habitat northwards during the rapid climate change of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Late Pleistocene lineages survived into the Holocene and effective female population size increased rapidly, concurrent with a threefold increase in core suitable habitat. This study highlights that responses to climate change are likely to be species specific and difficult to predict. We estimate that the core suitable habitat of bowhead whales will be almost halved by the end of this century, potentially influencing future population dynamics. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

While the overall distribution and seasonal movements of bowhead whales are mostly understood, information about their distribution in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in early to mid-summer has not been well documented. In July 2011, we conducted an exploratory flight in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, north of Camden Bay (71°N 144°W), near the location of a single satellite-tagged bowhead whale. Eighteen bowhead whales were observed, and behavior consistent with feeding was documented. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of behavior consistent with feeding north of Camden Bay in mid-July. Few studies have focused on bowhead whale distribution in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in early to mid-summer, and no long-term, region-wide surveys have been conducted during summer. Bowhead whales are already exposed to anthropogenic disturbance in the Canadian Beaufort Sea in summer, the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in fall, and the Chukchi and Bering seas from fall through spring. The presence of bowhead whale aggregations in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in summer should be considered when assessing the cumulative effects of human-related activities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Alaskan Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Camden Bay; Cumulative effects; Summer feeding","Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae",,,,,"Fisheries Joint Management Committee, FJMC

Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature 'racks', in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90'deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles. © 2013.

Extant species have evolved a spectacular array of adaptations in conjunction with their deployment into a diverse array of aquatic habitats. Sensory systems are among those that have experienced radical transformations in the evolutionary history of this clade. In the case of vision, previous studies have demonstrated important changes in the genes encoding rod opsin (RH1), short-wavelength sensitive opsin 1 (SWS1), and long-wavelength sensitive opsin (LWS) in selected cetaceans, but have not examined the full complement of opsin genes across the complete range of cetacean families. Here, we report protein-coding sequences for RH1 and both color opsin genes (SWS1, LWS) from representatives of all extant cetacean families. We examine competing hypotheses pertaining to the timing of blue shifts in RH1 relative to SWS1 inactivation in the early history of Cetacea, and we test the hypothesis that some cetaceans are rod monochomats. Molecular evolutionary analyses contradict the ""coastal"" hypothesis, wherein SWS1 was pseudogenized in the common ancestor of Cetacea, and instead suggest that RH1 was blue-shifted in the common ancestor of Cetacea before SWS1 was independently knocked out in baleen whales (Mysticeti) and in toothed whales (Odontoceti). Further, molecular evidence implies that LWS was inactivated convergently on at least five occasions in Cetacea: (1) Balaenidae (bowhead and right whales), (2) Balaenopteroidea (rorquals plus gray whale), (3) Mesoplodon bidens (Sowerby's beaked whale), (4) Physeter macrocephalus (giant sperm whale), and (5) Kogia breviceps (pygmy sperm whale). All of these cetaceans are known to dive to depths of at least 100 m where the underwater light field is dim and dominated by blue light. The knockout of both SWS1 and LWS in multiple cetacean lineages renders these taxa rod monochromats, a condition previously unknown among mammalian species. © 2013 Meredith et al.",,"scotopsin; opsin;

This bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, here designated the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, runs along the center of the hard palate, expanding cranially to form two large lobes that terminate under the tip of the rostral palate, with another enlarged node at the caudal terminus. Gross anatomical and microscopic observation of tissue sections discloses a web-like internal mass with a large blood volume. Histological examination reveals large numbers of blood vessels and vascular as well as extravascular spaces resembling a blood-filled, erectile sponge. These spaces, as well as accompanying blood vessels, extend to the base of the epithelium. We contend that this organ provides a thermoregulatory adaptation by which bowhead whales (1) control heat loss by transferring internal, metabolically generated body heat to cold seawater and (2) protect the brain from hyperthermia. We postulate that this organ may play additional roles in baleen growth and in detecting prey, and that its ability to dissipate heat might maintain proper operating temperature for palatal mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors to detect the presence and density of intraoral prey.

We collaborated with hunters from the coastal community of Wainwright, Alaska, to document their observations of environmental change (e.g., sea ice, wind, temperature) and the implications of those changes for opportunities to hunt bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) during spring and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) during summer. We integrated hunter observations on wind with statistical analysis of daily wind speed data collected in the nearby community of Barrow, Alaska, between 1971 and 2010 to characterize changes in the number of days with suitable hunting conditions. Hunters in Wainwright currently observe fewer days than in previous decades with wind conditions suitable for safely hunting bowhead whales and caribou. The statistical analysis of wind speed data supported these conclusions and suggested that the annual windows of opportunity for hunting each species have decreased by up to seven days since 1971. This study demonstrates the potential power of collaboration between local communities and researchers to characterize the societal impacts of climate change. Continued collaborative research with residents of rural northern Alaskan communities could produce knowledge and develop tools to help rural Alaskans adapt to novel social-ecological conditions. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Bowhead whale; Caribou; North Slope; Social-ecological system; Wind speed","climate change; deer; environmental change; hunting; latitude; local participation; nature-society relations; rural area; statistical analysis; whale; wind velocity; Alaska; United States; Wainwright; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,,"(2013), http://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/cen/acsdetails.cfm?l=2432&ay=20115&an=Wainwright+city&ds=10, ADLWD (Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development), American community survey: 2007-2011 5-year data for Wainwright city; (2008), Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, Report on weapons, techniques, and observations in the Alaskan bowhead whale subsistence hunt.

Between-eye and within-eye variance components for the ratio of the D and L optical isomers (D/L ratio) were estimated via analysis of variance using multiple measurements from nine whales with both eyes sampled and analyzed. For whales with more than one (D/L)act value, an inverse variance weighted average of the values was used as (D/L)act for the whale. Racemization rate (kAsp) and D/L ratio at birth (D/L)0 were estimated using (D/L)act from 27 bowhead whales with age estimates based on baleen or ovarian corpora data and two term fetuses. The estimates were kAsp = 0.977 × 10-3/yr and (D/L)0 = 0.0250. The nonlinear least squares analysis that produced these estimates also estimated female age at sexual maturity as ASM = 25.86 yr. SE(age) was estimated via a bootstrap that took into account the SE of (D/L)act and the variances and covariance of kAsp and (D/L)0. One male exceeded 100 yr of age; the oldest female was 88. A strong linear relationship between kAsp and body temperature was estimated by combining bowhead data with independent data from studies of humans and fin whales. Using this relationship, we estimated kAsp and ASM for North Atlantic minke whales. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Age at sexual maturity; Age determination; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale","age determination; body temperature; estimation method; harvesting; least squares method; nonlinearity; optical method; racemization; sampling; variance analysis; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Bada, J.L., In vivo racemization in mammalian proteins (1984) Posttranslational Modifications, Methods in Enzymology, 106, pp. 98-115; Bada, J.L., Brown, S., In vivo racemization in teeth and the ocular lens nucleus (1985) Behavior and pathology of aging in rhesus monkeys.

The importance of bone piles to individuals and the population, the patterns of use, and the number, sex, and age of bears using these resources are poorly understood. We implemented barbed-wire hair snaring to obtain genetic identities from bears using the Point Barrow bone pile in winter 2010-11. Eighty-three percent of genotyped samples produced individual and sex identification. We identified 97 bears from 200 samples. Using genetic mark-recapture techniques, we estimated that 228 bears used the bone pile during November to February, which would represent approximately 15% of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear subpopulation, if all bears were from this subpopulation. We found that polar bears of all age and sex classes simultaneously used the bone pile. More males than females used the bone pile, and males predominated in February, likely because 1/3 of adult females would be denning during this period. On average, bears spent 10 days at the bone pile (median = 5 days); the probability that an individual bear remained at the bone pile from week to week was 63% for females and 45% for males. Most bears in the sample were detected visiting the bone pile once or twice. We found some evidence of matrilineal fidelity to the bone pile, but the group of animals visiting the bone pile did not differ genetically from the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation, nor did patterns of relatedness. We demonstrate that bowhead whale bone piles may be an influential food subsidy for polar bears in the Barrow region in autumn and winter for all sex and age classes.","Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; bowhead whale; capture'recapture; genetic tagging; non-invasive; population estimation; subsidy; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS",,"Amstrup, S.C., Stirling, I., Lentfer, J.W., Past and present status of polar bears in alaska (1986) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 14, pp. 241-254; Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Durner, G.M., Using satellite radiotelemetry data to delineate and manage wildlife populations (2004) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 32, pp. 661-679; Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Durner, G.M., Stirling, I., Smith, T.S., Perham, C., Thiemann, G.W., Recent observations of intraspecific predation and cannibalism among polar bears in the southern beaufort sea (2006) Polar Biology, 29, pp. 997-1002; An, J.H., Bechet, A., Berggren, A., Brown, S.K., Bruford, M.W., Cai, Q.G., Cassel-Lundhagen, A., Xu, X.J., Permanent genetic resources added to molecular ecology resources database 1 october 2009-30 november 2009 (2010) Molecular Ecology Resources, 10, pp. 404-408; Arnold, T.W., Uninformative parameters, model selection using akaikés information criterion (2010) Journal of Wildlife Management, 74, pp. 1175-1178; Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, in?

Understanding the demographic component of species' history is fundamental to informed management because changes in effective population size affect response to environmental change and evolvability, the strength of genetic drift, and maintenance of genetic variability. Species experiencing anthropogenic population reductions provide valuable case studies for understanding the genetic response to demographic change because historic changes in the census size are often well documented. A classic example is the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, which experienced dramatic population depletion due to commercial whaling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Consequently, we analyzed a large multi-marker dataset of bowhead whales using a variety of analytical methods, including extended Bayesian skyline analysis and approximate Bayesian computation, to characterize genetic signatures of both ancient and contemporary demographic histories. No genetic signature of recent population depletion was recovered through any analysis incorporating realistic mutation assumptions, probably due to the combined influences of long generation time, short bottleneck duration, and the magnitude of population depletion. In contrast, a robust signal of population expansion was detected around 70,000 years ago, followed by a population decline around 15,000 years ago. The timing of these events coincides to a historic glacial period and the onset of warming at the end of the last glacial maximum, respectively. By implication, climate driven long-term variation in Arctic Ocean productivity, rather than recent anthropogenic disturbance, appears to have been the primary driver of historic bowhead whale demography. This study reports on a demographic reconstruction of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) using multiple genetic markers. The bowhead is a large and long-lived marine mammal species that has been hunted by Inuit communities for many centuries. A dynamic demographic history is reported in which connections between life-history characteristics and ecosystem variability over time are implicated as major demographic determinants, which provides deep historic context to current management strategies. © 2012 The Authors.

In contrast, humpback and bowhead whales produce equally powerful, but more complex broadband vocalizations composed of higher frequencies that suffer from higher attenuation. Here we evaluate the active space of high frequency song notes of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in Western Greenland using measurements of song source levels and ambient noise. Four independent, GPS-synchronized hydrophones were deployed through holes in the ice to localize vocalizing bowhead whales, estimate source levels and measure ambient noise. The song had a mean apparent source level of 185±2 dB rms re 1 μPa @ 1 m and a high mean centroid frequency of 444±48 Hz. Using measured ambient noise levels in the area and Arctic sound spreading models, the estimated active space of these song notes is between 40 and 130 km, an order of magnitude smaller than the estimated active space of low frequency blue and fin whale songs produced at similar source levels and for similar noise conditions. We propose that bowhead whales spatially compensate for their smaller communication range through mating aggregations that co-evolved with broadband song to form a complex and dynamic acoustically mediated sexual display. © 2012 Tervo et al.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; article; Balaena mysticetus; bowhead whale; evolution; global positioning system; mating; noise measurement; nonhuman; prediction; sound detection; velocity; vocalization",,,,,,,"Tyack, P.L., Functional aspects of cetacean communication (2000) Cetacean Societies: Field Studies of Dolphins and Whales, pp. 270-307. , Mann J, Connor RC, Tyack PL, Whitehead H, editors,The University of Chicago Press; Tyack, P.L., Clark, C.W., Communication and Acoustic Behavior of Dolphins and Whales (2000) Hearing by Whales and Dolphins, pp. 156-224. , Au W, Popper A, Fay R, editors,Springer Handbook for Auditory Research; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., Principles of animal communication (1998) Sinauer Associates; Marten, K., Marler, P., Sound transmission and its significance for animal vocalization (1977) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 2, pp. 271-290; Brenowitz, E.A., The active space of red-winged blackbird song (1982) J Comp Physiol A, 147, pp. 511-522; Janik, V.M., Source levels and the estimated active space of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) whistles in the Moray Firth, Scotland (2000) J Comp Physiol A, 186, pp. 673-680; Au, W.W.L., (1993) The sonar of dolphins, p. 277. , Springer New York; Nakano, R., Takanashi, T., Fujii, T., Skals, N., Surlykke, A., Moths are not silent, but whisper ultrasonic courtship songs (2009) J Exp Biol, 212, p. 4078; Clark, C.W., Acoustic behavior of mysticete whales (1990) Sensory Abilities of Cetaceans, pp. 571-583. , Thomas J, Kastelein R editors,Plenum Press New York; Payne, R.S., Webb, D., Orientation by means of long range acoustic signalling in baleen whales (1971) Ann NY Acad Sci, 188, pp. 110-141; Cummings, W.C., Thompson, D., Underwater sounds from the blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus (1971) J Acoust Soc Am, 50, pp. 1193-1198; Cummings, W.C., Thompson, D., Characteristics and seasons of blue and finback whale sounds along the U.S. west coast as recorded at SOSUS stations (1994) J Acoust Soc Am, 95, p. 2853; Watkins, W.A., Tyack, P., Moore, K.E., Bird, J.E., The 20-Hz signals of finback whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1987) J Acoust Soc Am, 82, pp. 1901-1912; Širović, A., Hildebrand, J.A., Wiggins, S.M., Blue and fin whale call source levels and propagation range in the Southern Ocean (2007) J Acoust Soc Am, 122, pp. 1208-1215; Clark, C.W., Matters arising out of the discussion of blue whales (1995) Rep Int Whal Comm, 45, pp. 210-212; Fletcher, N.H., A simple frequency-scaling rule for animal communication (2004) J Acoust Soc Am, 115, pp. 2334-2338; Gillooly, J.F., Ophir, A.G., The energetic basis of acoustic communication (2010) Proc R Soc B, 277, pp. 1325-1331; Poole, J.H., Payne, K., Langbauer Jr., W.R., Moss, C.J., The social contexts of some very low frequency calls of African elephants (1988) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 22, pp. 385-392; Taylor, A.M., Reby, D., The contribution of source-filter theory to mammal vocal communication research, J Zool (2010), 280, pp. 221-236; Brownell, R.L., Ralls, K., Potential for sperm competition in baleen whales (1986) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 8, pp. 110-141; Payne, K., Payne, R., Large scale changes over 19 years in songs of humpback whales in Bermuda (1985) Z Tierpsychol, 68, pp. 89-114; Cerchio, S., Jacobsen, J.K., Norris, T.F., Temporal and geographical variation in songs of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae: synchronous change in Hawaiian and Mexican breeding assemblages (2001) Animal Behav, 62, pp. 313-329; Evans, P.G.H., (1987) The Natural History of Whales and Dolphins, p. 343. , Christopher Helm Ltd; Ljungblad, D., Thompson, P., Moore, S., Underwater sounds recorded from migrating bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, in 1979 (1982) J Acoust Soc Am, 71, pp. 477-482; Cummings, W.C., Holliday, D.V., Sounds and source levels from bowhead whales off Pt.

Box 196612, Anchorage, AK 99519-6612, United States","This paper describes an analysis approach designed to detect the effects of fluctuating anthropogenic underwater sound on the distribution of calling bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) during migration. The anthropogenic sounds in this case were associated with an offshore oil production island (Northstar Island) in the Beaufort Sea northwest of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, but the method has wider applicability. In autumn, bowhead whales migrate westward at varying distances offshore where some are exposed to Northstar sounds. Anthropogenic effects, if present, were hypothesised to be most pronounced in the southern (proximal) part of the migration corridor. Underwater sound levels were measured continuously ca. 500m from Northstar, and locations of calling whales were determined by a seafloor array of directional acoustical recorders. Weighted quantile regression related the 5th quantile of offshore call distance to anthropogenic sounds and other covariates. Case weights were inversely proportional to both probability of detection and location uncertainty. Due to potential dependencies in call locations, block permutation of uncorrelated whale call clusters was used to assign significance levels to coefficients in the quantile regression model. Statistical model selection was used to determine the anthropogenic sound measures most correlated with the 5th quantile of offshore call distances, after allowing for natural within-season variation quantified by day-night changes, distance of the call east or west of Northstar, and date. Data used to illustrate the method were collected over 29 days in September 2003 and included 25,176 bowhead calls. The estimated offshore distance of the 5th quantile call was 0.67km (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 1.05km) farther offshore when tones associated with Northstar were recorded in the 10-450Hz band during the 15 minutes just prior to each call. The method has been applied successfully to similar data collected near Northstar in other years, and may be useful in other studies that simultaneously collect data on animal locations and fluctuating stimuli.","Acoustics; Arctic; Bowhead whale; Migration; Modelling; Monitoring; Movements; Noise; Survey-Acoustic","acoustic data; anthropogenic effect; calling behavior; migration route; movement; oil production; population modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; underwater noise; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Prudhoe Bay; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Alpizar-Jara, R., Pollock, K.H., A combination line transect and capture-recapture sampling model for multiple observers in aerial surveys (1996) Environ.

BWASP was created to specifically address broad-scale research and management questions related to bowhead whale ecology, with particular interest in the potential effects of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on the BCB bowhead whales. With elevated concerns about climate change, increasing oil and gas activities and the forecasted increase in vessel traffic, it is expected that interest in the BWASP dataset will also increase in order to evaluate effects of these anthropogenic activities on BCB bowhead whales and indigenous whaling. The following analysis quantified the spatial characteristics of the BWASP survey design and provided guidelines for the types of investigations that the BWASP data can potentially address. Sampling lags (transect spacing) in the BWASP survey design of approximately 20km along the east/west axis of the study area limit the spatial scale of phenomena that can be detected using data from a single BWASP survey. Therefore, BWASP data are relatively uninformative for studying variability in distribution or relative abundance along the east/west axis over short time scales (one survey) and within small areas measuring less than approximately 20km. In addition, computer simulations showed spatial heterogeneity in the long-term survey coverage probability (the probability that a given location will be included in a survey having an assumed effective search width under the BWASP survey design). Pooled transects created from simulated surveys resulted in a repeating diamond pattern in which coverage probability was low. Analyses incorporating data from many BWASP surveys should account for this spatial heterogeneity, via either the survey coverage probabilities or quantification of survey effort; otherwise estimates of variables such as relative density, density, or habitat use may be biased. The BWASP surveys have increased understanding of the broad-scale patterns of bowhead distribution, relative abundance and behaviour. The utility of this dataset in informing other questions will depend upon the scale of the ecological phenomena under investigation and the analytical scales used to address the questions.","Arctic; Beaufort sea; Bowhead Whale; Distribution; Line transect; Modelling; Northern hemisphere; Survey-Aerial","abundance; aerial survey; habitat management; human activity; hydrocarbon exploration; line transect; population distribution; quantitative analysis; stock assessment; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae",,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J.A., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y.H., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution, and Inupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska (2010) Arctic, 63 (2), pp. 179-194; Dungan, J.L., Perry, J.N., Dale, M.R.T., Legendre, P., Citron-Pousty, S., Fortin, M.J., Jakomulska, A., Rosenberg, M.S., A balanced view of scale in spatial statistical analysis (2002) Ecography, 25, p. 62640; Givens, G.H., (2009) Spatio-temporal Modeling of Relative Animal Density Using a Long Time Series of Line Transect Surveys with Clustering and Censoring, p. 18. , Paper SC/61/BRG1 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee, June 2009, Madeira, Portugal (unpublished) [Paper available from the Office of this Journal]; Houghton, J.P., Segar, D.A., Zeh, J.E., (1984) Beaufort Sea Monitoring Program: Proceedings of a Workshop, p. 111. , September 1983 and sampling design recommendations Prepared by Dames and Moore, Seattle, WA, for the OCS Environmental Assessment Program, Juneau, AK; Keitt, T.H., Bivand, R., Pebesma, E., Rowlingson, B., (2010) Rgdal: Bindings for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal, R package version 0.6-24.

Torrey Pines Ct, La Jolla, CA, 92037, United States","Sea ice is believed to be a major factor shaping gene flow for polar marine organisms, but it remains unclear to what extent it represents a true barrier to dispersal for arctic cetaceans. Bowhead whales are highly adapted to polar sea ice and were targeted by commercial whalers throughout Arctic and subarctic seas for at least four centuries, resulting in severe reductions in most areas. Both changing ice conditions and reductions due to whaling may have affected geographic distribution and genetic diversity throughout their range, but little is known about range-wide genetic structure or whether it differed in the past. This study represents the first examination of genetic diversity and differentiation across all five putative stocks, including Baffin Bay-Davis Strait, Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin, Bering-Beaufort-Chukchi, Okhotsk, and Spitsbergen. We also utilized ancient specimens from Prince Regent Inlet (PRI) in the Canadian Arctic and compared them with modern stocks. Results from analysis of molecular variance and demographic simulations are consistent with recent and high gene flow between Atlantic and Pacific stocks in the recent past. Significant genetic differences between ancient and modern populations suggest PRI harbored unique maternal lineages in the past that have been recently lost, possibly due to loss of habitat during the Little Ice Age and/or whaling. Unexpectedly, samples from this location show a closer genetic relationship with modern Pacific stocks than Atlantic, supporting high gene flow between the central Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea over the past millennium despite extremely heavy ice cover over much of this period.© 2012 The Authors.Ecology and Evolution published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ancient DNA; Arctic; Cetacean; Marine mammal; Mitochondrial DNA; Whaling",,,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Palumbi, S.R., Comparing evolutionary patterns and variability in the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b in three species of Baleen whales (2009) J.

However, climate change, through effects on ice conditions and prey availability, is one of several threats that might affect bowhead whale recovery. In this study, we exploited the variability observed in isotopic signatures of prey assemblages across the eastern Arctic to examine variability in diet among bowhead whales (n = 202) and identify their potential foraging areas. We compared δ13C and δ15N isotope ratios of biopsied skin samples with those of potential zooplankton prey species collected across the Canadian eastern Arctic, and calculated the proportional contributions of various sources (zooplankton) to the diet of bowhead whales using a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model. A cluster analysis indicated some variability in isotopic composition among groups of individuals, but not between males and females or age classes. The isotopic model discounted Davis Strait and Disko Bay as potential foraging areas for bowhead whales, at least in spring and summer. Lancaster Sound, Baffin Bay and the Gulf of Boothia were the 3 main areas likely used for summer feeding, where bowhead whales fed primarily on large Arctic calanoid copepods (Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis, Metridia longa, and Paraeuchaeta spp.), mysids and euphausiids. While some inter-individual variability in diet was observed, the strong dependence of this endemic Arctic species on Arctic zooplankton may make them vulnerable to the predicted latitudinal shift in prey species composition caused by ongoing warming. © Inter-Research and Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012.","Bayesian mixing model; Bowhead whale; Canadian Arctic; Diet; Foraging behaviour; Marine mammal; SIAR; Stable isotopes; Trophic ecology; Zooplankton","age class; annual variation; Bayesian analysis; carbon isotope; climate change; crustacean; diet; endemic species; feeding ground; fishing; isotopic composition; latitudinal gradient; nitrogen isotope; prey availability; sea ice; spatial distribution; trophic interaction; vulnerability; warming; whale; zooplankton; Arctic; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Davis Strait; Disko Bay; Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Calanoida; Calanus hyperboreus; Copepoda; Euphausiacea; Euphausiidae; Mammalia; Metridia longa; Mysida; Paraeuchaeta",,,,,,,"(2004) Impacts of A Warming Arctic, , ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment).

This region is strongly influenced by episodic upwelling events. A systematic aerial survey (10% coverage) was flown over the eastern shelf on 2 August 2008, revealing large numbers of bowheads (est. 3500 individuals) in a clumped distribution over the continental shelf. Between 7 and 11 August 2008, zooplankton samples and hydrography were obtained from the vicinity of two bowhead feeding aggregations, one at the northeast edge of the continental shelf, and the second off the northeast shore of the Cape Bathurst. Dense aggregations of zooplankton were found in the lower part of the water column (below 40. m), on the shelf, in water with an upwelling signature. The zooplankton were largely resting phases of calanoid copepods (Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis) and collectively had twice the abundance, twice the biomass, three times the caloric density and thus six times the energy content of contemporaneous zooplankton samples from the western Canadian Beaufort Shelf. Although upwelling at Cape Bathurst is wind-driven and thus episodic in nature, its consistent delivery of zooplankton to the bowhead foraging area creates conditions attractive to bowhead whales, with an estimated 33% of the bowhead population present on the eastern portion of the shelf at the time of the August 2008 aerial survey. © 2012.","Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Energetics; Feeding; Upwelling; Zooplankton","Balaena mysticetus; Beaufort sea; Bowhead whale; Energetics; Upwelling; Zooplankton; Surveys; Feeding; aerial survey; aggregation behavior; bioenergetics; biomass; community composition; crustacean; feeding ground; food availability; hydrography; population distribution; resting stage; upwelling; whale; zooplankton; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Cape Bathurst Polynya; Northwest Territories; Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Calanoida; Calanus hyperboreus; Copepoda",,,,,"Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa WyÅ¼szego, MNiSW: SPUB 62/W-NOGAP/2009/0, SPUB 289/W-NOGAP/2008/0","This study was part of the Nahidik Program led by Donald Cobb.

The general goal of these projects was to improve our understanding of how the response of arctic marine ecosystems to climate warming will alter food web structure and ecosystem services provided to Northerners. At least four key findings from these projects relating to arctic heterotrophic food web, pelagic-benthic coupling and biodiversity have emerged: (1) Contrary to a long-standing paradigm of dormant ecosystems during the long arctic winter, major food web components showed relatively high level of winter activity, well before the spring release of ice algae and subsequent phytoplankton bloom. Such phenological plasticity among key secondary producers like zooplankton may thus narrow the risks of extreme mismatch between primary production and secondary production in an increasingly variable arctic environment. (2) Tight pelagic-benthic coupling and consequent recycling of nutrients at the seafloor characterize specific regions of the Canadian Arctic, such as the North Water polynya and Lancaster Sound. The latter constitute hot spots of benthic ecosystem functioning compared to regions where zooplankton-mediated processes weaken the pelagic-benthic coupling. (3) In contrast with another widely shared assumption of lower biodiversity, arctic marine biodiversity is comparable to that reported off Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada, albeit threatened by the potential colonization of subarctic species. (4) The rapid decrease of summer sea-ice cover allows increasing numbers of killer whales to use the Canadian High Arctic as a hunting ground. The stronger presence of this species, bound to become a new apex predator of arctic seas, will likely affect populations of endemic arctic marine mammals such as the narwhal, bowhead, and beluga whales. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Arctic marine; Arctic Sea; Beluga whales; Benthic ecosystems; Canadian Arctic; Climate warming; Ecosystem services; Food webs; High arctic; Hot spot; Hunting grounds; Ice algae; International polar year; International researches; Killer whale; Pelagic-benthic coupling; Phytoplankton bloom; Primary production; Sea floor; Sea-ice cover; Secondary production; Biodiversity; Mammals; Phenols; Sea ice; Water recycling; Ecosystems; arctic environment; benthic-pelagic coupling; ecosystem service; food web; heterogeneity; hunting; ice cover; marine ecosystem; nutrient cycling; phenology; phytoplankton; primary production; research program; sea ice; species diversity; subarctic region; subspecies; whale; zooplankton; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Lancaster Sound; North Water Polynya; Nunavut; algae; Balaena mysticetus; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Monodon; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"Alonso-Saez, L., Galand, P.E., Casamayor, E.O., Pedros-Alio, C., Bertilsson, S., High bicarbonate assimilation in the dark by Arctic bacteria (2010) ISME J, 4, pp. 1581-1590; Arashkevich, E., Wassmann, P., Pasternak, A., Riser, C.W., Seasonal and spatial changes in biomass, structure, and development progress of the zooplankton community in the Barents Sea (2002) J Mar Sys, 38, pp. 125-145; Archambault, P., Snelgrove, P.V.R., Fisher, J.A.D., Gagnon, J.M., Garbary, D.J., Harvey, M., Kenchington, E.L., Poulin, M., From sea to sea: Canada's three oceans of biodiversity (2010) PLoS One, 5, pp. e12182. , doi:12110.11371/journal.pone.0012182; (2011) Beaufort Regional Environmental Assessment (BREA), p. 156. , ArcticNet, Beaufort Sea Data Mining Project Report.

The species has maintained levels of mtDNA diversity over 10,000 yr comparable to other nonbottlenecked large whale species. When compared to data from the Holocene East Greenland/Spitsbergen and contemporary Bering-Chuckchi-Beaufort populations, differentiation was low (F ST≤ 0.005, Φ ST≤ 0.003) and no temporal or geographical genetic structuring was evident. A combination of analyses suggests that the population has expanded over the past 30,000 14C yr. This genetic signature of expansion could result from population growth, admixture of multiple gene pools, or a combination of both scenarios. Despite known climatic change that altered bowhead distribution and led to isolation of populations, there is no detectable population structuring or change in genetic diversity during the Holocene. This may be due to long generation time, occasional population connectivity and a historically large global population. These characteristics warrant caution when interpreting contemporary bowhead whale DNA data, as it is unlikely that any population will be in mutation-drift equilibrium. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Ancient DNA; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Climate change; Genetic diversity; Holocene; Mitochondrial DNA; Population structure","carbon isotope; climate variation; connectivity; demography; genetic variation; Holocene; mitochondrial DNA; molecular analysis; paleoclimate; population distribution; population genetics; population structure; whale; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 333, pp. 27-34; Bandelt, H., Forster, P., Röhl, A., Median-joining networks for inferring intraspecific phylogenies (1999) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 16, pp. 37-48; Barnes, I., Matheus, P., Shapiro, B., Jensen, D., Cooper, A., Dynamics of Pleistocene population extinctions in Beringian brown bears (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2267-2270; Borge, T., Bachmann, L., Bjornstad, G., Wiig, O., Genetic variation in Holocene bowhead whales from Svalbard (2007) Molecular Ecology, 16, pp. 2223-2235; Chan, Y.L., Lacey, E.A., Pearson, O.P., Hadly, E.A., Ancient DNA reveals Holocene loss of genetic diversity in a South American rodent (2005) Biology Letters, 1, pp. 423-426; Chan, Y.L., Anderson, C.N.K., Hadly, E.A., Bayesian estimation of the timing and severity of a population bottleneck from ancient DNA (2006) PLoS Genetics, 2, pp. 451-460; Christensen, I., Haug, T., Oien, N., Seasonal distribution, exploitation and present abundance of stocks of large baleen whales (Mysticeti) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Norwegian and adjacent waters (1992) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 49, pp. 341-355; Clark, P.U., Dyke, A.S., Shakun, J.D., The last glacial maximum (2009) Science, 325, pp. 710-714; Cooper, A., Poinar, H.N., Ancient DNA: Do it right or not at all (2000) Science, 289, pp. 1139-1139; (2009), COSEWIC..

Data on movements, habitat use, and phenology were collected from tagged 49 bowheads and 44 humpbacks during the transition from sea-ice breakup to open water between 2008 and 2010. Bowhead whales began their northward spring migration around 27 May (median day-of-the-year departure date 147, interquartile range 141153) and were distributed broadly in northern and central Disko Bay in water depths between 100 and 400 m. Humpback whales arrived in Disko Bay no later than 2 June and were located in shallow water (<100 m) along the coasts of the mainland or Disko Island. Trends in departure date from Disko Bay were significant for bowhead whales (∼15 d later, p < 0.001) between two periods: 20012006 and 20082010. Many species are predicted to arrive earlier in the Arctic and to expand their range northwards with reduced sea ice and increasing temperatures under climate change. Quantifying the spatial and temporal relationships between co-occurring Arctic and Subarctic top predators allows for baseline insight to be gained on how climate change might alter interspecies interactions. © 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

All bowhead whale populations were greatly reduced by commercial whaling from the 1600s through the 1800s, with the largest, the Spitsbergen population in the North Atlantic, depleted to the point of extinction. Recent sightings of bowhead whales west of Svalbard precipitated an effort to listen for their vocalizations via 2 re -corders deployed in 2008 on oceanographic moorings spaced 95 km apart at 78.8 o N latitude in the Fram Strait. Year-round acoustic records were examined for the occurrence of bowhead whale sounds. Simple calls, call sequences, and complex songs were recorded. Repeated call sequences or bowhead whale songs were detected nearly every hour from early November 2008 through late April 2009 on the western Fram Strait recorder. More than 60 unique songs were recorded from October 2008 to April 2009. In contrast, simple calls and call sequences were the most common signals recorded on the central Fram Strait instrument. Peak levels of song production coincided with the period of lowest water temperature, dense ice concentration, and almost complete darkness. Given the diversity, loudness, and period over which songs were recorded, western Fram Strait appears to be a wintering ground-and potentially a mating area-for this Critically Endangered population of bowhead whales. © Inter-Research 2012.","Acoustic sampling; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Fram strait; Sea ice; Song","cetacean; endangered species; population dynamics; sea ice; species diversity; whale; whaling; acoustics; biodiversity; song; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Fram Strait",,,,,,,"Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic, 1611-1911, population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environ Hist, 12, pp. 89-113; Cavalieri, D., Markus, T., Comiso, J., Updated daily AMSR-E/Aqua daily L3 125 km brightness, temperature, sea ice concentration, & snow depth Polar grids V002 (2004) National Snow and Ice Data Center Digital Media, , [9/2008-8/2009]Boulder, CO; Citta, J.J., Quakenbush, L.T., George, J.C., Small, R.J., Winter movements of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Bering Sea (2012) Arctic, 65, pp. 13-34; Clark, C., Ellison, W., Beeman, K., Acoustic tracking of migrating bowhead whales.

In June 2008, an aggregation of belugas and bowheads was identified at the Franklin Bay ice edge in the eastern Beaufort Sea, adjacent to the Cape Bathurst polynya. We conducted five ice-edge surveys by helicopter to study the distribution and behaviour of the whales. Bowheads were sighted in significantly shallower water than belugas. In addition, we used the helicopter platform to observe behaviour. Belugas and bowheads were engaged in directed travel and diving near and under the ice. Five beluga dives were timed and found to have an average duration of 106 ± 61 s (± SD) and a range of 30-197 s. One bowhead under-ice dive was timed and had a duration of 417 s. The under-ice dives are consistent with feeding behaviour observed for belugas and bowheads in other ice-edge locations. We hypothesize that higher prey densities along the Franklin Bay ice edge than in the adjacent open water may attract belugas and bowheads to the ice edge in June. Further research is needed to identify the abundance and type of prey species consumed and to assess the relative energetic importance of spring ice-edge feeding to the eastern Beaufort Sea beluga and bowhead populations. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Aerial survey; Balaena mysticetus; Delphinapterus leucas; Diving behaviour; Fast ice; Floe edge; Habitat selection; Polynyas","aerial survey; aggregation behavior; behavioral ecology; bioenergetics; biological production; diving behavior; feeding; habitat selection; ice cover; open water; polynya; population distribution; prey availability; species occurrence; whale; Arctic Ocean; Bathurst [New Brunswick]; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Franklin Bay; New Brunswick; Northwest Territories; Balaena mysticetus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus; Delphinapterus leucas",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Pease, C.H., Roach, A.T., Salo, S.A., (1989) Beaufort Sea Mesoscale Circulation Study-Final Report, p. 114. , http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/publications/search_abstract.php?fmContributionNum=1155, NOAA Technical Memorandum ERL PMEL-90; Ainley, D.G., Tynan, C.T., Stirling, I., Sea ice: A critical habitat for polar marine mammals and birds (2003) Sea ice: An introduction to its physics, chemistry, biology and geology, pp. 240-266. , Thomas, D.N., and Dieckmann, G.S., eds., Oxford: Blackwell Science Limited; Asselin, N.C., Barber, D.G., Stirling, I., Ferguson, S.H., Richard, P.R., Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) habitat selection in the eastern Beaufort Sea in spring, 1975-1979 (2011) Polar Biology, 34 (12), pp. 1973-1988. , doi:10.1007/s00300-011-0990-5; Barber, D.G., Asplin, M.G., Gratton, Y., Lukovich, J.V., Galley, R.J., Raddatz, R.L., Leitch, D., The International Polar Year (IPY) Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) system study: Overview and the physical system (2010) Atmosphere Ocean, 48 (4), pp. 225-243; Benoit, D., Simard, Y., Fortier, L., Hydroacoustic detection of large winter aggregations of arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) at depth in ice-covered Franklin Bay (Beaufort Sea) (2008) Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 113 (C6). , doi:10.1029/2007jc004276; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Occurrence, habitat use, and behavior of seabirds, marine mammals, and arctic cod at the Pond Inlet ice edge (1982) Arctic, 35 (1), pp. 28-40; Braham, H.W., Fraker, M.A., Krogman, B.D., Spring migration of the western Arctic population of bowhead whales (1980) Marine Fisheries Review, 42 (9-10), pp. 36-46; Carroll, G.M., Smithhisler, J.R., Observations of bowhead whales during spring migration (1980) Marine Fisheries Review, 42 (9-10), pp. 80-85; Carroll, G.M., George, J.C., Lowry, L.F., Coyle, K.O., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) feeding near Point Barrow, Alaska, during the 1985 spring migration (1987) Arctic, 40 (2), pp. 105-110; (2008), http://www.ec.gc.ca/glaces-ice/default.asp?lang=En&n=E4B3AD2B-, CIS (Canadian Ice Service)., Latest ice conditions; Coachman, L.K., Aagaard, K., Physical oceanography of Arctic and Subarctic seas (1974) Marine Geology and Oceanography of the Arctic Seas, pp. 1-72. , Herman, Y., ed., New York: Springer- Verlag; Cosens, S.E., Dueck, L.P., Group size and activity patterns of belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros) during spring migration in Lancaster Sound (1991) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 69 (6), pp. 1630-1635; Craig, P.C., Griffiths, W.B., Haldorson, L., McElderry, H., Ecological studies of arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in Beaufort Sea coastal waters, Alaska (1982) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 39 (3), pp. 395-406; Crawford, R., Jorgenson, J., Density distribution of fish in the presence of whales at the Admiralty Inlet landfast ice edge (1990) Arctic, 43 (3), pp. 215-222; Crawford, R., Jorgenson, J., Schooling behavior of arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, in relation to drifting pack ice (1993) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 36 (4), pp. 345-357; Croll, D.A., Marinovic, B., Benson, S., Chavez, F.P., Black, N., Ternullo, R., Tershy, B.R., From wind to whales: Trophic links in a coastal upwelling system (2005) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 289, pp. 117-130; Dahl, T.M., Lydersen, C., Kovacs, K.M., Falk-Petersen, S., Sargent, J., Gjertz, I., Gulliksen, B., Fatty acid composition of the blubber in white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (2000) Polar Biology, 23 (6), pp. 401-409; (2000) Eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga Whales.

Previous age estimates were compiled from several techniques, each of which is valid over a relatively limited set of physical characteristics. The best fitting single-stage growth model was a variation of the von Bertalanffy growth model for both baleen and body length data. Based on Bayesian information criterion, the two- and threestage versions of the von Bertalanffy model fit the data better than did the single-stage models for both baleen and body length. The best baleen length models can be used to estimate expected ages for bowhead whales with up to 300-325 cm baleen, depending on sex, which correspond to age estimates approaching 60 years. The best body length models can be used to estimate expected ages for male bowhead whales up to 14 m, and female bowheads up to 15.5 m or ages up to approximately 40 years.","Balaena mysticetus; Baleen; Bowhead whale; Gompertz; Growth model; Von Bertalanffy","age determination; anatomy; Bayesian analysis; biological characteristics; body size; sex-related difference; von Bertalanffy equation; whale",,,,,,,"Borelli, R.L., Coleman, C.S., (1987) Differential equations: A modeling approach, , Prentice-Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, N.

Over 3,600 photographs were analyzed including photos from surveys in spring and late summer and in both the western and eastern Beaufort Sea. Of all the photographs analyzed, 64% were scored as definitively muddy. In spring, ratios ranged from a low of 27% in 2003 to a high of 76% in 2004. When all May sample sets off Barrow were combined (1985, 1986, 2003, 2004), there was a significant difference (t-test, P < 0.004) between the proportion of muddy juveniles to the proportion of muddy adults, with muddy adults being more common. The Barrow area was a commonly used feeding ground during migrations in both the spring (61% of the sample were feeding; 55% epibenthically) and autumn (99% of the sample; 97% epibenthically). Bowheads both migrate and feed through areas where petroleum extraction is underway and anticipated; hence, exposure to oil after a spill is of considerable concern to Native communities and management agencies. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy Published 2011.

To fill this gap, data on eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) bowhead whales and their habitat were collected and analyzed. We selected governmental, private, and historical whaling bowhead location datasets which differed in temporal and spatial extent, sample size, and quality. Sufficient data were available only for the 'reduced-ice' period (June to October) and pooled by month. Data for 6 ecogeographical variables (EGVs) were integrated into a geographical information system (GIS): sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, ice, depth, slope, and distance to shore. A monthly ecological niche factor analysis was performed for each whale and EGV dataset to determine habitat suitability in the ECA. Eleven habitat suitability models were produced, and a composite map of predicted high suitability habitat, for all 5 months, was developed. Twenty-one areas within the ECA were identified as highly suitable habitat and ranked according to analytical confidence. Six critical habitats were identified and are supported by recent scientific evidence and Inuit knowledge. Recently, the population estimate, conservation status, and management of the Eastern Canada-West Greenland bowhead population have changed dramatically (bowhead whales of this population also inhabit the ECA). In parallel, evidence of ecological change from climate warming has increased and associated loss of sea ice is anticipated to increase interactions between bowheads and anthropogenic activity. As envisioned by the recovery team, this study provides resource managers with a timely tool for population recovery, conservation, and protection. © Inter-Research 2012.","Bowhead whale; Climate change; Critical habitat; Eastern canadian arctic; Ecological niche factor analysis; Ecological niche modeling; Habitat suitability; Management; Species recovery","climate change; conservation status; data set; ecological modeling; factor analysis; GIS; habitat use; niche; population estimation; species conservation; whale; climate change; conservation management; ecological impact; endangered species; factor analysis; GIS; habitat structure; human activity; whale; Arctic; Canada; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Balaenidae",,,,,,,"Allen, B.M., Angliss, R.P., (2009) Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), , www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/sars/ak2010whbh-arw.pdf, Western Arctic stock.

Copepods showed a lesser escape response to baleen and to a model head simulating balaenid oral hydrodynamics than to other objects. Copepod escape response increased as water flow and body size increased and was greatest at distances ≥10cm from baleen and at copepod density = 10,000m-3. Data from light/dark experiments suggest that escape is based on mechanoreception, not vision. The model head captured 88 of copepods. Results support previous research showing hydrodynamic effects within a whales oral cavity create slight suction pressures to draw in prey or at least preclude formation of an anterior compressive bow wave that could scatter or alert prey to the presence of the approaching whale. © 2012 Alexander J.

From an initial focus on sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and right whales (Eubalaena spp.), the array of targeted whales expanded to include bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Extensive records of American whaling in the form of daily entries in whaling voyage logbooks contain a great deal of information about where and when the whalemen found whales. We plotted daily locations where the several species of whales were observed, both those caught and those sighted but not caught, on world maps to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of both American whaling activity and the whales. The patterns shown on the maps provide the basis for various inferences concerning the historical distribution of the target whales prior to and during this episode of global whaling. © 2012 Smith et al.",,"article; bowhead whale; fishing; geographic distribution; humpback whale; nonhuman; population distribution; seasonal variation; species distribution; sperm whale; animal; audiovisual equipment; demography; food industry; geography; history; human; methodology; population dynamics; season; species difference; statistics; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Animals; Demography; Fisheries; Geography; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Maps as Topic; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Species Specificity; Whales",,,,,,,"Williams, M.J., Ausubel, J., Poiner, I., Garcia, S.M., Baker, D.J., Making marine life count: a new baseline for policy (2010) PLoS Biol, 8 (10), pp. e1000531; Jackson, B.C., Alexander, K.E., Sala, E., Shifting baselines: the past and the future of ocean fisheries (2011), Washington, Island Press; Starkey, D.J., Holm, P., Barnard, M., Oceans past: management insights from the history of marine animal populations (2008), London, Earthscan; Reeves, R.R., Smith, T.D., A taxonomy of world whaling: operations and eras (2006) Whales, Whaling and Ocean Ecosystems, pp. 82-101. , In: Estes JA, DeMaster DP, Doak DF, Williams TM, Brownell RL, editors, Berkeley, University of California Press; Tillman, M.F., Breiwick, J.M., Estimates of abundance for the western North Pacific sperm whale based upon historical whaling records (1983) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 5, pp. 257-269; Whitehead, H., Estimates of the current global population size and historical trajectory for sperm whales (2002) Mar Ecol Progr Ser, 242, pp. 295-304; Bannister, J.L., Taylor, S., Sutherland, H., Logbook records of 19th century American sperm whaling: a report on the 12 month project, 1978-79 (1981) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 821-833; Bockstoce, J.R., Botkin, D.B., The historical status and reduction of the western Arctic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) population by the pelagic whaling industry, 1848-1914 (1983) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 5, pp. 107-142; Josephson, E.A., Smith, T.D., Reeves, R.R., Historical distribution of right whales in the North Pacific (2008) Fish and Fisheries, 9, pp. 1-14; Maury, M.F., (1852) Whale chart of the world (the wind and current charts), , Series F.

We provide a comprehensive review of the history and ecology of killer whales in the Canadian Arctic, for which there has previously been little information. We compiled a database of 450 sightings spanning over 15 decades (1850-2008) to document the historical occurrence, distribution, feeding ecology, and seasonality of killer whales observed throughout the region. Sighting reports per decade increased substantially since 1850 and were most frequent in the eastern Canadian Arctic. The mean reported group size was 8.3 (median = 4, range 1-100), but size varied significantly among regions and observed prey types. Observations of predation events indicate that Canadian Arctic killer whales prey upon other marine mammals. Monodontids were the most frequently observed prey items, followed by bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), phocids, and groups of mixed mammal prey. No killer whale sightings occurred during winter, with sightings gradually increasing from early spring to a peak in summer, after which sightings gradually decreased. Our results suggest that killer whales are established, at least seasonally, throughout the Canadian Arctic, and we discuss potential ecological implications of increased presence with declining sea ice extent and duration. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Abundance; Climate change; Distribution; Inuit traditional ecological knowledge; Marine mammals; Predation; Sea ice; Seasonal movements; Sightings","abundance; climate change; feeding behavior; group size; observational method; population distribution; predator-prey interaction; sea ice; seasonality; whale; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Mammalia; Monodontidae; Orcinus orca; Phocidae",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., Status of killer whales, Orcinus orca, in Canada (2001) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 115, pp. 676-701; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Occurrence and behaviour of transient killer whales: Seasonal and pod-specific variability, foraging behaviour, and prey handling (1995) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 73, pp. 1300-1311; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Ecological and social determinants of group size in transient killer whales (1996) Behavioral Ecology, 7, pp. 408-416; Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Variation in saddle patch pigmentation in populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) from British Columbia, Alaska, and Washington State (1988) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 66, pp. 2582-2585; Bigg, M.A., Olesiuk, P.F., Ellis, G.M., Ford, J.K.B., Balcomb III, K.C., Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State (1990) Report of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 383-405. , Special Issue 12; Bradburn, N.M., Rips, L.J., Shevell, S.K., Answering autobiographical questions: The impact of memory and inference on surveys (1987) Science, 236, pp. 157-161; Brody, H., Land occupancy: Inuit perceptions (1976) Inuit land use and occupancy project.

Box 69, Barrow, AK 99723, United States","Collection of minimally invasive biopsy samples has become an important method to establish normal stable isotopes reference ranges in various wildlife species. Baseline data enhance the understanding of feeding ecology, habitat use, and potential food limitation in apparently healthy, free-ranging cetaceans. Epidermis and muscle were collected from subsistence-hunted northern Alaskan bowhead (n= 133 epidermis/134 muscle) and beluga whales (n= 42/49) and subsistence-hunted Russian gray whales (n= 25/17). Additional samples were obtained from gray whales stranded in California (n= 18/11) during mortality events (1999, 2000). Both δ 15N and δ 13C are trophic position and benthic/pelagic feeding indicators, respectively, in muscle and epidermis. Epidermis is generally enriched in 15N over muscle, while epidermal 13C is more depleted. Lipid extraction does not alter δ 15N in either tissue, but affects epidermal δ 13C. Nitrogen-15 is enriched in muscle, but not epidermis of stranded compared to subsistence-hunted gray whales, indicating probable protein catabolism and nutritional stress in stranded whales. Similarly, epidermal δ 13C of harvested whales is lower than in stranded whales, suggesting depleted lipid stores and/or food limitation in stranded animals. Epidermal isotope signatures are similar in both present-day bowheads and in an ancient sample from the Northern Bering Sea region. Although only one specimen, this suggests trophic level of the ancient whale compares to modern bowheads after a millennium. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Beluga whale; Bowhead whale; Feeding ecology; Food limitation; Gray whale; Stable isotopes","carbon isotope; catabolism; epidemic; feeding ecology; food limitation; habitat use; isotopic ratio; lipid; muscle; nitrogen isotope; protein; stable isotope; trophic level; whale; wild population; Alaska; Bering Sea; California; Pacific Ocean; United States; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Eschrichtiidae",,,,,,,"Abend, A.G., Smith, T.D., Differences in stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen between long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and their primary prey in the western north Atlantic (1997) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 54, pp. 500-503; Adams, M., Frost, K.J., Harwood, L.A., Alaska and Inuvialuit beluga whale committee (AIBWC)-an initiative in ""at home management"" (1993) Arctic, 46, pp. 34-137; Adams, T.S., Sterner, R.W., The effect of dietary nitrogen content on trophic level 15N enrichment (2000) Limnology and Oceanography, 45, pp. 601-607; Baum, C., Meyer, W., Roessner, D., Siebers, D., Fleischer, L.-G., A zymogel enhances the self-cleaning abilities of the skin of the pilot whale (Globicephala melas) (2001) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A, 130, pp. 835-847; Block, R.J., Bolling, D., The amino acid composition of keratins.

We followed 11 whales through the winter of 2008-09 and 10 whales in 2009-10. The average date that bowhead whales entered the Bering Sea was 14 December in 2008 and 26 November in 2009. All but one tagged whale entered the Bering Sea west of Big Diomede Island. In the winter of 2008-09, whales were distributed in a line extending from the Bering Strait to Cape Navarin, whereas in 2009-10, the distribution shifted south of St. Lawrence Island, extending from Cape Navarin to St. Matthew Island. Bowhead whales were most likely to be found in areas with 90%-100% sea-ice concentration and were generally located far from the ice edge and polynyas. The average date whales left the Bering Sea was 12 April in 2009 and 22 April in 2010. During the spring migration, all whales but one traveled north along the Alaska coast to summering grounds in the Canadian Beaufort. The remaining whale migrated a month later and traveled up the northern coast of Chukotka, where it was located when the tag stopped transmitting in August. It is unlikely that this whale migrated to the Beaufort Sea before returning south to winter within the Bering Sea, indicating the movements of bowhead whales are more complex than generally believed. Declining sea ice in the Bering Sea may result in the expansion of commercial fisheries and shipping; areas where such activities may overlap the winter range of bowhead whales include the Bering and Anadyr straits, the eastern edge of Anadyr Bay, and St. Matthew Island. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Balaena mysticetus; Bering sea; Bowhead whale; Kernel density; Satellite telemetry; Shipping lanes","arrival date; home range; human activity; migration; movement; population distribution; satellite imagery; sea ice; shipping; tagging; telemetry; whale; winter; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"(2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment: Scientific Report, p. 1042. , ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Berline, L., Spitz, Y.H., Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Euphausiid transport in the western Arctic Ocean (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 360, pp. 163-178. , doi:10.3354/meps07387; Bessonov, I.B., Melnikov, V.V., Bobkov, V.A., Distribution and Migration of Cetaceans In the Soviet Chukchi Sea (1990) Conference Proceedings, Third Information Transfer Meeting, pp. 21-26. , U.S. Minerals Management Service, Alaska OCS Region; Bickham, J.W., Downing, H.K., Patton, J.C., George, J.C., Suydam, R.S., (2011) Molecular Assessment of Sex Chromosome Polymorphisms In the Bowhead Whale, p. 9. , International Whaling Commission, SC/63/BRG14; Bockstoce, J.R., Botkin, D.B., (1980) The Historical Status and Reduction of the Western Arctic Bowhead Whale (Balaena Mysticetus) Population By the Pelagic Whaling Industry, 1848-1914, , Report of the International Whaling Commission, SC/32/PS16.

The reduced extent and thickness of sea ice and the resultant longer open-water season have major, complex implications for the Arctic marine ecosystem. Increased maritime ship traffic and commercial fishing in the Arctic are bound to affect bowheads and Native (indigenous) hunting communities who depend on whales for subsistence and cultural identity. Bowheads and right whales were greatly depleted by commercial whaling in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Western Arctic bowhead population has been recovering steadily in recent decades, North Atlantic right whales remain highly endangered because of persistent lethal and sublethal vessel strikes and frequent entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Entanglement can be transitory or persistent, with debilitation lasting for months before the animal finally succumbs. Vessel strike and fishing gear trauma has been documented in bowheads, but at a much lower rate than in right whales. Initiatives intended to mitigate the impacts of ship traffic on North Atlantic right whales have included speed limits and routing changes. Those meant to reduce the incidence and severity of entanglements include the modification of gear design and gear deployment practices. Management measures need to be considered in advance in the Arctic in order to minimize the risks to bowhead whales as shipping and industrial fishing expand in the Arctic with ice retreat. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Bowhead whale; Fishing gear entanglement; Ice retreat; Right whale; Vessel strike","commercial activity; fishing; fishing gear; hunting; ice retreat; marine ecosystem; open water; sea ice; shipping; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, WHOI","The following workshop presenters provided thoughtful input: John Adams, Lawson Brigham, Harry Brower, Moira Brown, Ben Ellis, Dan Fitzgerald, Peter Garay, Layla Hughes, Ed Page, Walt Parker, Jan Straley, Angelia Vanderlaan, Janet Whaley, and Bill Wilson.

It is believed to number in the tens. Here we report results from the first satellite transmitter ever deployed on an individual from this stock. A female whale was tagged on 3 April 2010 (at 79°54′ N, 01°03′ E), but no locations were transmitted by the tag until 30 April 2010, after which data were received continuously for 86 days. Additionally, three small clusters of locations were transmitted later in the year; the latest was received 20 December 2010 (262 days after deployment). During the 86 days of continuous tracking, the whale initially remained in the middle of the Fram Strait, between 77°45′ N, 5° W and 80°10′ N, 5° E. For a two-week period starting around 10 June 2010, the whale traveled southwest down to 73°40′ N (at least 950 km). Subsequently it remained at southern latitudes between ~70° and 73° N until the tag stopped continuous transmissions on 24 July. Movement patterns analyzed using first-passage times (FTP), fitted as functions of various environmental variables using Cox Proportional Hazards models, showed that the whale spent most of its time in waters close to the ice edge with modest ice coverage, over areas where the bottom slope was relatively steep. Winter positions (27 November-20 December 2010) revealed that the whale was back in the North at about 80° N. This information, in combination with recent data from passive acoustic listening devices, suggests that the Spitsbergen bowhead stock overwinters at high-latitude locations. The north-south movements of this whale during summer are consistent with the patterns that early whalers described for bowhead whales in this region in the 16th and 17th centuries. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; First-passage time; Habitat use; Satellite tracking","acoustic equipment; endangered species; environmental factor; habitat use; ice cover; movement; overwintering; satellite imagery; tagging; tracking; whale; Arctic; Fram Strait; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Allen, R.C., Keay, I., Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic, 1611-1911: Population reconstruction with historical whaling records (2006) Environment and History, 12, pp. 89-113; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Ford, J.K.B., Heise, K.A., The mixed blessing of echolocation: Differences in sonar use by fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 553-565; Boertmann, D., Nielsen, R.D., A bowhead whale calf observed in northeast Greenland waters (2010) Polar Record, 46, pp. 373-375; Boertmann, D., Merkel, F., Durinck, J., Bowhead whales in East Greenland, summers 2006-2008 (2009) Polar Biology, 32, pp. 1805-1809; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2nd ed.

Examination of species-specific marine mammal calls recorded from autumn 2008-2009 revealed distinctly different acoustic habitats at each site. Overall, the Fram Strait site was acoustically complex compared with the Chukchi Plateau site. In Fram Strait, calls from bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and a variety of toothed whales (odontocetes) were recorded year-round, as were airgun pulses from seismic surveys. In addition, calls from blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) were recorded from June to October and August to March, respectively. Conversely, at the Chukchi Plateau site, beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and bowhead whale calls were recorded primarily from May to August, with airgun signals detected only in September-October. Ribbon seal (Phoca fasciata) calls were detected in October-November, with no marine mammals calls at all recorded from December to February. Of note, ice-adapted bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were recorded at both sites, primarily in spring and summer, corresponding with the mating season for that species. Differences in acoustic habitats between the two sites were related to contrasts in sea ice cover, temperature, patterns of ocean circulation and contributions from anthropogenic noise sources. These data provide a provisional baseline for the comparison of underwater acoustic habitats between Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the High Arctic. © 2011 US Government.","Acoustics; International Polar Year; Marine mammals; Seismic surveys","acoustic method; anthropogenic source; baseline conditions; breeding season; calling behavior; comparative study; habitat quality; human activity; ice cover; marine mammal; mooring system; noise; oceanic circulation; pinniped; sea ice; seismic survey; underwater environment; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Chukchi Plateau; Fram Strait; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Mammalia; Odontoceti; Phoca; Phoca fasciata",,,,,"Norsk Polarinstitutt

We investigate killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation in an ocean system where multiple marine mammal prey coexist. Using stochastic models with Monte-Carlo simulations, we test the most likely outcome of predator selection and compare scenarios where killer whales: (1) focus predation on larger prey which presumably offer more energy per effort, (2) generalize by feeding on prey as encountered during searches, or (3) follow a mixed foraging strategy based on a combination of encounter rate and prey size selection. We test alternative relationships within the Hudson Bay geographic region, where evidence suggests killer whales seasonally concentrate feeding activities on the large-bodied bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). However, model results indicate that killer whales do not show strong prey specialization and instead alternatively feed on narwhal (Monodon monoceros) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales early and late in the ice-free season. Evidence does support the conjecture that during the peak of the open water season, killer whale predation can differ regionally and feeding techniques can focus on bowhead whale prey. The mixed foraging strategy used by killer whales includes seasonal predator specialization and has management and conservation significance since killer whale predation may not be constrained by a regulatory functional response. © 2011 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.","Bowhead whale; Commercial whaling; Functional response; Inuit traditional ecological knowledge; Marine mammals; Monte Carlo model","coexistence; functional change; habitat conservation; Monte Carlo analysis; open water; prey size; size selection; specialization; stochasticity; whale; whaling; Canada; Hudson Bay; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Functional responses of optimal foragers (1982) Am Nat, 120, pp. 382-390; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Occurrence and behavior of transient killer whales-seasonal and pod-specific variability, foraging behavior, and prey handling (1995) Can J Zool, 73, pp. 1300-1311; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Ecological and social determinants of group size in transient killer whales (1996) Behav Ecol, 7, pp. 408-416; Baird, R.W., Whitehead, H., Social organization of mammal-eating killer whales: group stability and dispersal patterns (2000) Can J Zool, 78, pp. 2096-2105; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Matkin, C.O., Durban, J.W., Saulitis, E.L., Ellifrit, D., Predation of gray whales and prolonged feeding on submerged carcasses by transient killer whales at Unimak Island, Alaska (2011) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 421, pp. 229-241; Bergerud, A.T., The reproductive season of Newfoundland caribou (1975) Can J Zool, 53, pp. 1213-1221; Bergerud, A.T., A review of the population dynamics of caribou and wild reindeer in North America (1980) Proc Int Reindeer Caribou Symp, 2, pp. 556-581; Bolnick, D.I., Svanbäck, R., Fordyce, J.A., Yang, L.H., Davis, J.M., Hulsey, C.D., Forister, M.L., The ecology of individuals: incidence and implications of individual specialization (2003) Am Nat, 161, pp. 1-28; Campbell, R.R., Yurick, D.B., Snow, N.B., Predation on narwhals, Monodon monoceros, by killer whales, Orcinus orca, in the eastern Canadian Arctic (1988) Can Field Nat, 102, pp. 689-696; Charnov, E.L., Optimal foraging, the marginal value theorem (1976) Theor Popul Biol, 9, pp. 129-136; Chesson, P., Predator-prey theory and variability (1978) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 9, pp. 323-347; Clark, C.W., Lamberson, R., An economic history and analysis of pelagic whaling (1982) Mar Pollut Bull, 6, pp. 103-120; Condy, P.R., van Aarde, R.J., Bester, M.N., The seasonal occurrence and behaviour of killer whales Orcinus orca, at Marion Island (1978) J Zool, 184, pp. 449-464; Cosens, S.E., Blouw, A., Size and age class segregation of bowhead whales summering in northern Foxe Basin: a photogrammetric analysis (2003) Mar Mammal Sci, 19, pp. 284-296; (2009) COSEWIC assessment and update status report on the Bowhead Whale Balaena mysticetus, , http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/status/status_e.cfm, COSEWIC,Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population and Eastern Canada-West Greenland population, in Canada.

We present an analysis of 42 linked and unlinked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 3 bowhead whale stocks and within the Bering/Chukchi/Beaufort Seas (BCB) stock, and compare results with previously published results of mtDNA control region sequences and 22 microsatellites. We performed tests of population structure (FST, χ2, STRUCTURE), population assignment, and estimates of effective population size (Ne), and evaluated different numbers of loci and samples to estimate the relative statistical power of SNPs and microsatellites. Results indicate that this number of SNPs provides similar power to microsatellites to detect low levels of differentiation (FST = 0.005-0.03) between bowhead populations with sample sizes of at least 20 per population. Neither marker performed well for Bayesian analysis of population structure (STRUCTURE) for the strata that had high diversity coupled with low differentiation. This example is valuable in cautioning against use of STRUCTURE to exclude demographic independence of relatively abundant populations. Microsatellites provided greater precision for estimates of Ne and for assignment tests. All 3 genetic marker types are consistent with the BCB stock being a single population. For microsatellites, differences were found between individuals born before 1949 and those born after 1979. SNPs are continuing to prove valuable as tools for understanding structure and demography of populations, and are likely to prove beneficial for long-term monitoring of bowhead whales. © Inter-Research and Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012.","Balaena mysticetus; Cetacean; Conservation management; Genetic marker; Population genetics; Population structure; SNP","conservation genetics; conservation management; DNA; genetic marker; population genetics; population structure; whale; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA",,"Amend, A., Garbelotto, M., Fang, Z.D., Keeley, S., Isolation by landscape in populations of a prized edible mushroom Tricholoma matsutake (2010) Conserv Genet, 11, pp. 795-802; Amos, W., Marine mammal tissue sample collection and preservation for genetic analyses (1997) Molecular genetics of marine mammals, pp. 107-113. , Dizon AE, Chivers SJ, Perrin WF (eds) Special Publication 3, Society for Marine Mammalogy, Lawrence, KS; Amos, W., Hoffman, J.I., Frodsham, A., Zhang, L., Best, S., Hill, V.S., Automated binning of microsatellite alleles: problems and solutions (2007) Mol Ecol Notes, 7, pp. 10-14; Antao, T., Perez-Figueroa, A., Luikart, G., Early detection of population declines: high power of genetic monitoring using effective population size estimators (2011) Evol Appl, 4, pp. 144-154; Archer, F.I., Martien, K.K., Taylor, B.L., LeDuc, R.G., Ripley, B.J., Givens, G.H., George, J.C., A simulation-based approach to evaluating population structure in non-equilibrial populations (2010) J Cetacean Res Manag, 11, pp. 101-113; Balloux, F., Lugon-Moulin, N., The estimation of population differentiation with microsatellite markers (2002) Mol Ecol, 11, pp. 155-165; Berlin, S., Quintela, M., Hoglund, J., A multilocus assay reveals high nucleotide diversity and limited differentiation among Scandinavian willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) (2008) BMC Genet, 9, p. 89; Brandon, J.R., Wade, P.R., Assessment of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales using Bayesian model averaging (2006) J Cetacean Res Manag, 8, pp. 225-239; Brumfield, R.T., Beerli, P., Nickerson, D.A., Edwards, S.V., The utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms in inferences of population history (2003) Trends Ecol Evol, 18, pp. 249-255; Burns, J.J., Montague, J.J., Cowles, C., (1993) The bowhead whale, , (eds) Society for Marine Mammology, Lawrence, KS Coates BS, Sumerford DV, Miller NJ, Kim KS, Sappington; Coates, B.S., Sumerford, D.V., Miller, N.J., Kim, K.S., Sappington, T.W., Siegfried, B.D., Lewis, L.C., Comparative performance of single nucleotide polymorphism and micro -satellite markers for population genetic analysis (2009) J Hered, 100, pp. 556-564; Davison, A., Chiba, S., Laboratory temperature variation is a previously unrecognized source of genotyping error during capillary electrophoresis (2003) Mol Ecol Notes, 3, pp. 321-323; Dyke, A.S., Hooper, J., Savelle, J.M., A history of sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago based on postglacial remains of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) (1996) Arctic, 49, pp. 235-255; Evanno, G., Regnaut, S., Goudet, J., Detecting the number of clusters of individuals using the software STRUCTURE: a simulation study (2005) Mol Ecol, 14, pp. 2611-2620; Falush, D., Stephens, M., Pritchard, J.K., Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: linked loci and correlated allele frequencies (2003) Genetics, 164, pp. 1567-1587; Finley, K.J., Natural history and conservation of the Greenland whale, or bowhead, in the northwest Atlantic (2001) Arctic, 54, pp. 55-76; Foll, M., Gaggiotti, O., A genome-scan method to identify selected loci appropriate for both dominant and codominant markers: a Bayesian perspective (2008) Genetics, 180, pp. 977-993; Freamo, H., O'Reilly, P., Berg, P.R., Lien, S., Boulding, E.G., Outlier SNPs show more genetic structure between two Bay of Fundy metapopulations of Atlantic salmon than do neutral SNPs (2011) Mol Ecol Resour, 11, pp. 254-267; Gemmell, N.J., Akiyama, S., An efficient method for the extraction of DNA from vertebrate tissues (1996) Trends Genet, 12, pp. 338-339; George, J.C., Bada, J., Zeh, J.E., Scott, L., Brown, S.E., O'Hara, T., Suydam, R.S., Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) via aspartic acid racemization (1999) Can J Zool, 77, pp. 571-580; George, J.C., Zeh, J.E., Suydam, R.S., Clark, C., Abundance and population trend (1978-2001) of western Arctic bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) surveyed near Barrow (2004) Alaska.

In total, 29 recaptures of the same individuals were identified between years, of which 26 individuals were recaptured within the same locality. The remaining 3 were recaptured between sampling localities, from 2 putative International Whaling Commission (IWC) stocks: the Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin stock and the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait stock. These recaptures agree with satellite tracking results that demonstrate movement between IWC stocks and question whether these stocks are true biological entities. The intervals between capture and recapture of females in Disko Bay ranged from 1 to 8 yr. The observed number of multi-year recaptures compared to the expected numbers of recaptures did not indicate any clear cyclicity in the use of Disko Bay consistent with the notion that the migration pattern of females to this area might be tied to their reproductive cycles. A mark-recapture estimate of whales identified in 2010 compared to all identifications between 2000 and 2009 resulted in an estimate of 1410 bowhead whales (SE = 320, 95% CI: 783-2038) constituting the spring aggregation in Disko Bay. The estimate for the female portion of the aggregation was 999 individuals (SE = 231, 95% CI: 546-1452). The multi-year cycle of appearance in Disko Bay emphasizes the necessity for identifying whales over multiple years for inclusion in mark-recapture estimation. © Inter-Research 2011.","Abundance; Balaena mysticetus;

A growth process referred to as ""telescoping"" is partly responsible for this morphology. Here, we explore how changes in facial morphology during fetal growth relate to differences in telescoping between the adult odontocete Stenella attenuata and the mysticete Balaena mysticetus. We conclude that in both Stenella and Balaena head size increases allometrically. Similarly, odontocete nasal length and mysticete mouth size have strong positive allometry compared to total body length. However, the differences between odontocetes and mysticetes in telescoping are not directly associated with their fetal growth patterns.

Data from 117 females determined that 75 were sexually mature and 42 were immature. Estimated length at sexual maturity was 13.35 m. Counts of ovarian corpora were obtained from 50 mature females. Corpora and baleen data were used with aspartic acid racemization (AAR) data to obtain estimated age at sexual maturity (ASM) at 26 years. The number of corpora counted in both ovaries (or estimated when only one ovary was counted) was used with ASM and estimated ovulation rate (OR) to obtain corpora age estimates ranging from 26 to 149 years. A stone harpoon tip recovered from whale 92B2 was consistent with her corpora age of 133 years. The correlation between corpora and AAR age estimates was 0.77. Estimated standard errors of corpora ages tended to be somewhat higher than those for comparable AAR ages. A sample of potentially mature females examined for maturity and presence of a corpus luteum and (or) fetus provided an OR value of 0.332·year -1 and an estimated pregnancy rate of 0.326·year -1, implying intervals between ovulations and pregnancies of 3.0 and 3.1 years.",,"age determination; correlation; data set; error analysis; estimation method; harvesting; indigenous population; pregnancy; reproductive productivity; sexual maturity; whale; Alaska; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Brodie, P.F., Significance of accessory corpora lutea in odontocetes with reference to Delphinapterus leucas (1972) J.

Balaena mysticetus (Bowhead Whale) is the only baleen whale historically known from Hudson Bay, and during the commercial whaling era (18601915), no other large whale was reported to occur there. We note recent (ca. last 10 years) Humpback observations reported by local Inuit hunters in Hudson Bay and northern Foxe Basin. One Humpback was also observed by cetacean biologists in Ungava Bay during an aerial survey for Delphinapterus leucas (Beluga Whales). Minke Whales have previously been reported in southern Hudson Bay and James Bay, and recent discussions with Inuit hunters have indicated possible sightings in Foxe Basin and western Hudson Bay. They are commonly observed by Inuit in eastern Hudson Strait, where there have also been recent detections by biologists. Observations of these species in Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin may be related to reduced ice cover and increased open water, changes in prey species distributions, population recovery and growth following commercial whaling, or some combination of factors. More efficient reporting of observations is needed, and improved community-level monitoring would assist with documentation of temperate-region species in high-latitude areas.",,"Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Abraham, K.F., Lim, B.K., First Minke Whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, record for James Bay (1990) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 104, pp. 304-305; (2006) COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Common Minke Whale Balaenoptera Acutorostrata in Canada, pp. viii+40. , Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) Ottawa, ON, Canada; Crane, R.G., Seasonal variations of sea ice extent in the Davis Strait- Labrador Sea area and relationships with synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation (1979) Arctic, 31 (4), pp. 434-447; Degerbøl, M., Freuchen, P., (1935) Mammals.

Three samples were collected from bowhead whales of the Eastern Canada-West Greenland (EC-WG) population and represent, according to our knowledge, the first diet analysis from this bowhead whale stock. We also examined the stomach content of one bowhead whale from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) population hunted in 1996. All four whales had food in their stomachs and their diet varied from exclusively pelagic (BCB whale), with Limnocalanus macrurus being the main prey, to epibenthic and benthic (EC-WG) with Mysis oculata playing an important role.

We investigated the olfactory anatomy of bowhead whales and found that these whales have a cribriform plate and small, but histologically complex olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb makes up approximately 0.13% of brain weight, unlike odontocetes where this structure is absent. We also determined that 51% of olfactory receptor genes were intact, unlike odontocetes, where this number is less than 25%. This suggests that bowheads have a sense of smell, and we speculate that they may use this to find aggregations of krill on which they feed. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Anatomy; Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Brain; Evolution; Olfaction; Olfactory receptor genes","anatomy; brain; developmental biology; gene expression; histology; olfaction; whale; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea",,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Braund, S.R., Campbell, R.G., George, J.C., Kruse, J., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Spitz, Y., Climate variability, oceanography, bowhead whale distribution and Iñupiat subsistence whaling near Barrow, Alaska Arctic, , In press; Bauchot, R., Les modifications du poids encephalique au cours de la fixation (1967) Journal für Hirnforschung, 9, pp. 253-283; Cajal, S., (1995) Histology of the nervous system of man and the vertebrates.

Some toothed whales can click and whistle simultaneously, and a few studies have also reported simultaneous sound production by baleen whales. The mechanism for sound production in toothed whales has been largely uncovered within the last three decades, whereas mechanism for sound production in baleen whales remains poorly understood. This study provides three lines of evidence from recordings made in 2008 and 2009 in Disko Bay, Western Greenland, strongly indicating that bowhead whales are capable of simultaneous dual frequency sound production. This capability may function to enable more complex singing in an acoustically mediated reproductive advertisement display, as has been suggested for songbirds, and/or have significance in individual recognition. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustics; Balaena mysticetus; Baleen whales; Bowhead whales; Dual frequency; Greenland; Individual recognition; Sound production; Physics",,,,,"A.P.

To address this need for one significant Arctic region, a boat-based marine mammal and seabird transect survey was conducted in Cumberland Sound fjords during summer 2008. During 173 km effort (20 h), 959 birds were recorded representing at least nine species which were dominated by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), Iceland or Glaucous Gulls (Larus glaucoides or Larus hyperboreus), and Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle), in addition to less common birds including Red-throated and Common Loons (Gavia stellata and Gavia immer), Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), and Great or Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus or Larus fuscus). Of these, 480 birds were observed on the water in one event consisting of eiders and gulls which may have biased encounter rates. Of 101 marine mammal sightings, four species were represented: 73 harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), 13 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), nine bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), five ringed seals (Pusa hispida), and one unidentified pinniped. A pod of four killer whales (Orcinus orca) was observed off-effort in Pangnirtung Fjord during the survey period. This pilot study provided the first estimates of relative abundance for marine mammals and seabirds in the study area to aid in developing future surveys. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Abundance; Canadian Arctic; Distribution; Marine mammals; Seabirds; Survey","abundance; baseline conditions; future prospect; pinniped; population distribution; seabird; whale; Baffin Island; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Cumberland Sound; Nunavut; Aves; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cepphus grylle; Delphinapterus leucas; Fulmarus glacialis; Gavia immer; Gavia stellata; Larus fuscus; Larus glaucoides; Larus hyperboreus; Larus marinus; Mammalia; Orcinus orca; Phoca groenlandica; Phoca hispida; Pinnipedia; Somateria mollissima; Somateria mollissima borealis",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC

Ryan's comments on Coltrain et al. (2004) and Coltrain (2009). Both publications present stable isotope data and AMS radiocarbon dates on a suite of eastern Arctic burials from three sites in north-western Hudson Bay. In these articles, we examined the importance of bowhead whaling among Thule foragers at Silimiut and Kamarvik and contrasted their subsistence strategies with those of the proto-historic Sadlermiut, using the stable and radio-isotope chemistry of purified bone collagen to monitor variability in resource acquisition over time. Ryan dismisses a Dorset-era radiocarbon date on a burial collected by Collins from the T-1 site asserting that a single radiocarbon measurement is not a reliable indicator of age and thus the burial is Sadlermiut not Dorset. She also contests our assessment that two historic-era individuals in the Sadlermiut mortuary assemblage were either European or consumed diets relatively high in European foods. Ryan further argues that our reconstruction of protohistoric Sadlermiut diets is not in keeping with the archaeofaunal record. Her primary concern is a perceived lack of agreement between a subset of our findings and the archaeological record. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Dorset; Native Point; Sadlermiut; Stable carbon isotope ratios","Balaena mysticetus; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,,"Ambrose, S.H., Preparation and characterization of bone and tooth collagen for isotopic analysis (1990) Journal of Archaeological Science, 17, pp. 431-451; Arneborg, J., Heinemeier, J., Lynnerup, N., Nielsen, H.L., Rud, N., Sveinbjörnsdóttir, A.E., Change in diet of the Greenland Vikings determined from stable carbon isotope analysis and 14C dating of their bones (1999) Radiocarbon, 41, pp. 157-168; Balasse, M., Tresset, A., Ambrose, S.H., Stable isotope evidence (d13C, d18O) for winter feeding on seaweed by Neolithic sheep of Scotland (2006) Journal of Zoology, 270, pp. 270-276; Collins, H.B., (1955), Native Point and Vicinity, Southampton Island, NWT: List of Skeletal Material Collected during 1954-55 National Museum of Canada/Smithsonian Institution Expedition.

In this chapter we discuss the ecology and shifts in ecosystem structure and energy transfer among trophic levels due to changes in bowhead population size in the Hudson Bay region. Eastern Canadian Arctic bowheads comprise a single large, wide-ranging population that is shared between Canada and West Greenland, with considerable age-and sex-based segregation. In the Hudson Bay region important areas of aggregation include the spring nursery in northern Foxe Basin, summer locations in northwest Hudson Bay, and wintering habitat in Hudson Strait. Bowhead whales have been important for Inuit subsistence for millennia, and were commercially hunted in northwest Hudson Bay from 1860 to 1915. By the time whaling ended bowhead whales had been hunted to low numbers. However the bowhead population has grown in recent decades. We speculate on how rapid changes in northwest Hudson Bay population size, from pristine to depleted and now expanding, may have affected the marine ecosystem. First, bowhead removal would have resulted in a freeing up of zooplankton biomass, with potential cascading effects throughout the food web. Second, with population increases, more bowhead whales are now consuming more zooplankton, creating another ecosystem shift. Third, the region is rapidly losing sea ice due to warming likely resulting in future ecosystem changes. Population growth and warming are now occurring together necessitating a better understanding of bowhead ecology and ecosystem role to inform resource managers and policy makers. With better ecological data and explicit assumptions, detailed ecosystem models could be used to examine changes in ecosystem structure over time and into the future. © 2010 Springer Netherlands.","Commercial whaling; Ecosystem shifts; Food habits; Food web; Inuit traditional ecological knowledge; Killer whale predation; Population growth; Subsistence hunts; Trophic structure; Zooplankton",,,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Clapham, P.J., Modelling the past and future of whales and whaling (2004) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 19, pp. 365-371; Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Hewitt, R., Siniff, D., Trivelpiece, W., Clapham, P., Brownell Jr., R.L., The removal of large whales from the Southern Ocean.

The data were used to (1) characterize the three-dimensional spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the water column, (2) to examine the relationships between whale foraging areas and productive zones, and (3) to examine the correlation between whale-derived in situ values of Chl-a and those from concurrent satellite images using the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EOS-AQUA satellite (MOD21, SeaWifs analogue OC3M and SST MOD37). Bowhead whales traversed 1600 km2, providing information on diving, Chl-a structure and temperature profiles to depths below 200 m. Feeding dives frequently passed through surface waters (&gt;50 m) and targeted depths close to the bottom, and whales did not always target patches of high concentrations of Chl-a in the upper 50 m. Five satellite images were available within the periods whales carried fluorometers. Whales traversed 91 pixels collecting on average 761 s (SD 826) of Chl-a samples per pixel (0-136 m). The depth of the Chl-a maximum ranged widely, from 1 to 66 m. Estimates of Chl-a made from the water-leaving radiance measurements using the OC3M algorithm were highly skewed with most samples estimated as &lt;1 mg m-3 Chl-a, while data collected from whales had a broad distribution with Chl-a reaching &gt;9 mg m-3. The correlation between the satellite-derived and whale-derived Chl-a maxima was poor, a linear fit explained only 10% of the variance. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Bowhead whale; Chlorophyll-a; Fluorometer; MODIS; Remote sensing","algorithm; chlorophyll a; correlation; data set; EOS; fluorometry; marine environment; MODIS; predator; remote sensing; satellite imagery; SeaWiFS; vertical distribution; water column; water temperature; whale; Arctic; Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"Pinngortitaleriffik, GINR","This study was supported by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, National Environmental Research Institute, the US National Science Foundation (KLL), and the Danish Cooperation for the Environment in the Arctic (DANCEA).

Box 32066, Boone, NC 28608, United States","The Iñupiat of Arctic Alaska identify themselves as the ""People of the Whales."" The flesh of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) is high in vitamins and other components that traditionally sustained human physiology in a climate that is unsuitable for agriculture. Not surprisingly, the People of the Whales depend on the bowhead for sustenance and cultural meaning. The bowhead remains central to Iñupiat life and culture through the hunting process, the communal distribution of meat and other body parts, and associated ceremonials and other events to sustain cultural well-being, which I call the Iñupiat whaling cycle. For this study, I coined the term cetaceousness as a hybrid of cetaceous and consciousness, which links human awareness with cetaceans or whales. I use this term to refer to human-whale interactions at all levels. Particularly in Alaska, cetaceousness is a social and emotional process for the Iñupiat to communicate with the whales. Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in Barrow and Point Hope, Alaska, from 2004 through 2007, this study reveals how collective uncertainty about the environment is expressed and managed in Iñupiat practices and, by extension, how deeply global warming penetrates the cultural core of their society. To do so, I illustrate different aspects of Iñupiat-bowhead whale relationships or the ways people make whales a central feature of their lives. By influencing the bowhead harvest and the Iñupiat homeland, climate change increases environmental uncertainties that both threaten and intensify human emotions tied to identity. This emotional intensity is revealed in the prevalence of traditional and newly invented whalerelated events and performances, the number of people involved, the frequency of their involvement, and the verve or feelings with which they participate. Thus, this study investigates how collective uncertainty about the future of the environment would be expressed and managed in Iñupiat practices and, by extension, how deeply climate change penetrates the cultural core of their society. My findings demonstrate how the Iñupiat retain and strengthen their cultural identity to survive unexpected difficulties with an unpredictable environment by reinforcing their relationship with the whales © 2010 by Association of American Geographers.","Adaptation; Arctic Alaska; Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus); Climate change; Cultural identity; Global warming; Humanistic geography; Iñupiat","adaptive management; climate change; cultural identity; ethnic group; global warming; human geography; hunting; nature-society relations; physiology; subsistence; whale; Alaska; Arctic; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,"Earth Institute, Columbia University

From Point Barrow, Alaska, most whales moved west through the Chukchi Sea between 71° and 74° N latitude; nine whales crossed in six to nine days. Three whales returned to Point Barrow for 13 to 33 days, two after traveling 300 km west and one after traveling ∼725 km west to Wrangel Island, Russia; two then crossed the Chukchi Sea again while the other was the only whale to travel south along the Alaskan side of the Chukchi Sea. Seven whales spent from one to 21 days near Wrangel Island before moving south to northern Chukotka. Whales spent an average of 59 days following the Chukotka coast southeastward. Kernel density analysis identified Point Barrow, Wrangel Island, and the northern coast of Chukotka as areas of greater use by bowhead whales that might be important for feeding. All whales traveled through a potential petroleum development area at least once. Most whales crossed the development area in less than a week; however, one whale remained there for 30 days. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Balaena mysticetus; Bowhead whale; Chukchi sea; Fall movements; Habitat use; Kernel density; Migration; Petroleum development; Satellite telemetry","feeding ground; habitat use; movement; oil field; satellite imagery; seasonality; tagging; telemetry; whale; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"(2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , www.acia.uaf.edu, ACIA, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ainana, L., Mymrin, N., Bogoslovskaya, L., Veter, O., (1997) Role of the Eskimo Society of Chukotka in Encouraging Traditional Native Use of Wildlife Resources by Chukotka Natives and in Conducting Shore Based Observations in the Study of Migration Patterns of the Bowhead Whale, Balaena mysticetus, in the Waters of the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea Adjacent to the Chukotka Peninsula (Russia) during January to September, 1996, p. 122. , Report to North Slope Borough from Eskimo Societyof Chukotka, Provideniya, Russia.

Subsistence harvests have an even longer history, and the first culture to be active bowhead whalers was the Thule, which replaced the Dorset culture in the central and eastern Arctic ca 1200 AD. Previous harvest compilations have been incomplete, and back-calculated population models have thus been negatively biased. In recent decades this population has shown significant recovery and is the subject of Inuit subsistence harvests in both Canada and West Greenland. A revised historic abundance estimate is needed to examine the level of recovery; this requires inter alia a revised and updated catch series. Available information from multiple anthropological, archaeological, historic and recent sources, and estimate commercial and subsistence harvests in eastern Canada and West Greenland is summarised. From 1530-1915, commercial whalers took an estimated 55,916-67,537 (median 61,537) bowhead whales (varying assumptions on the intensity of the Basque harvest), which is known to be incomplete. Inuit harvests before commercial whaling began (1200-1529 AD) were estimated at 11,435 whales, based on the abundance of whale bone at winter houses excavated by archaeologists. After 1500 AD, Inuit whaling declined, and the total estimated harvest between 1530 AD and the end of commercial whaling was 8,406 whales. Inuit whaling declined again after commercial whalers overharvested the population and only 65 whales are known to have been harvested (or struck and lost) from 1918-2009. The Inuit harvest statistics are based on scattered data and a number of assumptions, with some evidence that at least parts of the series are underestimated. Even if harvests were higher, they would have probably not been large enough to cause population declines. The long tradition of Inuit bowhead whaling was negatively impacted by commercial harvests. Combining all harvests from 1530-2009 AD results in a total estimated kill of some 70,000 whales (not including struck and lost whales and known gaps for some nations and eras), with most (88%) taken by commercial whalers. Data quality varies considerably by nation and era, and was assigned to a 3-point scale for reliability, with over half the harvest considered to be the least reliable. This is the most comprehensive summary and estimate of bowhead harvests for this region, but is still known to be incomplete and is based on a number of assumptions and disparate data sources.","Arctic ocean; Atlantic ocean; Modelling; Statistics; Whaling - historical; Whaling - revised catches; Whaling -aboriginal","abundance; anthropology; archaeology; catch composition; commercial species; estimation method; functional morphology; habitat restoration; harvesting; population decline; population modeling; population structure; whale; whaling; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Greenland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Strait of Belle Isle; West Greenland; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) represent such a species. Bowhead whales also have a well-documented history of severe commercial harvest in the recent past which would be expected to leave a population out of genetic equilibrium. They also have a very long life span, overlapping generations, and age and sex-structured migrations. In addition, samples come from whales killed in a hunt known to be non-random with respect to size at different whaling villages. Sampling of such a population could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding population structure, which could have real consequences for aboriginal whaling. To better interpret the results of standard population genetic analyses, an individual-based model of bowhead whale population dynamics and genetics was created using the R package rmetasim. The model re-created as closely as possible all aspects of the demography, genetics, and whaling history of bowhead whales. Simulated datasets were generated by sampling from the simulated population in a way that matched the age, sex and geographic distribution of empirically collected samples. The empirical bowhead datasets were compared to null distributions generated from the simulated datasets for a variety of genetic analyses. The analysis indicates that the empirical genetic data sampled from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) stock of bowhead whales are more consistent with the model of a population with the same whaling history and demographic composition as BCB whales than they are with a single, randomly-mating population in genetic equilibrium under a standard Wright-Fisher model. Additionally, it was demonstrated that by failing to account for the unique features of the population dynamics of the species, standard tests of genetic differentiation based on panmixia may produce misleading results. The approach outlined will likely prove useful for evaluating population structure in other species likely to be out of equilibrium.","Age distribution; Arctic; Beaufort sea; Bering sea; Bowhead whale; Chukchi sea; Genetics; Management; Modelling; Northern hemisphere; Whaling - historical; Whaling -Aboriginal","age structure; commercial species; data set; demography; empirical analysis; fishery management; fishery modeling; generation time; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; geographical distribution; harvesting; life history trait; migration; Northern Hemisphere; numerical model; population dynamics; population modeling; sex ratio; whale; whaling; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Fourty-fifth report of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 313-324; Bockstoce, J.R., (1986) Whales, Ice and Men: The History of Whaling in the Western Arctic, , University of Washington Press, Seattle. 400pp; Bockstoce, J.R., Botkin, D.B., The historical status and reduction of the western Arctic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) population by the pelagic whaling industry, 1848-1914 (1983) Rep.

Aerial photographic surveys provide an alternative method for obtaining abundance estimates and may replace ice-based surveys. Aerial photographic surveys were conducted near Point Barrow during the spring migrations of bowhead whales in 2003 and 2004 and, in 2005, in the northern Bering Sea in spring and near Barrow in fall. The 2003 survey was the most complete photographic survey of the population conducted to date. These surveys provided photo-identification data for use in capture-recapture analyses. A screening procedure was used to define which whales captured in 2003, 2004 and/or 2005 were marked and could be reidentified if photographed on another occasion. An estimate of the number of marked whales was obtained using a closed population model for capture-recapture data. Several models were investigated, including models that accounted for heterogeneity in capture probabilities, but a simple model with no covariates produced the most precise estimate. To account for unmarked whales, the estimate of marked whales was divided by an estimate of the proportion of the bowhead population that was marked based on the 1989-2004 spring photographic surveys near Point Barrow. Abundance of the B-C-B bowhead population in 2004 (excluding calves) was estimated to be 12,631 with CV 0.2442,95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval (7,900; 19,700) and 5% lower limit 8,400. These results were compared with results that used approximate variance expressions for the estimates of the number of marked whales, the proportion of the population that was marked and population abundance instead of using the bootstrap. The estimates of abundance in 2004 computed for comparison included one based on a modified Petersen estimate of the number of marked whales that omitted the 2005 data as well as the estimate of 12,631 described above. The comparison estimates also included estimates of abundance in 1985 computed from 1984-87 photographic survey data using the same methods. AU the abundance estimates computed from photographic data were consistent with expectations based on independent abundance and trend estimates from the ice-based surveys conducted from 1978 to 2001.","ABUNDANCE ESTIMATE; ARCTIC; BEAUFORT SEA; BOWHEAD WHALE; MARK-RECAPTURE; PHOTO-ID; SURVEY-AERIAL","abundance; aerial photography; comparative study; data set; estimation method; functional morphology; global warming; heterogeneity; identification method; mark-recapture method; migration; population modeling; survey; whale; Alaska; Arctic; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Point Barrow; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of aerial photogrammetric length measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Fourty-fifth report of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 313-324; Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth-interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback whales (1997) Ecology, 78 (2), pp. 535-546; Best, P.B., Brandão, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J.

We used satellite tracking data from 27 bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus of the Eastern Canada-West Greenland population to test for movement and habitat selection of the highly variable sea ice landscape that encompasses near-complete coverage in winter to nearcomplete absence in summer. We demarcated 2 bowhead whale seasons based on movement behaviour identified from inflection points of polynomial regression analysis of movement rate: winter (28 December to 15 March, 16.6 ± 2.65 km d -1) and summer (27 June to 27 December, 31.9 ± 1.05 km d -1). Resource selection functions were used to evaluate bowhead whale seasonal selection of sea ice landscape (coverage, thickness, and floe size). Movement and habitat use differed between Nunavut tagging sites likely as a consequence of sexual and reproductive segregation. Whales selected relatively low ice coverage, thin ice, and small floe areas in winter close to the maximum ice extent, presumably to reduce risk of ice entrapment while remaining within ice. In contrast, whales selected high ice coverage, thick ice, and large floe size areas in summer, presumably to reduce risk of killer whale predation while providing enriched feeding opportunities. Our results indicate that this largebodied animal can moderate use of the large-scale fluctuations in seasonal sea ice typical of polar environments.

But, only three of these sightings are reported prior to 1980. Most observations involve only one or two whales, but groups of up to seven individuals have been seen recently. Increased ship traffic, particularly cruise-based tourism, in the north undoubtedly provides more opportunities for spotting this species, and the establishment of a structured cetacean sighting programme, as well as increase in effort in documenting sightings from a wider marine user-community, likely all play a role in more records being documented in recent years. The absence of a dedicated monitoring programme for ice-associated cetaceans and the generally low scientific activity level in this field in Svalbard Waters hampers firm conclusions about the trends in abundance of bowhead whales in the Svalbard area. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Balaena mysticetus; Barents Sea; Bowhead whale; Spitsbergen stock; Svalbard","abundance; monitoring system; observational method; sea ice; shipping; stock identification; tourism development; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Norway progress report on cetacean research.

Fifteen species were identified from the subfossil records of which all, except for the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), have also been encountered in the modern times. Fifty-one specimens were radiocarbon dated covering 12 of the subfossil species. The dates fell in three distinct clusters with a few specimens before the last glacial maximum (LGM), a large group between LGM and the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary (ca. 17.0-11.7 cal. kyr BP), and another large group from ca. 8.0 cal. kyr BP onward. Seventeen of the radiocarbon dated specimens have been subjected to trace element analysis by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis. Cross plots of the concentrations of Fe and Zn, and Fe and Co show that it is possible to distinguish crayfish eaters from fish/squid eaters. This can be used as a novel and independent method for the determination to species of whale remains of otherwise uncertain speciation. © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Chronology; Distribution; Late Pleistocene-Holocene; Southern Scandinavia; Species; Trace elements.; Whale remains","bone; cephalopod; chronology; cobalt; concentration (composition); crayfish; feeding behavior; fossil record; iron; Last Glacial Maximum; neutron activation analysis; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; radiocarbon dating; spatial variation; speciation (biology); subfossil; whale; zinc; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Denmark; Kattegat; North Sea; Skagerrak; Astacoidea; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Aaris-Sørensen, K., (1998) Danmarks forhistoriske Dyreverden [The prehistoric fauna of Denmark], , Gyldendal, Copenhagen, Denmark; Aaris-Sørensen, K., Fra istid til nutid (with an English summary: Late and Post Glacial mammals in Denmark) (2007) Dansk Pattedyr Atlas [Atlas of Danish mammals], pp. 312-321. , Baagøe H J, Jensen T S.

Inupiat and Yupik communities in northern and western Alaska hunt these Western Arctic (WA) bowheads along their migratory path during spring and fall. This hunting is regulated by the International Whaling Commission. Recent but preliminary analysis of available genetic data (207 whales and 10 micro- satellite markers) raised the question of the presence of multiple, genetically distinct populations within the WA bowheads. Here we re-examined this question on the basis of a study of 414 whales and 22 newly developed microsatellite loci. We identified widespread departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; however, we were unable to detect significant evidence of multiple genetic populations within the WA bowheads that could explain this Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, particularly when compared to the strength of evidence for differentiation between WA bowheads and other populations from distant regions such as the Okhotsk Sea and eastern Canada. There was conclusive evidence of genetic differentiation among the three regions. The statistical rejection of panmixia within the WA improves our understanding of bowhead whale biology, and the lack of evidence for multiple populations within the WA enables risk-averse management of aboriginal hunting of Western Arctic bowhead whales. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Beaufort; Bering; Bowhead whale; Chukchi; Conservation; Genetic analysis; Genetic bottleneck; Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium; Population differentiation; Population structure; Temporal substructure","genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; nineteenth century; population bottleneck; population structure; whale; whaling; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Bering Sea; Canada; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Archer, F.I., Martien, K.K., Taylor, B.L., LeDuc, R.G., Ripley, B.J., Givens, G.H., George, J.C., A simulation-based approach to evaluating population structure in non-equilibrial populations Journal of Cetacean Research and Management; Bickham, J.W., Hunter, D.D., Matson, C.W., Huebinger, R.M., Patton, J.C., George, J.C., Suydam, R., (2004) Genetic variability of nuclear microsatellite loci in Bering-Chukchi- Beaufort seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus): A test of the genetic bottleneck hypothesis, , Paper sC/56/BRG18 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee, June 2004.

Box 280, King City, Ontario L7B 1A6, Canada","Abundance, mortality, and population growth of bowhead whales (Balaenamysticetus) are estimated from captures of 4,894 putatively different individuals obtained from 10 years of systematic photographic surveys conducted during the spring migration when most of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population of bowheads migrates past Point Barrow, Alaska. A stringent matching protocol designed to prevent false positive matches of the naturally, but variably marked individuals, led to 42 resightings between years. The flip side of this stringency is a presence of false negatives, i. e., some true recaptures are not recognized as such. The problem of false negatives is addressed by modeling the capture process and the matching process. The captures of an individual are assumed to follow a Poisson process with intensity depending stochastically on the individual whale and on the year. The probability of successfully matching a capture to a previous capture is estimated by logistic regression on the degree of marking and image quality. Individuals are recruited by the Pella-Tomlinson population model, and their mortality rate is assumed to be constant. The point estimate of yearly growth rate is 3. 2%, and bowhead abundance in 2001 is estimated to be 8,250, similar to previous estimates. © 2009 International Biometric Society.","Abundance; Bootstrap; Capture-recapture; Confidence curve; Event history; False negatives; Photo-identification","abundance; aerial photography; bootstrapping; capture method; mortality; population estimation; population growth; population migration; survey; whale; Alaska; Point Barrow; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Rugh, D.J., Withrow, D.E., Hobbs, R.C., Evaluations of Aerial Photogrammetric Length Measurements of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas Stock of Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 313-324; Birnbaum, A., Confidence Curves: An Omnibus Technique for Estimation and Testing Statistical Hypotheses (1961) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 56, pp. 246-249; Brandon, J.R., Wade, P.R., Assessment of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas Stock of Bowhead Whales Using Bayesian Model Averaging (2006) The Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 8, pp. 225-239; da-Silva, C.Q., Gomes, P.V.S., Stradioto, M.A., Bayesian Estimation of Survival and Capture Probabilities Using Logit Link and Photoidentification Data (2007) Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 51, pp. 6521-6534; da Silva, C.Q., Zeh, J., Madigan, D., Laake, J., Rugh, D., Baraff, L., Koski, W., Miller, G., Capture-Recapture Estimation of Bowhead Whale Population Size Using Photo-Identification Data (2000) The Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2 (1), pp. 45-61; Davis, R.A., Koski, W.R., Miller, G.W., (1983) Preliminary Assessment of the Length-Frequency Distribution and Gross Annual Recruitment Rate of the Western Arctic Bowhead Whale as Determined With Low-Level Aerial Photography, With Comments on Life History, , Paper SC/35/PS5, presented to International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee; Efron, B., Better Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (1987) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 82, pp. 171-200. , with discussion; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R.J., (1993) An Introduction to the Bootstrap, , London: Chapman & Hall; George, J.C., Philo, L.M., Hazard, K., Withrow, D., Carroll, G.M., Suydam, R., Frequency of Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Attacks and Ship Collisions Based on Scarring on Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas Stock (1994) Arctic, 47, pp. 247-255; George, J.C., Zeh, J., Suydam, R., Clark, C., Abundance and Population Trend (1978-2001) of Western Arctic Bowhead Whales Surveyed Near Barrow, Alaska (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20 (4), pp. 755-773; Koski, W.R., Rugh, D.J., Punt, A.E., Zeh, J., An Approach to Minimise Bias in Estimation of the Length-Frequency Distribution of Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) From Aerial Photogrammetric Data (2006) The Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 8 (1), pp. 45-54; Moore, S.E., Reeves, R.R., Distribution and Movement (1993) The Bowhead Whale, pp. 313-386. , J.

Here, we review existing information about this stock, including much material published in Russian. Whaling for OS bowheads began around 1846, was pursued intensively for two decades and continued sporadically until about 1913. Beginning in 1967, whalers from the USSR killed bowheads illegally, although the number of whales taken remains unknown. Estimates of the pre-exploitation population size have ranged from 3000 to 20000 whales, but all such estimates are based upon untested assumptions and incomplete data. Information on historical and current distribution of bowheads comes from whaling records (notably Townsend 1935) and from modern (notably Russian/Soviet) marine mammal surveys. Little is known about winter distribution. During spring and summer, known bowhead concentrations occur in Shelikhov Bay and at Shantar. Although historical whaling data show bowheads in Shelikhov Bay during summer and early autumn, there have been no recent sightings later than June. However, extensive 19th century catches were made over much of the northern OS, and the present range and habitat use of the population is probably broader than existing data suggest. There is evidence for age or maturational class segregation between Shantar and Shelikhov Bay; the former hosts immature whales and lactating females, and the latter hosts adults. Genetic data indicate that the OS bowhead stock is separate from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population, but that the two populations share a common ancestry. There is no evidence that bowheads ever leave the OS. Russian observers have put the current size of the OS stock in the low hundreds, but this is not based on quantitative analysis. Overall, the OS bowhead population is very likely to be relatively small; it did not recover from the intensive whaling in the 19th century, and the illegal Soviet catches of the 1960s have further set back its recovery. Dedicated surveys and other research are required to assess the status and conservation needs of the population. © 2010 The Authors.

Bowheads recurrently feed on aggregations of zooplankton prey near Barrow in autumn. The mechanisms that form these aggregations, and the associations between whales and oceanography, were investigated using field sampling, retrospective analysis, and traditional knowledge interviews. Oceanographic and aerial surveys were conducted near Barrow during August and September in 2005 and 2006. Multiple water masses were observed, and close coupling between water mass type and biological characteristics was noted. Short-term variability in hydrography was associated with changes in wind speed and direction that profoundly affected plankton taxonomic composition. Aggregations of ca. 50-100 bowhead whales were observed in early September of both years at locations consistent with traditional knowledge. Retrospective analyses of records for 1984-2004 also showed that annual aggregations of whales near Barrow were associated with wind speed and direction. Euphausiids and copepods appear to be upwelled onto the Beaufort Sea shelf during E or SE winds. A favorable feeding environment is produced when these plankton are retained and concentrated on the shelf by the prevailing westward Beaufort Sea shelf currents that converge with the Alaska Coastal Current flowing to the northeast along the eastern edge of Barrow Canyon. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Beaufort Sea; Bowhead whale; Oceanography; Plankton; Subsistence whaling","aerial survey; annual variation; climate variation; hydrographic survey; plankton; traditional knowledge; water mass; whale; whaling; wind direction; wind velocity; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Euphausiidae",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Roach, A.T., Arctic ocean-shelf exchange: Measurements in Barrow Canyon (1990) Journal of Geophysical Research, 95, pp. 18163-18175; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 155-166; Berline, L., Spitz, Y.H., Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Euphausiid transport in the Western Arctic Ocean (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 360, pp. 163-178; Carroll, G.M., George, J.C., Lowry, L.F., Coyle, K.O., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) feeding near Point Barrow, Alaska, during the 1985 spring migration (1987) Arctic, 40, pp. 105-110; Clement, J.L., Maslowski, W., Cooper, L.W., Grebmeier, J.M., Walczowski, W., Ocean circulation and exchanges through the northern Bering Sea: 1979-2001 model results (2005) Deep-Sea Research II, 52, pp. 3509-3540. , doi:10.1016/j. dsr2.2005.09.010; Corwith, H.L., Wheeler, P.A., El Niño related variations in nutrient and chlorophyll distributions off Oregon (2002) Progress in Oceanography, 54, pp. 361-380; Deines, K.L., Backscatter estimation using broadband acoustic Doppler current profilers (1999) Proceedings of the IEEE Sixth Working Conference on Current Measurement, pp. 249-253. , March 1999, doi:10.1109/CCM.1999.755249; Fleischbein, J., Hill, J., Huyer, A., Smith, R.L., Wheeler, P.A., Hydrographic data from the GLOBEC long-term observation program off Oregon, 1997 and 1998 (1999) Data Report 172, Reference 99-1, , Corvallis: Oregon State University; Frost, K.J., Lowry, L.F., Trophic relationships of vertebrate consumers in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (1984) The Alaskan Beaufort Sea, pp. 381-401. , In: Barnes, P.

The longest continuous sampling period from the over-winter survey was 3 October 2003 to 12 May 2004. During that period, bowhead whale calls were recorded from 3 to 23 October, intermittently on 6-7 and 22-23 November, then not again until 25 March 2004. Bowhead calls were recorded almost every hour from 19 April to 12 May 2004, with a call rate peak on 30 April (ca. 9400 calls) and a few instances of patterned calling (or, ""song"") detected in early May. Bowhead whale calls were never detected during the NOAA OE cruise, but calls of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) were recorded at 3 of 16 acoustic stations. Opportunistic visual surveys for marine mammals were also conducted during the NOAA OE cruise from the ship (65 h) and helicopter (7.8 h), resulting in single sightings of bowhead whales (3-5 whales), beluga (16-20 whales), walrus (1), polar bear (2=sow/cub), and 17 sightings of 87 ringed seals from the ship and 15 sightings of 67 ringed seals from the helicopter.","Beaufort Sea; Bioacoustics; Bowhead whale; Chukchi Sea","Acoustic survey; Beaufort sea; Beluga whales; Chukchi Sea; Continuous sampling; Cruise track; Delphinapterus leucas; Marine mammals; Ocean exploration; Polar bears; Ringed seals; Whale calls; Acoustics; Electroacoustic transducers; Helicopters; Mammals; Oceanography; Ships; Surveys; acoustic survey; bioacoustics; calling behavior; hydrophone; seasonal variation; species occurrence; visual analysis; whale; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; United States; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Odobenidae; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus",,,,,,,"Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Welch, H.E., Butler, M., Van Keuren, D., Annual cycle in abundance, distribution, and size in relation to hydrography of important copepod species in the western Arctic Ocean (2003) Deep Sea Research I, 50, pp. 1235-1261; Berline, L., Spitz, Y.H., Ashjian, C.J., Campbell, R.G., Maslowski, W., Moore, S.E., Euphausiid transport in the Western Arctic Ocean (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 360, pp. 163-178; Bockstoce, J.R., Botkin, D.B., The historical status and reduction of the western arctic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) population by the pelagic whaling industry (1983) Report of the International Whaling Commission (Special, pp. 107-141. , 1848-1914, Issue 5, pp; Bogoslovskaya, L., The bowhead whale off Chukotka: integration and scientific and traditional knowledge (2003) Indigenous ways to the present: native whaling in the western Arctic, pp. 209-253. , McCartney A.P.
