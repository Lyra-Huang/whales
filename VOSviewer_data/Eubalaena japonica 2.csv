Despite being the largest animals on the planet, no method currently exists to estimate body mass of free-living whales. We combined aerial photographs and historical catch records to estimate the body mass of free-living right whales (Eubalaena sp.). First, aerial photogrammetry from unmanned aerial vehicles was used to measure the body length, width (lateral distance) and height (dorso-ventral distance) of free-living southern right whales (Eubalaena australis; 48 calves, seven juveniles and 31 lactating females). From these data, body volume was estimated by modelling the whales as a series of infinitely small ellipses. The body girth of the whales was next calculated at three measurement sites (across the pectoral fin, the umbilicus and the anus) and a linear model was developed to predict body volume from the body girth and length data. To obtain a volume-to-mass conversion factor, this model was then used to estimate the body volume of eight lethally caught North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica), for which body mass was measured. This conversion factor was consequently used to predict the body mass of the free-living whales. The cross-sectional body shape (height–width ratio) of the whales was slightly flattened dorso-ventrally at the anterior end of the body, almost circular in the mid region, and significantly flattened in the lateral plane across the posterior half of the body. Compared to a circular cross-sectional model, our body mass model incorporating body length, width and height improved mass estimates by up to 23.6% (mean = 6.1%, SD = 5.27). Our model had a mean error of only 1.6% (SD = 0.012), compared to 9.5% (SD = 7.68) for a simpler body length-to-mass model. The volume-to-mass conversion factor was estimated at 754.63 kg/m3 (SD = 50.03). Predicted body mass estimates were within a close range of existing body mass measurements. We provide a non-invasive method to accurately estimate body mass of free-living whales while accounting for both their structural size (body length) and relative body condition (body width). Our approach can be directly applied to other marine mammals by adjusting the model parameters (body mass model script provided). © 2019 The Authors.

Songs were localized in real-time to individuals using sonobuoys. Singers whose sex could be determined were all males. Autonomous recorder data from 17 year-long deployments were analyzed to document and characterize song types. Four distinct song types were documented over eight years (2009-2017) at five distinct locations. Each song type consists of a hierarchical structure of 1-3 different repeating phrases comprised predominantly of gunshot sounds; three of the four songs contained additional sound types (downsweep, moan, and low-frequency pulsive call). Songs were detected annually (July-January); all song types remained consistent over eight years. Two different songs often occurred simultaneously, produced by different individuals; the same song was never detected simultaneously at the same location. The same song type was detected on the same day and time at two distant locations, indicating multiple individuals can produce the same song. These findings provide support that males produce song; it remains unknown if females also sing. NPRW is the first right whale species documented to produce song. Based on current knowledge about song in mysticetes, it is hypothesized that these songs are reproductive displays. © 2019 U.S. Government.",,"Acoustics; Physics; Bering sea; Eastern north pacific; Hierarchical structures; Low-frequency; North Pacific; On currents; Real time; Right whales; Location",,,,,"International Fund for Animal Welfare, IFAW

All three species (Eubalaena australis, Eubalaena japonica and Eubalaena glacialis) are CITES listed (Appendix I), with the latter two species listed as endangered (IUCN, v 2017-1). The mitochondrial genome of the first two species have been sequenced and are publicly available, while E. glacialis was unavailable. Here we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of E. glacialis, while also detailing a straight forward mitochondrial enrichment method that facilitates analysis using next generation sequencing. This method simultaneously allows for efficient sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, while demonstrating quality sequence coverage that is even across the genome.

Many cultures practice whaling activities, including the Nuu-cha-nulth Nations of the Pacific Northwest. Nuu-cha-nulth cultural lifeways and laws include great care and respect for these animals that provide so much wealth to their communities. The disruption of this culture by colonial governments, combined with the decimation of whale populations through industrial whaling, led to the loss of traditional whaling activities and a gap between contemporary and historical knowledge and practices. From a scientific perspective, knowledge of current whale populations is compromised by lack of data with regards to abundance and distribution of these populations prior to colonial industrial whaling. Analysis of whale bones from First Nation whaling sites are valuable for addressing both these issues by identifying the species landed by communities in traditional hunts, and by providing a sample of the presence and distribution of whale species before colonial industrial whaling. Genetic analyses of 95 bones collected from 7 traditional whaling sites of Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations in the Pacific Northwest were conducted, as well as 11 bones from a colonial industrial whaling site in the area that operated from 1905 to 1918. Specifically, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome-b gene to identify what species were taken, and in what proportions. We found that 45.4% of the bones were from grey whales (Eschrictius robustus), 43.0% were from humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), 8.1% were from North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica), and the remaining 3.5% were from fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). These results reveal catch compositions of historical hunts, and therefore help to inform our understanding of historic practices and preferences, and provide information on which species were present in these areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","First Nation; Genetics; Species identification; Traditional whaling",,,,,,"Clayoquot Biosphere Trust, CBT","We would like to thank the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation for their guidance, involvement, and support of this work at their villages of Echachist and Opitsat, and Diane and Dave Ignace at Hesquait First Nation for their assistance with bones at Hesquait.

This is a major point of concern given the high shipping traffic in this pass. Therefore, a long-term acoustic recorder was deployed in Unimak Pass (2009-2015), and NPRWs were identified using the 'up' and 'gunshot' call types during manual review of data (8188 recorded hours). Calls were grouped into periods of hypothesized migration (Dec-Feb and Mar-May) and other (Jun-Aug and Sep-Nov). Overall, NPRW calling was intermittent and clustered in time, suggestive of a few individuals transiting the area across seasons. Upcalls (n = 31) were detected on 7 d and occurred most often during Dec-Feb, whereas gunshots (n = 465) were detected on 32 d, occurring in all months except February and October. The majority of individual gunshot calls (n = 306) occurred over 3 d in Dec-Feb 2014-15. Because of this pattern, gunshot calling occurred on more days during Jun-Aug, while more individual calls occurred during Dec-Feb. Diel and seasonal trends in hourly call detection rates were absent. Together, these data confirm that NPRW use Unimak Pass both during and outside of the assumed migratory period. Pervasive vessel noise throughout the study highlights near constant potential for interaction with anthropogenic disturbance. Consistently higher vessel noise during Dec-Feb suggests that this species is most vulnerable during the assumed migratory period. © The authors 2018.","Bering Sea; Bioacoustics; Eubalaena japonica; Gulf of Alaska; Passive acoustic; Vessel traffic","Eubalaena japonica",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","We thank the numerous field technicians involved in mooring deployment and retrieval as well as the captains and crews of the FV 'Aquila', FV 'Alaskan Enterprise' and FV 'Mystery Bay'.

Analysis of CUB helps in studying the evolutionary features of a genome. The SRY gene plays an important role in male reproductive organ and a good candidate to study the evolutionary forces, since little work was reported earlier on this gene. We used bioinformatic methods to analyze the protein-coding sequences of SRY gene in 172 different mammalian species to understand the patterns of codon usage and the evolutionary forces acting on it. We found that the codon bias of SRY gene varies widely across mammals. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value revealed that the codons such as TCG, CCG, CAT, ATT, ACT, GCT, GTT, GCG, GGG and GGT were over-represented. Correspondence analysis indicated that the distribution of codons was more close to the axes indicating that compositional constraints might correlate to codon bias. Z-score analysis on RSCU values of codons identified a set of 11 codons viz. TCT, TTT, CTA, CTC, TAT, CAG, CGT, ATA, ACC, AAT and GTA which differed significantly at p < 0.01 between 5% high and low gene expression datasets. Further, it was evident from the neutrality plot that GC12 was influenced by both mutation pressure and natural selection. From the study we concluded that natural selection played a dominant role, but mutational pressure played a minor role in the codon usage pattern of SRY gene across mammals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Codon usage; Mutation pressure; Natural selection; SRY gene","nucleotide; codon; Article; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera brydei; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera physalis; bioinformatics; blue whale; Cercopithecus; Cercopithecus pogonias; Cercopithecus preussi; Cercopithecus solatus; codon usage; correspondence analysis; DNA base composition; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena japonica; gene expression; gene frequency; gene mutation; Megapteran ovaeangliae; minke whale; natural selection; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; priority journal; purifying selection; SRY gene; animal; codon; genetic selection; genetics; mammal; metabolism; molecular evolution; statistical bias; Animals; Bias (Epidemiology); Codon; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, sry; Mammals; Selection, Genetic",,"Codon",,,,,"Sueoka, N., Intrastrand parity rules of DNA base composition and usage biases of synonymous codons (1995) J.

During FFs, impulsive gunshot calls (hereafter 'gunshots'), similar to those produced by other right whale populations, were localized to male and female NPRWs. The timing of gunshots correlated strongly with diving behavior observed during the FFs. Log survivorship analysis of inter-blow intervals showed a bout criterion interval of 40 s, separating the data into shorter surfacings and longer dives. For both, gunshots were skewed closer to the end of the sequence (modal gunshot to blow times: 5 s for dives, 7 s for surfacings) than the beginning (modal blow to gunshot times: 22 s for dives, 13 s for surfacings). Gunshots were more commonly produced during dives than surfacings. Mean gunshot calling rate during FFs was 133.0 calls h-1 (range: 38.9-425.0). Other NPRW calls, including upcalls, the predominant call used to identify right whales acoustically, were not detected during the FFs. To determine comparative call detection rates, an additional 180 h of non-FF recordings were analyzed. Gunshots were detected ~50 times more frequently than upcalls (mean: 228.3 vs. 4.3 calls h-1, respectively), with a maximum gunshot calling rate of 835.7 calls h-1. This is the first study to definitively attribute gunshots to NPRW, and demonstrates the importance of including gunshots in passive acoustic studies, which will greatly increase NPRW detectability while supporting more accurate determinations of their spatio-temporal distribution. © The authors 2017.","Communication; Focal follow; Gunshot call; Passive acoustics; Right whale; Upcall","acoustic wave; communication behavior; endangered species; monitoring; spatiotemporal analysis; survivorship; whale; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"Awbrey, F.T., Thomas, J.A., (1984) Measurements of sound propagation from several acoustic harassment devices, , Final report to National Marine Fisheries Service, PO No. 84-JFA-00062.

The blue whale catches were made between mid-July and mid-September 1972 in the eastern North Pacific at distances of from 96 to 626 nautical miles from the US west coast (Oregon and Washington); they highlight the inadequacy of the International Observer Scheme, as implemented in 1972, to report or detect illegal whaling. These previously unknown blue whale catches bring the Soviet total to 1,638 for the period 1948–1972. The 93 right whale catches were made during the period 1951–62 around the Kuril Islands, which brings the known total of takes of this species from 1935–1971 to 775 (including 10 taken for scientific research and officially reported at the time). © 2017 International Whaling Commission.

Several factors influence present-day insight including the accessibility of the study area and the degree of difficulty in locating and studying target species. The offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska are important habitat to a variety of cetaceans yet have remained largely unsurveyed due to its remote location, vast geographic area, and challenging environmental conditions. Between 2009 and 2015, three vessel surveys were conducted using line-transect sampling methods to estimate cetacean abundance and density. Here, we present results on the distribution for all species encountered and density and abundance for six species, including humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), blue whales (B. musculus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), and Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). Fin whales, humpback whales, and Dall’s porpoise were the most abundant species. Beaked whales were documented only in 2015. Prior to this study, recent sightings of blue whales were rare, likely related to the lack of offshore survey coverage. No North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) were sighted, underscoring the critically endangered status of this species in a formerly populous habitat. Although these results provide the first estimates from offshore waters, additional effort is necessary to assess trends and to obtain baseline data for the rare and cryptic species in order to better inform conservation and management actions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (Outside the USA).",,"abundance; baseline survey; endangered species; line transect; population density; population distribution; porpoise; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; whale; Gulf of Alaska; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena japonica; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Perrin WF, Würsig B, Thewissen JGM, (eds), Academic Press, San Diego; Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) 2nd International symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Petrov BN, Csaki F, (eds), Academiai Kiado, Budapest; Arranz, P., Aguilar Soto, N., Madsen, O.T., Brito, A., Bordes, G., Johnson, M., Following a foraging fish-finder: fine-scale habitat use of deep-diving Blainville’s beaked whales revealed by echolocation (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (12). , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhs1Khu7bK; Baird, R.W., Schorr, G.S., Webster, D.L., Mahaffy, S.D., McSweeney, D.J., Hanson, M.B., Andrews, K.D., Movements of satellite-tagged Cuvier’s and Blainville’s beaked whales in Hawaii: evidence for an offshore population of Blainville’s beaked whales (2009) Report to SWFSC; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

It came close to extinction after nearly a millennium of exploitation and currently persists as a population of only approximately 500 individuals. Setting appropriate conservation targets for this species requires an understanding of its historical population size, as a baseline for measuring levels of depletion and progress toward recovery. This is made difficult by the scarcity of records over this species' long whaling history. We sought to estimate the preexploitation population size of the North Atlantic right whale and understand how this species was distributed across its range. We used a spatially explicit data set on historical catches of North Pacific right whales (NPRWs) (Eubalaena japonica) to model the relationship between right whale relative density and the environment during the summer feeding season. Assuming the 2 right whale species select similar environments, we projected this model to the North Atlantic to predict how the relative abundance of NARWs varied across their range. We calibrated these relative abundances with estimates of the NPRW total prewhaling population size to obtain high and low estimates for the overall NARW population size prior to exploitation. The model predicted 9,075-21,328 right whales in the North Atlantic. The current NARW population is thus <6% of the historical North Atlantic carrying capacity and has enormous potential for recovery. According to the model, in June-September NARWs concentrated in 2 main feeding areas: east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and in the Norwegian Sea. These 2 areas may become important in the future as feeding grounds and may already be used more regularly by this endangered species than is thought. © 2015 Society for Conservation Biology.","caza de ballenas; Eubalaena; feeding grounds; generalized additive modeling; historical baseline; línea base histórica; modelado aditivo generalizado; population size; tamaño de población; whaling; áreas de alimentación","abundance; baseline survey; conservation planning; data set; endangered species; environmental modeling; estimation method; extinction risk; historical record; population size; seasonality; whale; whaling; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; endangered species; environmental protection; population density; population dynamics; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Whales; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Grand Banks; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Norwegian Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,,,,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,,,15231739,,CBIOE,"26632250","English","Conserv.

Many populations remain at low numbers from historical commercial whaling, which had ceased for all but a few by 1989. Fishing gear entanglement and ship strikes are the most severe current threats. The acute and long-term effects of anthropogenic noise and the cumulative effects of multiple stressors are of concern but poorly understood. The looming consequences of climate change and ocean acidification remain difficult to characterize. North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the species listed as Endangered. Southern right, bowhead, and gray whales have been assessed as Least Concern but some subpopulations of these species - western North Pacific gray whales, Chile-Peru right whales, and Svalbard/Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk bowhead whales - remain at low levels and are either Endangered or Critically Endangered. Eastern North Pacific blue whales have reportedly recovered, but Antarctic blue whales remain at about 1% of pre-exploitation levels. Small isolated subspecies or subpopulations, such as northern Indian Ocean blue whales, Arabian Sea humpback whales, and Mediterranean Sea fin whales are threatened while most subpopulations of sei, Bryde's, and Omura's whales are inadequately monitored and difficult to assess. © 2016 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","IUCN; Anthropogenic noise; Baleen whales; Blue whales; Bycatch; Cetaceans; Climate change; Endangered species; Entanglement; Ocean acidification; Red List; Ship strike; Status; Whaling","acidification; bycatch; climate change; commercial species; endangered species; fishing gear; human activity; noise; Red List; subpopulation; subspecies; whale; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Barents Sea; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (North); Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eubalaena japonica; Megaptera; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Aguayo, L.A., Baleen whales off continental Chile (1974) The whale problem: A status report, pp. 209-217. , Pages - in W.

During the past century, there have been only six records of North Pacific right whales off the west coast of Canada. All six were taken by whaling operations, the last in 1951. Results: Two independent and extremely rare sightings of North Pacific right whales were made off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, in 2013. We describe observations made of these two whales and include information on prey and genetic identity for one individual. Conclusions: These sightings represent the first time this species has been confirmed in Canadian waters in 62 years, and likely the only time in the last 15 years that the species has been sighted south of the Kodiak Island area, Alaska, in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. It can be concluded that, although extremely rare, the species has not been extirpated from waters off Canada's Pacific coast. © 2016 The Author(s).","British Columbia; Eubalaena japonica; Neocalanus plumchrus; North Pacific right whale",,,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO","Field work and analyses were funded by the Species at Risk Program of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.","Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology., 215, pp. 403-410; Arndt, U.M., (2011) Ancient DNA Analysis of Northeast Pacific Humpback Whale (Megaptera Novaeangliae), p. 238. , PhD thesis.

Satellite transmitters were deployed on individual right whales in 2004, 2008 and 2009 to investigate whether their space-use patterns in the Southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) were influenced by environmental conditions and to assess habitat use in areas of human interest. Whales were monitored for an average of 40 d (range 29-58 d) between July and October, a period in which they inhabited the SEBS shelf. Individuals tagged in 2008-2009 (cold years) remained in the middle shelf domain, travelled at a slower rate and showed a spatially more restricted habitat use than a whale tagged in 2004 (a warm year). Monte Carlo tests suggested that NPRWs associated with the cold pool (remnant winter water in the bottom layer of the middle shelf domain) during cold years, which is likely due to higher copepod abundance and reduced competition with other copepod predators within the cold pool. Telemetry data indicated that a Critical Habitat designated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service encompasses the main feeding range of NPRWs in the Bering Sea. Two whales briefly visited the North Aleutian Basin, an area previously considered for oil and gas development. Small sample sizes precluded conclusive comparisons of space-use patterns among years with significantly different temperature regimes, but we hypothesize that habitat use in the SEBS varies with these regimes because of concomitant changes in the abundance of the whales primary copepod prey. Long-term evaluation of space-use patterns of NPRWs is required to further understand their habits in the feeding grounds in light of global warming and the potential for increased anthropogenic activities. © 2015 Inter-Research.","Bering Sea; Conservation; Eubalaena japonica; North Pacific right whale; Oceanography; Satellite telemetry","abundance; biomonitoring; biotelemetry; climate change; conservation management; crustacean; endangered species; feeding ground; habitat use; human activity; intraspecific competition; Monte Carlo analysis; predator; satellite data; space use; spatiotemporal analysis; whale; Aleutian Basin; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"(1990) User's Manual, , Argos Service Argos, Landover, MD; Baier, C.T., Napp, J.M., Climate-induced variability in Calanus marshallae populations (2003) J Plankton Res, 25, pp. 771-782; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Baumgartner, M.F., Lysiak, N.S.J., Esch, H.C., Zerbini, A.N., Berchok, C.L., Clapham, P.J., Associations between North Pacific right whales and their zooplanktonic prey in the southeastern Bering Sea (2013) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 490, pp. 267-284; Boyer, T.P., Antonov, J.I., Baranov, O.K., Garcia, H.E., World Ocean Database 2009 (2009) NOAA Atlas NESDIS, 66, p. 216. , S Levitus S (Ed) Government Printing Office, Washington DC; Brownell, Jr.R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (2), pp. 269-286; Ciannelli, L., Bailey, K.M., Landscape dynamics and resulting species interactions: The cod-capelin system in the southeastern Bering Sea (2005) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 291, pp. 227-236; Clapham, P.J., Ivashchenko, Y., A whale of a deception (2009) Mar Fish Rev, 71, pp. 44-52; Clapham, P.J., Good, C., Quinn, S.E., Reeves, R.R., Scarff, J.E., Brownell, Jr.R.L., Distribution of North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) as shown by 19th and 20th century whaling catch and sighting records (2004) J Cetacean Res Manag, 6, pp. 1-6; Coachman, L.K., Circulation, water masses, and fluxes on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf (1986) Cont Shelf Res, 5, pp. 23-108; Cooney, R.T., Coyle, K.O., Trophic implications of cross-shelf copepod distributions in the Southeastern Bering Sea (1982) Mar Biol, 70, pp. 187-196; Coyle, K.O., Chavfur, V.G., Pinchuk, A.I., Zooplankton of the Bering Sea: A review of Russian-language literature (1996) Ecology of the Bering Sea: A Review of Russian-language Literature, , Mathisen OA, Coyle KO (eds) Alaska Sea Grant College Program, Fairbanks, AK; Coyle, K.O., Pinchuk, A.I., Eisner, L.B., Napp, J.M., Zoo-plankton species composition, abundance and biomass on the eastern Bering Sea shelf during summer: The potential role of water-column stability and nutrients in structuring the zooplankton community (2008) Deep-Sea Res II, 55, pp. 1775-1791; Coyle, K.O., Eisner, L.B., Mueter, F.J., Pinchuk, A.I., Climate change in the southeastern Bering Sea: Impacts on pollock stocks and implications for the oscillating control hypothesis (2011) Fish Oceanogr, 20, pp. 139-156; Cressie, N.A.C., (1993) Statistics for Spatial Data (Revised Edition), , Wiley, New York, NY; Danielson, S., Eisner, L., Weingartner, T., Aagaard, K., Thermal and haline variability over the central Bering Sea shelf: Seasonal and interannual perspectives (2011) Cont Shelf Res, 31, pp. 539-554; Doroshenko, N.V., (2000) Soviet Whaling for Blue, Gray, Bow-head, and Right Whales in the North Pacific Ocean, 1961-1979, , Yablokov AV, Zemsky VA (eds).

Previously widespread in the North Atlantic, after centuries of hunting, these whales survive as a small population off eastern North America. Because their exploitation began before formal records started, information about their historical distribution is fragmentary. Location: North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. Methods: We linked historical records of North Pacific right whales (E. japonica; from 19th-century American whaling logbooks) with oceanographic data to generate a species distribution model. Assuming that the two species have similar environmental preferences, the model was projected into the North Atlantic to predict environmental suitability for NARWs. The reliability of these predictions was assessed by comparing the model results with historical and recent records in the North Atlantic. Results: The model predicts suitable environmental conditions over a wide, mostly offshore band across the North Atlantic. Predictions are well supported by historical and recent records, but discrepancies in some areas indicate lower discriminative ability in coastal, shallow-depth areas, suggesting that this model mainly describes the summer offshore distribution of right whales. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the summer range of the NARW consisted of a relatively narrow band (width c. 10° in latitude), extending from the eastern coast of North America to northern Norway, over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, south of Greenland and Iceland, north of the British Isles and in the Norwegian Sea. These results highlight possibilities for additional research both on the history of exploitation and on the current summer distribution of this species. In particular, better survey coverage of historical whaling grounds could help inform conservation efforts for this endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates the challenges and opportunities in using historical data to understand the original distribution of highly depleted species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Eubalaena; Boosted regression trees; Historical distribution; Right whale; Species distribution models; Whaling","endangered species; feeding ground; historical record; hypothesis testing; population distribution; prediction; reliability analysis; summer; whale; whaling; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Greenland; Iceland; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Norway; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Japonica",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 191-199; Allen, J.A., The North Atlantic right whale and its near allies.

Associations among right whales, zooplankton, and the physical environment were examined in the southeastern Bering Sea during the summers of 2008 and 2009. Sampling with nets, an optical plankton counter, and a video plankton recorder in proximity to whales as well as along cross-isobath surveys indicated that the copepod Calanus marshallae is the primary prey of right whales in this region. Acoustic detections of right whales from sonobuoys deployed during the cross-isobath surveys were strongly associated with C. marshallae abundance, and peak abundance estimates of C. marshallae in 2.5 m depth strata near a tagged right whale ranged as high as 106 copepods m-3. The smaller Pseudocalanus spp. was higher in abundance than C. marshallae in proximity to right whales, but significantly lower in biomass. High concentrations of C. marshallae occurred in both the surface and bottom layers of the highly stratified water column, but there was no evidence of diel vertical migration. Instead, occurrence of C. marshallae in the bottom layer was associated with elevated near-bottom light attenuance and chlorophyll fluorescence, suggesting C. marshallae may aggregate at depth while feeding on resuspended phytodetritus. Despite the occasional presence of strong horizontal gradients in hydrographic properties, no association was found between C. marshallae and either fronts or phytoplankton distribution. © Inter-Research 2013.","Baleen whale; Bering sea; Calanus glacialis; Calanus marshallae; Eubalaena japonica; Phytodetritus; Resuspension; Right whale","abundance; biomass; chlorophyll; climate change; feeding; phytodetritus; phytoplankton; predator-prey interaction; sampling; vertical migration; whale; zooplankton; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",,,,,"U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC: M07RG13267

Catch records for Soviet pelagic operations in the Southern Hemisphere (and the northern Indian Ocean) have been largely corrected, but major gaps have remained for the North Pacific. Here, using newly discovered whaling industry reports, corrected figures for Soviet catches in this ocean arc provided. During the period 1948-79, a minimum of 190,183 whales were killed by the USSR in the North Pacific (195,783 if one includes an estimate for sperm whales taken in years for which there arc no true data); of these, only 169,638 were reported to the IWC, a difference of 20,568 whales (26,168 including the sperm whale estimate). Figures were falsified for 8 of 12 hunted species, with some catches over-reported to camouflage takes of illegal species. Revised catch totals (caught vs. reported) arc as follows: blue whale - 1,621 vs. 858; fin whale - 14,167 vs. 15,445; humpback whale - 7,334 vs. 4,680; sperm whale - 153,686 vs. 132,505; sci whale - 7,698 vs. 11,363; North Pacific right whale - 681 vs. 11; bowhead whale - 145 vs. 0; gray whale - 172 vs. 24. Brydc's, minkc, killer and Baird's beaked whale catches were reported correctly. Of all the hunted species, sperm and North Pacific right whales were the most heavily impacted. Major falsifications for sperm whales involved figures for both total catch and sex ratio.","Blue whale; Bowhead whale; Bryde's whale; Fin whale; Gray whale; Humpback whale; Illegal whaling; North pacific; Nothern hemisphere; Revised catches; Right whale; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Whaling-modern","catch statistics; hunting; mortality; sex ratio; species diversity; whale; whaling; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); USSR; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eubalaena japonica; Megaptera; Physeteridae; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"(1960) Promisloviy Otchct 2-oy Dalncvostochnoy Kitoboinoy Flotili Za 1960 God, p. 208P. , [Whaling production report of the 2nd Far Eastern Whaling fleet for 1960].

Three pairs of large and small individuals were identified in the field; genotype analysis indicated that 2 of these could represent mother-offspring pairs; for the third small individual, no sampled female genetically qualified as a potential mother. In aggregate, the population appears to have lost some genetic diversity, though not to the degree of North Atlantic right whales E. glacialis, and males outnumber females 2:1. A comparison of the eastern Pacific samples to a single Russian sample suggested that the 2 populations are isolated to some degree. The effective population size for the eastern North Pacific was calculated to be 11.6 (95% CI: 2.9-75.0), based on the estimated linkage disequilibrium. These results further indicate that this population is at immediate risk of extirpation. © Inter-Research 2012.","Critically endangered species; Eubalaena japonica; Genetics; IUCN red List category; Mammal; Right whales","endangered species; genetic analysis; genetic structure; genetic variation; genotype; mitochondrial DNA; Red List; sex ratio; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",,,,,,,"Brownell Jr., R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J Ce -tacean Res Manag, 2 (SPEC ISSUE), pp. 269-286; Buchanan, F.C., Friesen, M.K., Littlejohn, R.P., Clayton, J.W., Microsatellites from the beluga whale Delphinapterus leucas (1996) Mol Ecol, 5, pp. 571-575; Cornuet, J.M., Piry, S., Luikart, G., Estoup, A., Solignac, M., New methods employing multilocus genotypes to select or exclude populations as origins of individuals (1999) Genetics, 153, pp. 1989-2000; Fain, S.R., LeMay, J.P., Gender identification of humans and mammalian wildlife species from PCR amplified sexlinked genes (1995) Proc Am Acad Forensic Sci, 1, p. 34; Ivashchenko, Y.V., Clapham, P.J., Soviet catches of right whales Eubalaena japonica and bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus in the North Pacific Ocean and Okhotsk Sea (2012) Endang Species Res, , (in press); Kennedy, A.S., Salden, D.R., Clapham, P.J., First high- to low-latitude match of an eastern North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) (2011) Mar Mamm Sci, , doi: 10. 1111/ j.1748-7692.2011.00539.x; LeDuc, R.G., Perryman, W.L., Gilpatrick Jr, J.W., Hyde, J., Stinchcomb, C., Carretta, J.V., Brownell Jr, R.L., A note on recent surveys for right whales in the southeastern Bering Sea (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, (SPEC.

Although over 40 value estimates exist, it is often difficult to compare values from different studies due to variations in study design, implementation, and modeling specifications. We conducted a stated-preference choice experiment to estimate the value of recovering or downlisting 8 threatened and endangered marine species in the United States: loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), upper Willamette River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi), and smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). In May 2009, we surveyed a random sample of U.S. households. We collected data from 8476 households and estimated willingness to pay for recovering and downlisting the 8 species from these data. Respondents were willing to pay for recovering and downlisting threatened and endangered marine taxa. Willingness-to-pay values ranged from $40/household for recovering Puget Sound Chinook salmon to $73/household for recovering the North Pacific right whale. Statistical comparisons among willingness-to-pay values suggest that some taxa are more economically valuable than others, which suggests that the U.S. public's willingness to pay for recovery may vary by species. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Choice experiment; Economics; Marine mammals; Nonmarket valuation; Threatened species; Willingness to pay","comparative study; contingent valuation; data acquisition; endangered species; environmental economics; experimental design; experimental study; household survey; marine environment; marine mammal; rare species; regeneration; teleost; turtle; willingness to pay; adult; animal; aquatic species; article; economics; endangered species; environmental protection; female; human; male; methodology; middle aged; public opinion; questionnaire; socioeconomics; species difference; United States; vertebrate; Adult; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; Questionnaires; Species Specificity; United States; Value of Life; Vertebrates; Young Adult; United States; Caretta; Caretta caretta; Cetacea; Dermochelyidae; Dermochelys coriacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Mammalia; Monachus schauinslandi; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Pristis pectinata; Testudines",,,,,,,"Adamowicz, W., Louviere, J., Swait, J., (1998) Introduction to attribute-based stated choice methods, , Final report.

The evolutionary relationships of balaenids are poorly known, with the number of genera, relationships to fossil taxa, and position within Mysticeti in contention. This study employs a comprehensive set of morphological characters to address aspects of balaenid phylogeny. A sister-group relationship between neobalaenids and balaenids is strongly supported, although this conflicts with molecular evidence, which may be an artifact of long-branch attraction (LBA). Monophyly of Balaenidae is supported, and three major clades are recognized: (1) extinct genus Balaenula, (2) extant and extinct species of the genus Eubalaena, and (3) extant and extinct species of the genus Balaena plus the extinct taxon, Balaenella. The relationships of these clades to one another, as well as to the early Miocene stem balaenid, Morenocetus parvus, remain unresolved. Pliocene taxa, Balaenula astensis and Balaenula balaenopsis, form a clade that is the sister group to the Japanese Pliocene Balaenula sp. Eubalaena glacialis and Pliocene Eubalaena belgica, are in an unresolved polytomy with a clade including E. japonica and E. australis. Extant and fossil species of Balaena form a monophyletic group that is sister group to the Dutch Pliocene Balaenella, although phylogenetic relationships within Balaena remain unresolved. © 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenidae; Fossil whales; Mysticeti; Right whales; Whale evolution; Whale taxonomy","cladistics; fossil record; functional morphology; molecular analysis; Neogene; phylogeny; taxonomy; whale; Balaena; Balaenidae; Belgica; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena japonica; Mysticeti; Neobalaenidae",,,,,,,"Abel, O., Vorläufige mitteilungen uber die revision der fossilen mystacoceten aus dem tertiär belgiens (1941) Bulletin du Musée d'Histoire naturelle de Belgique, 17, pp. 1-29; Allen, J.A., The North Atlantic right whale and its near allies (1908) Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 24, pp. 277-329; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationships of baleen whales established by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Árnason, U., Ledje, C., The use of highly repetitive DNA for resolving cetacean and pinniped phylogenies (1992) Mammal phylogeny: Placentals, pp. 74-80. , Pages - in F.

Since these data lack the concurrent oceanographic data necessary to investigate the species' habitat characteristics I used ocean climate from a 20th century circulation model to create a suitable set of habitat predictors. My goals were to (1) identify regions of suitable habitat and (2) investigate the processes underlying the species-habitat relationship by (3) examining model performance at different spatial and temporal scales. The results show 2 non-overlapping habitat regions in the subarctic North Pacific, supporting the notion of 2 distinct subpopulations. The analysis also implicates surface temperature and temperature variability as strong indicators of potential right whale habitat. Tests of model performance at different scales strongly suggest that at the basin-scale, right whales use regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurs predictably from year to year). The significance of these indicators decreased at the regional scale emphasising the coupling of scale and process, and thus the need for different predictors at different scales. Comparisons of models built using different subsets of the dependent data showed how hypotheses can be tested and potential biases in observational data can be explored. Analyses of rare species' habitat such as this can provide guidance for more directed survey efforts and help identify areas and processes of potential biological importance. © Inter-Research 2011.","Concentration features; Critical habitat; Ecological niche; Habitat processes; Habitat suitability model; Maximum entropy; Pelagic habitat; Presence-only","annual variation; endangered species; habitat quality; habitat selection; habitat structure; hypothesis testing; maximum entropy analysis; niche; observational method; pelagic ecosystem; performance assessment; species diversity; water temperature; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"Amante, C., Eakins, B.W., (2009) ETOPO1 1 arc-minute global relief model: procedures, data sources and analysis, p. 19. , Technical Memorandum NESDIS NGDC-24, NOAA, Boulder, CO; Austin, M.P., Spatial prediction of species distribution: an interface between ecological theory and statistical modelling (2002) Ecol Modell, 157, pp. 101-118; Bakun, A., (1996) Patterns in the ocean: ocean processes and marine population dynamics, , California Sea Grant College System, La Jolla, CA; Baumgartner, M.F., Mayo, C.A., Kenney, R.D., Enormous carnivores, microscopic food, and a restaurant that's hard to find (2007) The urban whale.

Input data were the distances to detected right whale calls, estimated using a normal mode sound propagation model, and call production rate, estimated from encounters by survey vessels with right whale groups. Given the scarcity of information about this highly endangered species, we also extrapolate our results to provide a tentative estimate of the total population size in shelf waters of the eastern Bering Sea. This gives a point estimate of 25 animals (CV 29.1%; 95% confidence interval 13-47), which agrees well with what little is known for this species. We discuss the assumptions underlying the method. Obtaining more reliable values requires a larger sample of randomly located hydrophones, together with improved estimates of call rate. © Inter-Research 2011.","Abundance estimation; Acoustic recording package; Arp; Bering sea; Distance sampling; Harp; High frequency acoustic package; Normal mode propagation; Point transects","abundance estimation; acoustics; endangered species; estimation method; population density; population size; whale; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena japonica",,,,,,,"Amante, C., Eakins, B.W., ETOPO1 1 arc-minute global relief model: procedures, data sources and analysis (2009) NOAA Tech Memo NESDIS NGDC-24, Boulder, CO; Aubauer, R., Lammers, M.O., Au, W.W., One-hydrophone method of estimating distance and depth of phonating dolphins in shallow water (2000) J Acoust Soc Am, 107, pp. 2744-2749; Barlow, J., Taylor, B., Estimates of sperm whale abundance in the northeastern temperate Pacific from a combined acoustic and visual survey (2005) Mar Mamm Sci, 21, pp. 429-445; Borchers, D.L., Marques, T.A., Gunnlaugsson, T., Jupp, P.E., Estimating distance sampling detection functions when distances are measured with errors (2010) J Agric Biol Environ Stat, 15, pp. 346-361; Brownell Jr., R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, 2, pp. 269-286; Buckland, S.T., Point transect surveys for songbirds: robust methodologies (2006) Auk, 123, pp. 345-357; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., Borchers, D.L., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance sampling- estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Cato, D.H., Simple methods of estimating source levels and locations of marine animal sounds (1998) J Acoust Soc Am, 104, pp. 1667-1678; Clapham, P.J., Good, C., Quinn, S.E., Reeves, R.R., Scarff, J.E., Brownell Jr., R.L., Distribution of North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) as shown by 19th and 20th century whaling catch and sighting records (2004) J Cetacean Res Manag, 6, pp. 1-6; Gatz, D.F., Smith, L., The standard error of a weighted mean concentration I (1995) Bootstrapping vs other methods.

Distances to calling animals, needed to estimate source levels, were based on two independent techniques: (1) arrival-time differences on three or more hydrophones and (2) shallow-water dispersion of normal modes on a single receiver. Average root-mean-square (rms) call source levels estimated by the two techniques were 178 and 176 dB re 1 Pa at 1 m, respectively, over the up-call frequency band, which was determined per call and averaged 90 to 170 Hz. Peak-to-peak source levels were 14 to 22 dB greater than rms levels. Transmission loss was approximately 15log10(range), intermediate between cylindrical and spherical spreading. Ambient ocean noise within the up-call band varied from 72 to 91 dB re 1 Pa2Hz. Under average noise conditions, call spectrograms were detectable for whales at distances up to 100 km, but propagation and detection distance may vary depending on environmental parameters and anthropogenic noise. Obtaining distances to animals and acoustic detection range is a step toward using long-term passive acoustic recordings to estimate abundance for this critically endangered whale population. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic detection; Ambient noise; Anthropogenic noise; Bering sea; Critically endangered; Environmental parameter; Noise conditions; Normal modes; North Pacific; Ocean noise; Passive acoustics; Propagation distances; Right whales; Root mean squares; Shallow-water; Source level; Spectrograms; Transmission loss; Animals; Frequency bands; Wave transmission; Acoustic noise; animal; article; endangered species; noise; physiology; population density; sea; signal processing; sound detection; time; vocalization; whale; Animals; Endangered Species; Noise; Oceans and Seas; Population Density; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,"This work was supported by NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center/National Marine Mammal Laboratory (AFSC/NMML) via JIMO Budget No. NA17RJ1231, North Pacific Marine Research Institute (project T-2100) and North Pacific Research Board (projects R-0307 and F0519), and Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG project T-1-6-4).

Today, the species remains extremely rare especially in the eastern North Pacific. Here, we use photographic and genotype data to calculate the first mark-recapture estimates of abundance for right whales in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The estimates were very similar: photographic 5 31 (95% CL 23-54), genotyping 5 28 (95% CL 24-42). We also estimated the population contains eight females (95% CL 7-18) and 20 males (95% CL 17-37). Although these estimates may relate to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger. Its precarious status today-the world's smallest whale population for which an abundance estimate exists-is a direct consequence of uncontrolled and illegal whaling, and highlights the past failure of international management to prevent such abuses.

It is now extremely rare in this region (2 sightings between 1966 and 2003 and passive acoustic detections on 6 days out of 80 months of recordings at 7 locations). From 2004 to 2006, 4 sightings of right whales occurred in the Barnabus Trough region on Albatross Bank, south of Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA. Sightings of right whales occurred at locations within the trough with the highest density of zooplankton, as measured by active acoustic backscatter. Net trawls through a high-density demersal layer (~150 to 175 m) revealed large numbers of euphausiids and oil-rich C5-stage copepods. Photo-identification and genotyping of 2 whales failed to reveal a match to Bering Sea right whales. Fecal hormone metabolite analysis from 1 whale estimated levels consistent with an immature male, indicating either recent reproduction in the Gulf of Alaska or movements between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. Large numbers of historic catches of right whales occurred in pelagic waters of the Gulf of Alaska, but there have been few recent detections in deep water. Given that there is no other location in the Gulf of Alaska where right whales have been repeatedly seen post-exploitation, the Barnabus Trough/Albatross Bank area represents important habitat for the relict population of North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska, and a portion of this area was designated as critical habitat under the US Endangered Species Act in 2006. © Inter-Research 2011.","Eubalaena japonica; Gulf of Alaska; Kodiak Island; North Pacific right whale; Prey; Whaling","Endangered Species Act; exploitation; habitat selection; marine environment; rare species; species conservation; trawling; whale; whaling; Alaska; Bering Sea; Gulf of Alaska; Kodiak Island; Pacific Ocean; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena japonica; Euphausiidae",,,,,,,"Allen, S.E., Vinderinho, C., Thomson, R.E., Foreman, M.G.G., Mackas, D.L., Physical and biological processes over a submarine canyon during an upwelling event (2001) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 58, pp. 671-684; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Brownell Jr., R.L., Clapham, P.J., Miyashita, T., Kasuya, T., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag, 200 (2), pp. 269-286; Brueggeman, J.J., Newby, T., Grotefendt, R.A., Catch records of twenty North Pacific right whales from two Alaska whaling stations, 1917-39 (1986) Arctic, 39, pp. 43-46; Clapham, P., Good, C., Quinn, S., Reeves, R.R., Scarff, J.E., Brownell Jr., R.L., Distribution of North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) as shown by 19th and 20th century whaling catch and sighting records.

From its inception at Monterey, Calif, in the mid 1850's, the shore fishery, involving open boats deployed from land to catch and tow whales for processing, eventually spread from Monterey south to San Diego and Baja California and north to Crescent City near the California-Oregon border. It had declined to a relict industry by the 1880's, although sporadic efforts continued into the early 20th century. The main target species were gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, with the valuable North Pacific right whale, Eubalaena japonica, also pursued opportunistically. Catch data are grossly incomplete for most stations; no logbooks were kept for these operations as they were for high-seas whaling voyages. Even when good information is available on catch levels, usually as number of whales landed or quantity of oil produced, it is rarely broken down by species. Therefore, we devised methods for extrapolation, interpolation, pro rationing, correction, and informed judgment to produce time series of catches. The resulting estimates of landings from 1854 to 1899 are 3,150 (SE = 112) gray whales and 1,637 (SE = 62) humpback whales. The numbers landed should be multiplied by 1.2 to account for hunting loss (i.e. whales harpooned or shot but not recovered and processed).",,"catch statistics; commercial species; time series; whale; whaling; Baja California [(PNN) Mexico]; California; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena japonica; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Alter, S.E., Rynes, E., Palumbi, S.R., The once and future gray whales: DNA evidence for historic population size and ecosystem impacts (2007) Proc.

When given a list of whale species, 39% of the participants incorrectly thought that the humpback whale was the most threatened whale species (blue whale: 24.8%; northern minke whale: 20.9%; gray whale: 10.4%). Only 4.8% correctly chose the North Pacific right whale from the list. Only 23.5% of respondents stated that they had heard of the International Whaling Com-mission (IWC), the international body with responsibility for the management of whale species. However, most of those who were aware of the IWC could cor-rectly state its function. The respondents were also asked what they believed the policy was of the US government with respect to hunting whales: 40% be-lieved that the US government was opposed to all whale hunting; 32.2% stated that only aboriginal whaling was supported; 23.5% stated that the US govern-ment supported sustainable commercial whaling; and 3.9% believed it sup-ported all forms of commercial whaling. A lack of awareness of the conservation status of whales and the US policy towards whaling suggests that greater out-reach to the public, particularly 18-26-year-olds, about the conservation status of whale species is required, by environmental groups and agencies. © ISAZ 2010 PRINTED IN THE UK.","Awareness; Conservation; University students; US policy; Whale; Whaling","conservation status; endangered species; hunting; management practice; policy making; species conservation; species diversity; state role; student; sustainable development; whale; whaling; young population; United States; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eubalaena japonica; Megaptera; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Clapham, P.J., Berggren, P., Childerhouse, S., Friday, N.A., Kasuya, T., Kell, L., Kock, K.-H., Brownell, R.L., Whaling as science (2003) Bioscience, 53, pp. 210-212; Corkeron, P.J., Reconsidering the science of scientific whaling (2009) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 375, pp. 305-309; Eilperin, J., U.S., Japan Negotiate Over Whaling Limits.
