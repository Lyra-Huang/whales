We employed a novel approach combining multi-scale analyses of simultaneous environmental conditions, surface and subsurface humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae movements, and sand lance Ammodytes spp. prey aggregations in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the fine scale (<1 km), digital tags recorded whale movement and behavior in 3 dimensions. Concurrent synoptic prey data were collected using EK60 echosounders with simultaneous surface measurements of temperature and relative fluorescence within 1 km of the tagged whale. A geospatial analysis of environmental features and foraging patterns was conducted at the regional, seascape scale (̃10 km). At the seascape scale, we found: (1) a negative relationship between relative fluorescence and sand lance density; (2) a positive relationship between predator surface feeding, presumed sand lance density, and sand bottom types near high-slope edges; (3) a cyclical relationship for predator surface-feeding likelihood and prey density with tidal height; and (4) an observed temporal lag between peak prey density and predator surface-feeding likelihood. At the fine scale, we found that: (1) time of day was the most important factor in predicting whether a whale was feeding when it surfaced; and (2) surface feeding occurred more often around more dense, vertically distributed schools of prey. Multiscale and multi-trophic level studies are an important component in understanding the foraging ecology of top predators in marine systems. © Inter-Research 2009.","Acoustics; Digital acoustic recording tag;

We tested whether whale watch vessel exposure affected either the calving rates or calf survival to age 2 in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on their feeding grounds off of southern New England, where individually identified whales have been studied intensively for decades and whale watch pressure is intense. Whale watch exposure did not correlate with either the calving rate (# of calves/# of years sighted) or calf production and survival of individual females, although a breakpoint analysis showed a slight negative trend up to 1649 min (or 20 boat interactions). In some comparisons, whales with more exposure were significantly more likely to produce calves and to have those calves survive. Logistic regressions including exposure and prey variables also failed to show negative effects of exposure in predicting calf productivity or survival. A limited comparison of calves seen only in an alternate habitat without whale watching showed similar return rates to those in the exposed area. Our data include limited suggestions that some animals (i.e., females alive when whale watching started) might be more susceptible to impacts than others. However, we found no direct evidence for negative effects of whale watch exposure, and suggest that short-term disturbance may not necessarily be indicative of more meaningful detrimental effects on either individuals or populations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The main target species was the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Study periods varied from 14 to 90 d in duration. Study platforms included a 5-m inflatable boat, a 12-m catamaran, and/or 15-m sailing or motor vessels. Collectively, we obtained 88 individual humpback fluke photographs from this region. These fluke photographs have been compared to over 6,500 individual fluke photographs maintained in the North Atlantic Humpback Whale Catalogue. Based on photoidentification, humpbacks in the Cape Verde Islands have a relatively high interannual resight rate (> 22%) compared to other studied breeding locations in the West Indies. While this is partly due to increased probability of detection in a small population, this result nonetheless suggests strong site fidelity to this breeding ground. Three photo-identified individuals from the Cape Verde Islands had been previously photographed on high-latitude feeding grounds off Bear Island, Norway, and Iceland. One Cape Verdean humpback was resighted in the Azores, possibly en route to the northern feeding grounds. These findings are consistent with the belief that the Cape Verde Islands represent a breeding ground for northeastern Atlantic humpback whales. Tourism activities in the Cape Verde Islands are rapidly increasing. A balance is needed whereby conservation, whale watching guidelines, habitat preservation, and enforcement are fully enacted in order to provide protection to both this species and its habitat. In addition, further research is required to clarify the importance of this small population and its breeding ground.","Breeding grounds; Cape verde islands; Eastern north atlantic; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Photo-identification","breeding site; identification method; population distribution; population size; relative abundance; site fidelity; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Azores; Cape Verde; Portugal; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Berube, M., Øien, N., Robbins, J., Vikingsson, G., Jorgensen, H., Sellas, A., It is not what you know, but what you don't know: Genetic analyses reveal a small unknown eastern North Atlantic breeding population of humpback whales (2009) Abstract of the 18th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, , Quebec, Canada; Berube, M., Rew, M.B., Cole, T., Swartz, S.L., Zolman, E., Øien, N., Genetic identification of an individual humpback whale between the eastern Caribbean and the Norwegian Sea (2004) Marine Mammal Science, 20 (3), pp. 657-663; Brooks, V., Allen, J., Cecchetti, A., Sewall, R., Stevick, P.T., Vikingsson, G., Migration rate of humpback whales feeding off Iceland to the breeding and calving grounds of the West Indies (2009) Abstract of the 18th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, , Quebec, Canada; Camphuysen, C.J., Foraging humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Marsdiep area (Wadden Sea), May 2007 and a review of sightings and strandings in the southern North Sea, 2003-2007 (2007) Lutra, 50 (1), pp. 31-42; Cerchio, S., Estimates of humpback whale abundance off Kauai, 1989-1993: Evaluation biases associated with sampling the Hawaiian Islands breeding assemblage (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 175, pp. 23-34; Charif, R.A., Clapham, P.J., Clark, C.W., Acoustic detections of singing humpback whales in deep waters off the British Isles (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17 (4), pp. 751-768; Christensen, I., Haug, T., Øien, N., Seasonal distribution, exploitation and present abundance of stocks of large baleen whales (Mysticeti) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Norwegian and adjacent waters (1992) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 49 (3), pp. 341-355; Clapham, P.J., Mead, J.G., Megaptera novaeangliae (1999) Mammalian Species, 604, pp. 1-9. , Published by the American Society of Mammalogists; Clapham, P.J., Palsbøll, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Vasquez, O., Composition and dynamics of humpback whale competitive groups in the West Indies (1992) Behaviour, 122, pp. 182-194; Clapham, P.J., Barco, S., Jann, G., Martinez, A., Mattila, D.K., Nelson, M., (2005) Update on a new assessment of North Atlantic humpback whales (Paper SC/57/AWMP9), , Cambridge, UK: Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission; Frantzis, A., Nikolaou, O., Bompar, J.M., Cammedda, A., Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) occurrence in the Mediterranean Sea (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6 (1), pp. 25-28; Friday, N., Smith, T.D., Stevick, P.T., Allen, J., Measurement of photographic quality and individual distinctiveness for the photographic identification of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16 (2), pp. 355-374; Friday, N., Smith, T.D., Stevick, P.T., Allen, J., Fernald, T., Balancing bias and precision in capture-recapture estimates of abundance (2008) Marine Mammal Science, 24 (2), pp. 253-275; Hammond, P.S., Estimating the size of naturally marked whale populations using capture-recapture techniques (SC/37/PS27) (1986) Report of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 253-282. , (Special Issue 8); Hammond, P.S., Heterogeneity in the Gulf of Maine?

However, logistical constraints have largely limited ecological analyses of these interactions. Our objectives were to (1) link humpback whale feeding behaviors to concurrent measurements of prey using scientific echo-sounders, and (2) quantify how sand lance behavior influences the feeding behaviors and foraging ecology of humpback whales. To measure, in fine detail, the 3-dimensional orientation and movement patterns of humpback whales underwater, we used a multi-sensor tag attached via suction cups (DTAG). We tested the specific hypothesis that the diel movement patterns of sand lance between bottom substrate and the water column correlates to changes between surface and bottom feeding strategies of humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, MA. We collected over 96 h of both day- and nighttime data from 15 whales in 2006, and recorded 393 surface and 230 bottom feeding events. Individual whales exhibit both surface and bottom feeding behaviors, switching from one to the other in relation to changing light and prey conditions. Surface feeding behaviors were individually variable in their constitution but ubiquitously biased towards daylight hours, when prey was most abundant in the upper portion of the water column. Bottom feeding behavior occurred largely at night, coincident with when sand lance descend to seek refuge in the substrate. Our data provide novel insights into the behavioral ecology of humpback whales and their prey, indicating significant diel patterns in foraging behaviors concurrent with changes in prey behavior. © Inter-Research 2009.","Diel feeding;

The humpback whale is one of the best known and easily recognizable of the large whales. It is known for its frequent acrobatic behavior and its occasional tendency to approach vessels. At close range, humpback whales are easily distinguished from any other large whale by their remarkably long flippers, which are approximately one-third the length of the body. The flippers are ventrally white and can be either white or black dorsally depending on the population and the individual; the flippers of North Atlantic humpbacks tend to be white, while those in the North Pacific are usually black. Humpback whales are found in all oceans of the world. They are a highly migratory species, spending spring through fall on feeding grounds in mid- or high-latitude waters, and wintering on calving grounds in the tropics, where they do not eat. They are typically found in coastal or shelf waters in summer and close to islands or reef systems in winter. The humpback whale is heavily exploited by the whaling industry for several centuries. Because of its coastal distribution, it is often the first species to be hunted in a newly discovered area. As a result, the humpback is considered as an endangered species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Data were collected on sixteen California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) quarterly cruises (lines 77-93) from July 2004-March 2008.The most frequently sighted large whales were humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, 67 sightings), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus, 52 sightings), and blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus, 36 sightings). Blue and humpback whale sightings peaked in summer (July/August) and fin whales were most frequently seen in summer and fall, consistent with known migratory patterns. In spring through fall, whale sighting locations were associated with colder SST and greater zooplankton abundance levels compared to averages from random locations on the trackline.These results support the hypothesis that foraging distributions of large whales are linked to cold surface temperatures, which may indicate processes that enhance prey production and accumulation, such as upwelling or advection of productive water within the California Current. However, winter distributions of whales presumed to be migrating do not appear to be related to the habitat variables we analyzed, and may be harder to predict based on oceanographic data.The frequency of CalCOFI cruises provides us with high temporal resolution and an ongoing, long time series compared to other survey efforts, allowing comparison between seasons and years that will increase our understanding of these top predators and their response to habitat variability within an important subregion of the California Current Ecosystem.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem (2007) Fish.

As predators, marine mammals feed primarily upon fish, invertebrates, or zooplankton, which in turn feed primarily upon other species of fish, invertebrates, zooplankton, and phytoplankton. To capture their prey, marine mammals have evolved special sensory abilities (e.g., vision and hearing), morphologies (e.g., dentition), and physiologies. They have also evolved specialized strategies to capture prey, such as cooperation to corral fish, or the production of curtains of air bubbles used by humpback whales (. Megaptera novaeangliae) to capture herring. Marine mammals have also evolved specialized feeding behaviors to capture prey that move diurnally up and down the water column or to capture prey that move seasonally across broad geographic ranges. This in turn has likely influenced the life-history strategies of marine mammals and their prey. Marine mammals may also have indirectly influenced the evolution of nontargeted species in their ecosystems by consuming the predators of these species. The best example of this is the apparent influence of sea otters (. Enhydra lutris) on kelp and other marine algae. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A common method is the use of gill nets that hang passively in the water, like curtains, and ensnare fish that blunder into them, or with barriers such as cod traps that direct the fish into traps that hold them until they are removed. Any species can be captured in nets. However, humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, perhaps because of their abundance in coastal waters where nets are commonly used or because of the many barnacles they carry, seem extremely vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear. It was not practical to expect fishermen to stop fishing or to substantially modify where or how they fished. Instead, because cetaceans are acoustic specialists, scientists experimented with electronic devices that could be placed on nets. The hypothesis was that noisier nets would better alert the whales to their presence so they could avoid them. The alarms emitted higher frequency sounds that cetaceans could hear but were not detected by ground fish. Thus, fish catches would not be similarly reduced. Such devices were used successfully in areas where the likelihood of collisions was high. Acoustic alarms reduced collisions by about 80%. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Balaenoptera physalus), killer whales (. Orcinus orca), and sperm whales (. Physeter macrocephalus) in the same area of their brains as spindle cells in human brains. This brain region is linked with social organization, empathy, and intuition about the feelings of others, as well as rapid gut reactions. Spindle cells are important in processing emotions. There is also a growing database showing that fish are sentient beings that experience pain and suffering and that dolphins and other cetaceans are highly intelligent and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain and have remarkable social and cognitive skills. Indeed, dolphins and other marine mammals seem to fulfill some criteria of ersonhood in that they are aware of their surroundings, sentient, and may have a sense of self. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Several feeding aggregations may converge on a common breeding ground for mating and calving. Understanding how feeding and breeding habitats are linked is critical to understanding humpback whale life history and addressing management and conservation efforts. In a continued effort to explore the population structure of North Pacific humpback whales through the analysis of stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N), the present study extends on a previous study of feeding animals to describe migratory linkages to breeding grounds (Witteveen et al. 2009). Skin samples (n = 597) collected from 4 known breeding regions were analyzed for δ13C and δ15N. Breeding regions differed in both δ13C (F3, 585 = 62.3, p &lt; 0.001) and δ15N (F3, 585 = 37.2, p &lt; 0.001). Breeding values reflected the foraging locations for 46 ind. sampled on both habitats; the relationship between the breeding and feeding stable isotope ratios was significant and positive for both δ13C (F 1, 44 = 10.3, r2 = 0.19, p = 0.002) and δ15N (F1, 44 = 40.9, r2 = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, individual breeding and feeding values did not differ for δ15N (t45 = 1.41, p = 0.17) or δ13C (t45 = -1.15, p = 0.26) in pairwise comparisons. We used δ13C and δ15N in a classification tree analysis to describe probable migratory linkages to 6 previously described feeding groups. Stable isotope ratios predicted regional patterns of movement, and assignments of breeding individuals to feeding grounds differed by 12% on average from photographic matching. Our results indicate this technique can be used to help understand the population structure and ecology of North Pacific humpback whale populations, especially when used in combination with other research techniques. © 2009 Inter-Research.","Classification tree analysis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Stable isotopes","breeding site; feeding behavior; isotopic analysis; migratory behavior; population structure; regional pattern; reproductive behavior; stable isotope; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Animalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Aidley, D.J., (1981) Animal Migration, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Alerstam, T., Hedenstrom, A., Akesson, S., Long-distance migration: Evolution and determinants (2003) Oikos, 103, pp. 247-260; Aurioles, D., Koch, P.L., Le Boeuf, B.J., Differences in foraging location of Mexican and California elephant seals: Evidence from stable isotopes in pups (2006) Mar Mamm Sci, 22, pp. 326-338; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 31, pp. 105-119. , and others; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution on mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Baraff, L.S., Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Bowman, R.S., Feeding behaviour of a humpback whale in low latitude waters (1991) Mar Mamm Sci, 7, pp. 197-202; Ben-David, M., McColl, C.J., Boonstra, R., Karels, T.J., N-15 signatures do not reflect body condition in Arctic ground squirrels (1999) Can J Zool, 77, pp. 1373-1378; Berzin, A.A., Rovnin, A.A., The distribution and migrations of whales in the northeastern part of the Pacific, Chukchi and Bering Seas (1966) Izv Tikhookean Nauchno-issled Institut Rybn Khoz Okeanogr, 58, pp. 179-207; Best, P.B., Schell, D.M., Stable isotopes in southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) baleen as indicators of seasonal movements, feeding and growth (1996) Mar Biol, 124, pp. 483-494; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Cubbage, J.C., Balcomb, K.C., Bloedel, P., Biology of humpback whales in the Gulf of Farallones, California (1989) Gulf of Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, , San Francisco, CA; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Evenson, J.R., Photographic identification and abundance estimates of humpback whales off California in 1991-1992 Report No. (1993) Final Report N0ABNF110137, Report to Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, La Jolla, CA; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Evenson, J.R., Flynn, K.R., Interchange and isolation of humpback whales off California and other North Pacific feeding grounds (1996) Mar Mamm Sci, 12, pp. 215-226. , and others; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J., Quinn II, T.J., Abundance and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific Basin (1997) Report to Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, La Jolla, CA, , and others; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Herman, L.M., Cerchio, S., Salden, D.R., Jorge Urban, R., Quinn Ii, T.J., Movements and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17 (4), pp. 769-794; Calambokidis, J., Falcone, E.A., Quinn II, T.J., Burdin, A.M., SPLASH: Structure of populations, levels of abundance and status of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2008) Final report for Contract AB133F-03-RP-00078, , and others U.S. Dept of Commerce Western Administrative Center, Seattle, WA; Cerling, T.E., Wittemyer, G., Rasmussen, H.B., Vollrath, F., Cerling, C.E., Robinson, T.J., Douglas-Hamilton, I., Stable isotopes in elephant hair document migration patterns and diet changes (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 371-373; Cherel, Y., Hobson, K.A., Bailleul, F.R., Groscolas, R., Nutrition, physiology, and stable isotopes: New information from fasting and molting penguins (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2881-2888; Cherel, Y., Phillips, R.A., Hobson, K.A., McGill, R., Stable isotope evidence of diverse species-specific and individual wintering strategies in seabirds (2006) Biol Lett, 2, pp. 301-303; Corkeron, P.J., Connor, R.C., Why do baleen whales migrate?

Shallow outer-blubber samples were obtained from known-age whales from 2 distinct populations (North Atlantic, Gulf of Maine, n = 39; North Pacific, Southeast Alaska, n = 31), and analyzed for their fatty acid (FA) compositions. Multilinear FAage models were derived for these known-age whales, and serve as the basis from which the age of unknown-age whales can be estimated. Four FA-age models were developed; one for each humpback population analyzed separately, and an additional 2 by combining both populations into a single dataset and deriving models based on 'exact' and 'exact' plus 'minimum' known-age whales independently. Each of these empirical models was based on a linear combination of 2 FA ratios rather than individual FA compositions, and shown to be largely independent of sex, diet and nutritional status. Although the precision (σ) of these models was somewhat variable (ranging between 3.1 and 5.3 yr for the specific populations modeled), the results suggest that it may be possible to estimate the age of individual humpback whales from any population with better than decadal resolution using this approach. © Inter-Research 2009.","Ageing; Biopsy sampling; Blubber; Fatty acids; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; North pacific; Northwest atlantic","age determination; age structure; aging; data set; empirical analysis; fatty acid; numerical model; population modeling; sampling; viability; whale; Alaska; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Gulf of Maine; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bannister, J., Best, P., Brownell, R., Clapham, P.J., Kato, H., Calibration of humpback whale earplug readings (2000) J Cetacean Res Manag, 2 (SUPPL.), p. 194; Baraff, L.S., Weinrich, M.T., Separation of humpback whale mothers and calves on a feeding ground in early autumn (1993) Mar Mamm Sci, 9, pp. 431-434; Baraff, L.S., Clapham, P.J., Matilla, D.K., Bowman, R.S., Feeding behavior of a humpback whale in low-latitude waters (1991) Mar Mamm Sci, 7, pp. 197-202; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Smith, T.G., Ellis, G.E., A cetacean biopsy method using lightweight pneumatic darts, and its effect on the behavior of killer whales (1996) Mar Mamm Sci, 12, pp. 14-27; Best, P.B., A note on the age at sexual maturity of humpback whales J Cetacean Res Manage, (SPEC.

Furthermore, these animals are important indicators of the marine ecosystem health, and scientific research is needed to develop appropriate conservation strategies. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of marine mammals in the northern coasts of Veracruz, Mexico. Boat-based surveys and aerial surveys were carried out from March 2005 to August 2006. The following species were observed: bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), spinner dolphin (S. longirostris), rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), and an unidentified species of a dolphin. Also, the remains of a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) were observed. The Margalef Diversity Index showed a value of 1.82 for the entire study area. There were differences in the species sightings across seasons. The abundance for the entire study area was 10,824 (%CV 25.05); the density was 1.45 cetaceans/km2 (%CV 25.05), and the cluster density was 0.71 cetaceans/km2 (%CV 15.25). The dry season showed a relative abundance of 1.98 cetaceans/h; the rainy season, 1.07 cetaceans/h; and the cold front season, 1.28 cetaceans/h. This is a first glimpse of cetacean population sizes in Mexico. Mexican authorities consider all marine mammal species to be under some conservation status, but they do not have population estimates. Supplementary studies will extend the information presented here for further refinement of cetacean diversity and distribution in Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Special effort is needed in deeper waters of the Mexican part of the Gulf of Mexico since there is no information about diversity and abundance of marine mammals for those areas.","Cetacean abundance; Cetacean distribution; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Gulf of Mexico; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus; Stenella attenuata; Stenella longirostris; Steno bredanensis; Tursiops truncatus","abundance; cetacean; conservation status; marine ecosystem; population density; population distribution; population size; species diversity; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Mexico [North America]; North America; Veracruz; Animalia; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella longirostris; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mullin, K.D., May, L.N., Leming, T.D., Cetacean habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico (2001) Fishery Bulletin, 99, pp. 219-239; Biggs, D.C., Leben, R.R., Ortega-Ortiz, J.G., Ship and satellite studies of mesoscale circulation and sperm whale habitats in the northeast Gulf of Mexico during GulfCet II (2000) Gulf of Mexico Science, 18, pp. 15-22; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D., Burnham, K., Laake, J., Borchers, D., Thomas, L., (2001) Introduction to distance and sampling: Estimating abundance of biological populations, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. 350 pp; Davis, R.

During 7 seasons (20002006), a total of 230 research cruises were performed, in which 38 events of interactions among humpback whales and other cetaceans (Tursiops truncatus, Steno bredanensis, Peponocephala electra and Balaenoptera acutorostrata) were observed, plus another 5 encounters without the whale's presence, including T. truncatus, S. bredanensis, P. electra, Stenella clymene and Stenella attenuata.

Their migration routes consist of productive feeding areas located in high-latitudes and to low-latitude areas used as breeding and calving grounds. Genetic studies in humpback whale populations consist mainly of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. In general, these studies provide similar results to estimates of gene flow, but some discrepancies may be caused by gender-biased migration to breeding grounds and further dispersion by males. There is little evidence of trans-equatorial and inter-oceanic migrations, but those movements have been confirmed by both analysis of photo-ID of naturally marked individuals and also genetic analysis. The combination of migratory and genetic analyses suggest an overlapping of breeding grounds in low-latitude areas, where the gene flow among those oceanic populations is more likely to happen, despite the opposite seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. These results have important implications in the conservation perspective, especially for the determination of protected areas and for development of international agreements. © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Feeding and breeding grounds; Gene flow; Humpback whales; Migration routes; Trans-equatorial and inter-oceanic migrations","feeding ground; gender; gene flow; genetic analysis; migration; migration route; mitochondrial DNA; Northern Hemisphere; protected area; Southern Hemisphere; whale; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplo-types in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Population characteristics of DNA fingerprints in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1993) Journal of Heredity, 84, pp. 281-290; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.W., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urban, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae worldwide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Baker, C.S., Population structure of nuclear and mito-chondrial DNA variation among humpback whales in the North Pacific (1998) Molecular Ecology, 7, pp. 695-707; Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine mammals, evolutionary biology. 1st edition, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (1965) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 16, pp. 33-128; Clapham, P., (1996) Humpback Whales. 1st Edition, , Stillwater, MN: Voyageur Press; Clapham, P., (1997) Whales of the World. 1st Edition, , Stillwater, MN: Voyageur Press; Clapham, P., The migration of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (1998) World Marine Mammal Science Conference, , Monaco, Abstract Volume; Clapham, P.J., Mead, J.G., Megaptera novaeangliae (1999) Mammalian Species, 604, pp. 1-9; Craig, A.S., Herman, L.M., Gabriele, C.M., Pack, A.A., Migratory timing of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Central North Pacific varies with age, sex and reproductive status (2003) Behavior, 140, pp. 981-1001; Davies, J.L., The antitropical factor in cetacean speciation (1962) Evolution, 17, pp. 107-116; Dawbin, W.H., The seasonal migratory cycle of humpback whales (1966) Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises, pp. 145-170. , Norris K.S.

This archipelago seems to be an important area for cetaceans, probably due to large concentrations of prey, as well as the existence of several small bays and shallow water that constitute preferred rest areas. In comparison to other areas of the world, little is known about cetacean communities in this archipelago. Boat-based surveys to record sightings of cetaceans were conducted between 2002 and 2005, which represents the first approach to study the occurrence of whales and dolphins in this tropical region. Sightings of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), killer whales (Orcinus orca), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and pilot whales (Globicephala melas) were recorded. Cetaceans were found throughout a range of sea surface temperature between 24 and 29C and a wide range of depths. Significant differences were found regarding the occurrence of some species. Humpback whales showed a preference for shallower waters between 20 and 100m. Bottlenose dolphins occurred most commonly along the continental shelf (20 to 100m) and pantropical spotted dolphins occurred in deep slope waters (>1000m). © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cetaceans; Distribution; Environmental variables; Prncipe; So Tom; Soccurrence","archipelago; biological survey; cetacean; comparative study; concentration (composition); continental shelf; deep water; dolphin; environmental factor; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; species occurrence; tropical region; whale; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Guinea; Sao Tome and Principe; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Globicephala melas; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Budker, P., Collignon, J., Trois campagnes balenieres au Gabon: 1949-1950-1951 (1952) Bulletin de l'Institut d'Etudes Centrafricaines, 3, pp. 75-100; Carvalho, I., (2004) Ocorrencias e comportamentos das baleias corcundas (Megaptera novaeangliae, Borowski, 1781), no sul de S.

We review Soviet catches of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the Southern Ocean during this period, with an emphasis on the International Whaling Commission's Antarctic Management Areas IV, V, and VI (the principal regions of illegal Soviet whaling on this species, south of Australia and western Oceania). Where possible, we summarize legal and illegal Soviet catches by year, Management Area, and factory fleet, and also include information on takes by other nations. Soviet humpback catches between 1947 and 1973 totaled 48,702 and break down as follows: 649 (Area I), 1,412 (Area II), 921 (Area III), 8,779 (Area IV), 22,569 (Area V), and 7,195 (Area VI), with 7,177 catches not currently assignable to area. In all, at least 72,542 humpback whales were killed by all operations (Soviet plus other nations) after World War II in Areas IV (27,201), V (38,146), and VI (7,195). More than one-third of these (25,474 whales, of which 25,192 came from Areas V and VI) were taken in just two seasons, 1959-60 and 1960-61. The impact of these takes, and of those from Area IV in the late 1950's, is evident in the sometimes dramatic declines in catches at shore stations in Australia, New Zealand, and at Norfolk Island. When compared to recent estimates of abundance and initial population size, the large removals from Areas IV and V indicate that the populations in these regions remain well below pre-exploitation levels despite reported strong growth rates off eastern and western Australia. Populations in many areas of Oceania continue to be small, indicating that the catches from Area VI and eastern Area V had long-term impacts on recovery.",,"abundance estimation; coastal zone management; comparative study; crime; population size; whale; whaling; Australasia; Australia; New Zealand; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Berzin, A.

Here we report the presence of Von Economo neurons in the anterior cingulate (ACC), anterior insular (AI), and frontopolar (FP) cortices of small odontocetes, including the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), and the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas). The total number and volume of VENs and the volume of neighboring layer V pyramidal neurons and layer VI fusiform neurons were obtained by using a design-based stereologic approach. Two humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) brains were investigated for comparative purposes as representatives of the suborder Mysticeti. Our results show that the distribution of VENs in these cetacean species is comparable to that reported in humans, great apes, and elephants. The number of VENs in these cetaceans is also comparable to data available from great apes, and stereologic estimates indicate that VEN volume follows in these cetacean species a pattern similar to that in hominids, the VENs being larger than neighboring layer V pyramidal cells and conspicuously larger than fusiform neurons of layer VI. The fact that VENs are found in species representative of both cetacean suborders in addition to hominids and elephants suggests that these particular neurons have appeared convergently in phylogenetically unrelated groups of mammals possibly under the influence of comparable selective pressures that influenced specifically the evolution of cortical domains involved in complex cognitive and social/emotional processes. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cetaceans; Cingulate cortex; Insula; Prefrontal cortex; Stereology; Von Economo neurons","animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; beluga whale; bottlenose dolphin; brain cortex; cell count; cell volume; cellular distribution; Cetacea; cingulate gyrus; female; humpback whale; insula; male; nerve cell; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; species comparison; spindle cell; stereology; Von Economo nerve cell; animal; body weight; brain mapping; comparative study; cytology; dolphin; organ size; physiology; species difference; whale; Animals; Body Weight; Brain Mapping; Cell Count; Cerebral Cortex; Dolphins; Neurons; Organ Size; Pyramidal Cells; Species Specificity; Whales",,,,,,,"Agnarsson, I., May-Collado, L.J., The phylogeny of Cetartiodactyla: The importance of dense taxon sampling, missing data, and the remarkable promise of cytocrome b to provide reliable species-level phylogenies (2008) Mol Phylogenet Evol, 48, pp. 964-985; Allman, J.M., Hakeem, A., Watson, K., Two phylogenetic specializations in the human brain (2002) Neuroscientist, 8, pp. 335-346; Allman, J.M., Watson, K.K., Tetreault, N.A., Hakeem, A.Y., Intuition and autism: A possible role for Von Economo neurons (2005) Trends Cogn Sci, 9, pp. 367-373; Allman, J.M., Tetreault, N.A., Hakeem, A.Y., Kaufman, J.A., Manaye, K.F., Griffiths, H., Semendeferi, K., Hof, P.R., The von Economo neurons in frontoinsular and anterior cingulate cortex in great apes and humans: A comparative and developmental study (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, , in press; Barbas, H., Saha, S., Rempel-Clower, N., Ghashghaei, T., Serial pathways from primate prefrontal cortex to autonomic areas may influence emotional expression (2003) BMC Neurosci, 4, p. 25; Behrmann, G., Cytoarchitectonic studies of the cerebral cortex of the harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (Linné, 1758) (1993) Invest Cetacea, 24, pp. 261-285; Berthoz, S., Armony, J.L., Blair, R.J., Dolan, R.J., An fMRI study of intentional and unintentional (embarrassing) violations of social norms (2002) Brain, 125, pp. 1696-1708; Bertrand, I., (1930) Techniques histologiques de neuropathologie, , Paris: Masson; Boisserie, J.R., Lihoreau, F., Brunet, M., The position of Hippopotamidae within Cetartiodactyla (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 1537-1541; Bromham, L., Phillips, M.J., Penny, D., Growing up with dinosaurs: Molecular dates and the mammalian radiation (1999) Trends Ecol Evol, 14, pp. 113-118; Cavada C, Company T, Tejedor J, Cruz-Rizzolo RJ, Reinoso-Suarez F. 2000.

A suitable collection method and analytical technique using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed. Blow samples were collected opportunistically from free-ranging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 35) and North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (n = 18) using a 13-m carbon fiber pole with a collection device. Samples were analyzed for the presence of testosterone and progesterone using a 55% isocratic gradient with LC-MS. Testosterone was detected in four humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. Progesterone was detected in seven humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. This is the first documented use of lung mucosa to determine the presence of reproductive hormones in any free-swimming cetacean and may provide a novel non-invasive technique to quantify the hormonal condition of free-swimming animals that spend brief periods of time at the water's surface. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Blow; Progesterone; Testosterone; Whale","feasibility study; hormone; identification method; reproduction; steroid; swimming; whale; Animalia; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Atkinson, S., Combelles, C., Vincent, D., Natchigall, P., Pawloski, J., Breese, M., Monitoring of progesterone in captive female false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens (1999) General and Comparative Endocrinology, 115, pp. 323-332. , and; Bressolle, F., Bromet-Petit, M., Audran, M., Validation of liquid chromatographic and gas chromatographic methods: Applications to pharmacokinetics (1996) Journal of Chromatography B, 686, pp. 3-10. , and; Brittebo, E.B., Metabolism of progesterone by the nasal mucosa in mice and rats (1982) Acta Pharmacology and Toxicology (Copenhagen), 51, pp. 441-445; Brittebo, E.B., Localization of oestradiol in the rat nasal mucosa (1985) Acta Pharmacology and Toxicology (Copenhagen), 57, pp. 285-290; Brittebo, E.B., Rafter, J.J., Steroid metabolism by rat nasal mucosa: Studies on progesterone and testosterone (1984) Journal of Steroid Biochemistry, 20, pp. 1147-1151. , and; Chittleborough, R.G., Southern right whale in Australian waters (1956) Journal of Mammalogy, 37, pp. 456-457; Chittleborough, R.G., The breeding cycle of the female humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre) (1958) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 9, pp. 1-18; Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaengliae (Borowski) (1965) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 16, pp. 33-128; Connor, M.L., Sanford, L.M., Howland, B.E., Saliva progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle and late pregnancy (1982) Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, 60, pp. 410-413. , and; Constable, S., Parslow, A., Dutton, G., Rogers, T., Hogg, C., Urinary cortisol sampling: A non-invasive technique for examining cortisol concentrations in the Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddellii (2006) Zoo Biology, 25, pp. 137-144. , and; Cross, N., Pines, M.K., Rogers, L.J., Saliva sampling to assess cortisol levels in unrestrained common marmosets and the effect of behavioral stress (2004) American Journal of Primatology, 62, pp. 107-114. , and; Czekala, N., Sicotte, P., Reproductive monitoring of free-ranging female mountain gorillas by urinary hormone analysis (2000) American Journal of Primatology, 51, pp. 209-215. , and; Czekala, N.M., Robbins, M.M., Assessment of reproduction and stress through hormone analysis in gorillas (2001) Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology, 27, pp. 317-339. , and; Dawbin, W.A., Whale marking in South Pacific waters (1956) The Norwegian Whaling Gazette, 9, pp. 485-508; Dellman, H.D., Eurell, J., (1998) Textbook of Veterinary Histology. 5th Edition., , and.

In this study, we examine the behavioral ontogeny of humpback whale calves during their natal season on the winter breeding grounds. Behavioral data were collected during focal follows for 69 calves. Their relative age was estimated based on the degree of unfurling of the dorsal fin, and analysis of their time budgets revealed that behavior changed as the calves matured. Among the youngest group of calves (n = 27), persistent travel accounted for median 85% (interquartile range 34%) of the calves' time budget, they spent little time alone at the surface and the breathing regime included frequent intermittent breaths. Within the oldest group of calves (n = 26), time spent traveling dropped to a median 47% (IQR 42%) of the time budget, they spent more time at rest, surfaced alone more frequently, and the breathing regime more closely resembled that of adult humpbacks. We suggest potential functions for these and other components of calf behavior during this period, and review our findings in light of recent discussions on the role of predation pressure as a driving force in mysticete migration. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Antipredator behavior; Calf survival and fitness; Humpback whale calves; Megaptera novaeangliae; Ontogeny","antipredator defense; behavior; breeding site; fitness; juvenile; life history; ontogeny; residence time; survival; whale; Hawaii [United States]; North America; United States; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Agrawal, A.F., Brodie, III.E.D., Brown, J., Parent-offspring co-adaptation and the dual genetic control of maternal care (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1710-1712. , and; Altmann, J., Observational studies of behaviour: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Arnould, J., Luque, S., Guinet, C., Costa, D., Kingston, J., Shaffer, S., The comparative energetics and growth strategies of sympatric Antarctic and subantarctic fur seal pups at Iles Crozet (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, 206, pp. 4497-4506. , and; Baird, R.W., McSweeney, D., Bane, J., Barlow, J., Salden, D.R., Antoine, L.K., Leduc, R.G., Webster, D.L., Killer whales in Hawaiian waters: Information on population identity and feeding habits (2006) Pacific Science, 60, pp. 523-530. , and; Beauplet, G., Barbraud, C., Chambellant, M., Guinet, C., Interannual variation in the post-weaning and juvenile survival of subantarctic fur seals: Influence of pup sex, growth rate and oceanographic conditions (2005) Journal of Animal Ecology, 74, pp. 1160-1172. , and; Bekoff, M., Social play behavior (1984) Bioscience, 34, pp. 228-233; Brodie, P.F., Cetacean energetics, an overview of intraspecific size variation (1975) Ecology, 56, pp. 152-161; Burnell, S.R., Bryden, M.M., Coastal residence periods and reproductive timing in southern right whales, Eubalaena australis (1997) Journal of Zoology (London), 241, pp. 613-621. , and; Burns, J.M., Rehberg, M.J., Differences in diving and swimming behavior of pup and juvenile Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska (2008) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 86, pp. 539-553. , and; Burns, J.M., Lestyk, K.C., Folkow, L.P., Hammill, M.O., Blix, A.S., Size and distribution of oxygen stores in harp and hooded seals from birth to maturity (2007) Journal of Comparative Physiology B: Biochemical, Systemic, and Environmental Physiology, 177, pp. 687-700. , and; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Herman, L.M., Cerchio, S., Salden, D.R., Jorge Urban, R., Quinn Ii, T.J., Movements and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17 (4), pp. 769-794; Calambokidis, J., Falcone, E.A., Quinn, T.J., Burdin, A.M., Clapham, P.J., Ford, J.K.B., Gabriele, C.M., Maloney, N., (2008) SPLASH: Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific., p. 57. , and.

Box LG99, Legon, Ghana, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana","The cetaceans of Ghana and the Gulf of Guinea have, until recently, remained unstudied. Periodical monitoring of artisanal fisheries for bycatches in seven Ghanaian artisanal fishing ports and landing sites over 1996-2004 has provided photographic and specimen evidence to validate occurrence of 18 species (17 odontocetes, 1 mysticete) in a tropical, predominantly pelagic cetacean fauna. At least nine species and subspecies had not previously been documented for Ghana (with asterisk), and four species are authenticated for the first time in the Gulf of Guinea (double asterisk), i.e. Tursiops truncatus, Stenella clymene, S. longirostris longirostris*, S. attenuata, S. frontalis, Delphinus capensis capensis*, Lagenodelphis hosei, Steno bredanensis, Grampus griseus, Peponocephala electra*, Feresa attenuata**, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Orcinus orca*, Pseudorca crassidens*, Kogia sima**, Physeter macrocephalus*, Ziphius cavirostris** and Megaptera novaeangliae. Also, the limited published information on distribution, natural history and conservation status is critically reviewed for each taxon. Indications are that most species encountered off Ghana may be widely distributed in the Gulf of Guinea, most notably the long-beaked common dolphin. The vulnerable Atlantic humpback dolphin, Sousa teuszii, remains unrecorded in Ghana and neighbouring nations despite apparently suitable coastal habitat. It is suggested that localized extinction may be blamed, possibly the result of accumulative bycatches and disturbance. A number of other cetacean species not yet encountered could occasionally occur in Ghana's waters, e.g. Balaenoptera brydei, Mesoplodon densirostris, Kogia breviceps, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera brydei; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Feresa attenuata; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Grampus griseus; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenodelphis hosei; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon densirostris; Orcinus orca; Peponocephala electra; Physeter catodon; Pseudorca crassidens; Sousa teuszii; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella clymene; Stenella coeruleoalba; Stenella frontalis; Stenella longirostris longirostris; Steno bredanensis; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Adamec, D., O'brien, J.J., The seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Guinea due to remote forcing (1978) J.

We described the structure of this population using stable isotope analysis of skin samples (n = 1105) collected from free-ranging North Pacific humpback whales from 10 sampling regions in 2004 and 2005. We detected significant quadratic relationships between latitude and both δ13C (R2 = 0.29) and δ15N (R 2 = 0.23) as well as between longitude and δ15C (R2 = 0.43) and δ15N (R2 = 0.16). A weak negative linear relationship was seen between increasing distance from shore and both δ13C (R2 = 0.05) and δ15N (R2 = 0.02). Sampling regions were significantly different for both δ13C (ANOVA, F9,1094 = 136.4, p &lt; 0.001) and δ15N (F9,1095 = 71.5, p &lt; 0.001). We performed classification tree analyses using δ13C and δ15N as predictor variables to assign membership to sampling regions. Results of initial classification and ANOVAs supported combining the 10 sampling regions into 6 feeding groups. When applied to these feeding groups, the classification tree was able to predict 57% of group membership correctly, with accuracy rates for individual groups ranging from a low of 19% to a high of 78%. These results indicate that stable isotope analysis can be used to distinguish unique feeding aggregations of humpback whales within the North Pacific Ocean.

We examined the relation of body size of the NA to the number of attending escorts and, separately, we determined the relation of a female's body size to the size of her calf. Using underwater videogrammetry in Maui waters during 1997-2002, we measured the body length of the NA in each of 42 competitive groups. We also measured the lengths of the mother and her calf in each of 92 mother-calf groups. The number of initial escorts in a competitive group was positively correlated with NA body length. Longer mothers were associated with longer calves, even after accounting for seasonal differences in calf length. We conclude that male humpback whales prefer to associate with larger females and that larger females produce larger calves. Theoretically, larger calves have a greater chance of survival than do smaller calves. The choice of a larger female may therefore increase the reproductive success of an escort that succeeds in mating. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","body size; humpback whale; male choice; Megaptera novaeangliae; videogrammetry","body size; breeding site; mate choice; preference behavior; reproductive strategy; seasonal variation; sperm competition; videography; whale; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Maui; North America; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; United States; Animalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,"The data used in this paper were collected under National Marine Fisheries Service Permit nos 223, 576, 810, 941, 707 and 107 as well as annual State of Hawaii Scientific Permits.

In recent years, the number of humpback whales reported to have been entangled in Alaska has increased. In 2003-04 we quantified the prevalence of non-lethal entanglements of humpback whales in northern Southeast Alaska (SEAK) with the ultimate goal of informing management discussions of the entanglement issue for the Central North Pacific stock of humpback whales. Location : The near-shore waters of northern Southeast Alaska. Methods : We photographed individual humpback whales' caudal peduncles as they dived and then examined the photographs for scars indicative of a previous entanglement. Results : The percentage of whales assessed to have been non-lethally entangled at some time in their lives ranged from 52% (minimal estimate) to 71% (conditional estimate) to 78% (maximal estimate). Of these, the conditional estimate is recommended because it is based solely on unambiguous scars. Eight per cent of the whales in one portion of the study area (Glacier Bay/Icy Strait) acquired new entanglement scars between 2003 and 2004, although the sample size was small. Calves were less likely than older whales to have entanglement scars, and males may be at higher risk than females. Whales with more photographs and/or photographic coverage may be more likely to be assessed as having been entangled than whales with fewer photographs and/or coverage. Main conclusions : Caudal peduncle scars reveal that the majority of humpback whales in northern SEAK have been entangled. Comparison with statistics on reported entanglements suggests that most whales apparently shed the gear on their own, unless humans are disentangling whales much more often than is reported. While cumulative estimates of the percentage of whales with entanglement scars (e.g. the conditional estimate) provide useful baseline information, future efforts should focus on monitoring the annual rate of entanglement scar acquisition as a more powerful measure of contemporary entanglement rates. Our findings indicate that entanglement of humpback whales in fishing gear in SEAK is a management issue warranting increased attention. A proactive approach is needed to address the problem and to identify and implement preventive measures. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bycatch; Endangered species; Entanglement; Fisheries; Humpback whale; Management; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monitoring; Southeast Alaska","bycatch; conservation management; endangered species; fishing gear; injury; monitoring; mortality; photograph; whale; Alaska; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central); United States; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Östman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.T., Lambersten, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Blackmer, A.L., Anderson, S.K., Weinrich, M.T., Temporal variability in features used to photo-identify humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 338-354; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Quinn, T.J., Ii, Herman, L.M., Cerchio, S., Rasmussen, K., (1997) Abundance and Population Structure of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific Basin., , Final Contract Report 50ABNF500113 to.

The Akaike Information Criterion, corrected (AICc) was used as a model comparison statistic. Results : Our best estimate of whale abundance in northern Southeast Alaska in 2000 is 961 whales [95% confidence interval (657, 1076)]. This estimate comes from the Hilborn open, multi-strata approach with constant migration over time, time-dependent capture probabilities by area, and a fixed survival rate of 0.98. The simpler models were problematic owing to several aspects of whale behaviour, including that (1) the whales did not mix randomly throughout the study area, (2) some whales emigrated temporarily outside the study area and were not available for capture, and (3) whales were not equally identifiable because they did not behave in the same way when they showed their flukes upon diving. This led to heterogeneity in capture probability and a bias in the estimates. The more complex models stratified by area, and using migration movements among areas, compensated for some of these issues when estimating population size. Main conclusions : We believe that the Hilborn open, multi-strata model produced the best estimate because: (1) it incorporated the best information about survival, (2) it used detailed information about the various release groups, (3) the analysis provided an integrated environment in which parameters such as migration and capture probabilities are shared, (4) the three strata encompassed a large portion of the areas used by whales, and (5) the Hilborn model selected was superior in terms of model selection criteria and biological realism. These data provide valuable insights into the numbers and movements of humpback whales in three areas of Southeast Alaska. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Abundance; Capture probability; Endangered species; Heterogeneity; Humpback whales; Mark-recapture; Monitoring; Movement; Photo identification; Southeast Alaska","abundance; aggregation behavior; Akaike information criterion; confidence interval; endangered species; feeding behavior; flatfish; heterogeneity; mark-recapture method; movement; photograph; population modeling; population size; survival; whale; Alaska; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Lodge, K.L., (2002) Alaska Marine Mammal Stock Assessments, 2002., , (eds).

Location : The study area included all major inland waters of Southeast Alaska. Methods : Between 1991 and 2007, cetacean surveys were conducted by observers who kept a constant watch when the vessel was underway and recorded all cetaceans encountered. For each species, we examined distributional patterns, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends. Analysis of variance (anovaF) was used to test for differences in group sizes between multiple means, and Student's t-test was used to detect differences between pairwise means. Cetacean seasonal occurrence and annual trends were investigated using a generalized linear model framework. Results : Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were seen throughout the region, with numbers lowest in spring and highest in the fall. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) distributions were more restricted than that reported for humpback whales, and the low number of sightings precluded evaluating seasonal trends. Three killer whale (Orcinus orca) eco-types were documented with distributions occurring throughout inland waters. Seasonal patterns were not detected or could not be evaluated for resident and offshore killer whales, respectively; however, the transient eco-type was more abundant in the summer. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were distributed throughout the region, with more sightings in spring and summer than in fall. Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution was clumped, with concentrations occurring in the Icy Strait/Glacier Bay and Wrangell areas and with no evidence of seasonality. Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) were observed only occasionally, with more sightings in the spring. For most species, group size varied on both an annual and seasonal basis. Main conclusions : Seven cetacean species occupy the inland waters of Southeast Alaska, with distribution, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends varying by species. Future studies that compare spatial and temporal patterns with other features (e.g. oceanography, prey resources) may help in identifying the key factors that support the high density and biodiversity of cetaceans found in this region. An increased understanding of the region's marine ecology is an essential step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of cetaceans in Southeast Alaska. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Annual trends; Cetaceans; Distribution; Group size; Multi-year investigations; Seasonal occurrence; Southeast Alaska","biodiversity; biological survey; cetacean; ecotype; group size; inland sea; marine ecosystem; population distribution; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; species occurrence; variance analysis; zoogeography; Alaska; North America; United States; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., The killer whale - Foraging specializations and group hunting (2000) Cetacean Societies: Field Studies on Dolphins and Whales, pp. 127-153. , ed. by.

Most identified stranding species were sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), followed by short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus). In total, almost half of all stranding events involved unidentified cetaceans, indicating the need of more training on proper procedures of managing stranded whales and dolphins. Yet, despite an insufficient stranding network in the country, there was a well-recorded stranding of a young humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) on 2 and 9 October 2007 in Bali, Indonesia. Colouration of the upper side of the pectoral fin, calf length and time of stranding suggest that the calf belonged to a Southern Hemisphere population, possibly Australia's. The humpback whale stranding in Bali was the one of the first recorded incidences of the species' presence in the Archipelago, hence signifying the importance of a good stranding network in Indonesia. © National University of Singapore.","Bali; Humpback whale; Indonesia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Whale stranding","Cetacea; Delphinidae; Globicephala macrorhynchus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Barnes, R.H., (1996) Sea Hunters of Indonesia: Fishers and Weavers of Lamalera, , Oxford University Press, New York; Blackmer, A.L., Anderson, S.K., Weinrich, M.T., Temporal Variability in Features Used to Photo-Identify Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16 (2), pp. 338-354; Carwardine, M., (2002) Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises, p. 288. , Dorling Kindersley Ltd., New York; Gill, P., Gibson, L., (1997) Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises, p. 160. , Reader's Digest Association, Inc., New York & Montreal; Kahn, B., (2002) Visual and Acoustic Cetacean Surveys and Evaluation of Traditional Whaling Practices, Fisheri Interactions and Nature-based Tourism Potential, p. 36. , Alor and Solor, WWF Indonesia Wallacea Program; Kahn, B., (2004) Indonesia Oceanic Cetacean Program Activity Report: October-December 2003, p. 29. , Apex Environmental, TNC Indonesia; Kahn, B., (2005) Indonesia Oceanic Cetacean Program Activity Report: April-June 2005, p. 31. , Apex Environmental, Cairns; Kreb, D., (2007) Conservation and Diversity of Marine Cetaceans in the Berau Archipelago, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, p. 16. , Technical Progress Report, fieldwork period October 2007.

Acoustic features of song produced by males in breeding wintering areas remain unknown for many breeding sites such as those located in Central America. In other areas, recordings of humpback whale songs in wintering grounds have been used to establish geographical differences among populations. Previous investigations have revealed that geographically isolated populations produce distinctive songs. This study represents the first efforts to record and analyze songs from the Southeastern Pacific stock of M. novaeangliae in the tropical wintering grounds off Central America. The aim of this study was to characterize underwater sounds of whales recorded in Las Perlas Archipelago, Panama. The acoustical structure of the themes for years 2006 and 2007 was typical of songs recorded in other wintering areas. As a result of this analysis, Las Perlas Archipelago should be identified as a critical area for breeding humpback whales.","Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Panama; Songs; Southeast pacific stock","bioacoustics; breeding site; reproductive behavior; song; whale; Central America; Panama [Central America]; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Arraut, E.M., Vielliard, J.M.E., The song of the Brazilian humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the year 2000: Individual song variation and possible implications (2004) Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências, 76 (2), pp. 373-380; Cato, D.H., Songs of humpback whales: The Australian perspective (1991) Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, 30, pp. 277-290; Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Humpback whale songs as indicators of migration routes (1990) Marine Mammal Science, 6 (2), pp. 155-160; Flórez-González, L., Ávila, I.C., Alzueta, J.C., Falk, F.P., Félix, F., Gibbons, J., (2007) Estrategia para la conservación de la ballena jorobada del Pacífico Sudeste: Lineamientos de un plan de acción regional e iniciativas nacionales, p. 106. , [Strategy for the conservation of the humpback whale of the Southeast Pacific: Guidelines for a regional action plan and national initiatives].

Morphological specializations of marine mammals afford mechanisms for passive flow control. Aside from the design of the body, which minimizes drag, the morphology of the appendages provides hydrodynamic advantages with respect to drag, lift, thrust, and stall. The flukes of cetaceans and sirenians and flippers of pinnipeds possess geometries with flexibility, which enhance thrust production for high efficiency swimming. The pectoral flippers provide hydrodynamic lift for maneuvering. The design of the flippers is constrained by performance associated with stall. Delay of stall can be accomplished passively by modification of the flipper leading edge. Such a design is exhibited by the leading edge tubercles on the flippers of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). These novel morphological structures induce a spanwise flow field of separated vortices alternating with regions of accelerated flow. The coupled flow regions maintain areas of attached flow and delay stall to high angles of attack. The delay of stall permits enhanced turning performance with respect to both agility and maneuverability. The morphological features of marine mammals for flow control can be utilized in the biomimetic design of engineered structures for increased power production and increased efficiency. © The Author 2008.

Having evolved over tens of millions of years to cope with the underwater acoustic environment, cetaceans may have developed extraordinary techniques from which we could learn. This paper outlines some of the possible interactions, ranging from the exploitation of acoustics by humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in bubble nets to trap prey, to techniques by which coastal dolphins (e.g. of the genus Cephalorhynchus) could successfully echolocate in bubbly water (a hypothesis which has led to the development of a man-made sonar which can penetrate bubble clouds, and a range of possibilities for homeland security.).",,"Acoustic environment; Bubble cloud; Home land security; Humpback whales; Naturally occurring; Underwater acoustics; Acoustic noise",,,,,,,"Leighton, T.G., Richards, S.D., White, P.R., Trapped within a 'wall of sound': A possible mechanism for the bubble nets of humpback whales (2004) Acoustics Bulletin, 29, pp. 24-29; Leighton, T.G., From seas to surgeries, from babbling brooks to baby scans: The acoustics of gas bubbles in liquids (2004) Int.

Song elements were defined by units following the protocol of previous description of bowhead whale song. The two most prominent songs were loud, complex, and repeated in long bouts on multiple recording days while the third song was much simpler and recorded on only one day. Bowhead whale simple calls and faint song elements were also recorded using digital audio tape recorders and a dipping hydrophone deployed from the sea ice approximately 100-150 km southwest of Disko Bay on three separate days suggesting that song is also produced in the central portion of Baffin Bay in winter. Songs recorded in Disko Bay are from an area where approximately 85% of the whales have been determined to be adult females. Although it is not known which sex was singing, we speculate that, as in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), male bowhead whales may sing to mediate sexual competition or mate selection behaviors.

Four cetacean species are newly reported hosts for Xenobalanus: Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). Sightings of Xenobalanus in pelagic waters are reported for the first time, and concentrations were located within three productive zones: near the Baja California peninsula, the Costa Rica Dome and waters extending west along the 10° N Thermocline Ridge, and near Peru and the Galapagos Archipelago. Greatest prevalence was observed on blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) indicating that slow swim speeds are not necessary for effective barnacle settlement. Overall, prevalence and prevalence per sighting were generally lower than previously reported. The number of barnacles present on an individual whale was greatest for killer whales, indicating that Xenobalanus larvae may be patchily distributed. The broad geographic distribution and large number of cetacean hosts, indicate an extremely cosmopolitan distribution. A better understanding of the biology of Xenobalanus is needed before this species can be used as a biological tag.",,"Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Delphinus capensis; Delphinus delphis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella longirostris; Thoracica; Xenobalanus; Xenobalanus globicipitis",,,,,,,"Addink, M.J., Smeenk, C., Opportunistic feeding behavior of rough-toothed dolphins Steno bredanensis off Mauritania (2001) Zool.

It is included in the large sanctuary for the Indian Ocean whales and due to its remote location is difficult to access. Few scientific investigations on marine mammals have been conducted here and we consequently still have a poor understanding of their dynamics and diversity. In the current study we report on marine mammal sightings that have been collected for the period 1973-2007 by field workers based at the Aldabra research station. These sightings were largely opportunistic and were both shore- and boat-based. In order to assess the diversity of marine mammals, either resident or transient, in Aldabra waters we compiled and quantified these records. Over the study period, 14 species of marine mammals have been reported (n=348 sightings). Among the more numerous sightings have been humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, n=215), which are commonly seen during the months July-to-November and spinner dolphins that are seen year round. Throughout the study period, dugongs (Dugong dugon, n=28) have been seen at irregular intervals, mostly within Aldabra's large lagoon. We briefly report on a dedicated effort during the 2007 humpback whale season to gain information on abundance and group characteristics.",,"abundance index; atoll; biodiversity; field method; marine mammal; relative abundance; research program; seasonality; species diversity; temporal analysis; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Seychelles; Cetacea; Dugong dugon; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Stenella (Cetacea)",,,,,,,"Balance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Cetacean of the Western Tropical Indian Ocean: Distribution, relative abundance, and comparisons with cetacean communities of two other tropical ecosystems (1998) LMarine Mammal Science, 14, pp. 429-459; Barnes, J., Bellamy, D.J., Jones, D.J., Whitton, B., Drew, E., Kenyon, L., Lythgoe, J.N., Rosen, B.R., Morphology and ecology of the reef front of Aldabra (1971) Symposium of the Zoological Society of London, 28, pp. 87-114; Best, P.B., Findlay, K.P., Sekiguchi, K., Peddemors, V.M., Rakotonirina, B., Rossouw, A., Gove, D., Winter distribution and possible migration routes of humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae in the southwest Indian Ocean (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 162, pp. 287-299. , 12 February 1998; Blackmer, A.L., Anderson, S.K., Weinrich, M.T., Temporal variability in features used to photo-identify humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 338-354; Eyre, E.J., Observations of cetaceans in the Indian Ocean whale sanctuary (1995) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 45, pp. 419-426. , May-July 1993; Friday, N., Smith, T.D., Stevick, P.T., Allen, J., Measurement of photographic quality and individual distinctiveness for the photographic identification of humpback whales, megaptera novaeangliae (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 355-374; Keller, R.W., Leatherwood, S., Holt, S.J., Indian Ocean cetacean survey, Seychelles' Islands (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 503-513. , April through June 1980; Leatherwood, J.S., Donovan, G.P., (1991) Cetaceans and Cetacean Research in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary, , Marine Mammal Technical Report 3.

The primary feeding grounds for Revillagigedo humpbacks remain unknown. In February 2003, we deployed 11 Argos satellite-monitored radio tags to track movements and surfacings of humpback whales (five adults without calves, five mothers with calves, one calf) off Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Archipelago. Tracking ranged from 222 to 10,481 km over 4.9-149.1 d. Eight whales left Socorro Island: five visited other Mexican wintering destinations, seven moved north of these areas. Migration routes were primarily offshore (average 444 km). Two whales were tracked to feeding grounds: one to British Columbia (46 d migration), and one to Alaska (49 d migration). Mean travel speeds were 1.2 km/h in wintering areas, 4.0 km/h during migration, and 2.2 km/h in feeding areas. Overall surfacing rates ranged from 21 to 88 surfacings/h. Surfacing rates differed between the calf and all other whales, and between feeding areas and migratory/wintering areas for the calf and an adult without a calf. The calf also showed diel variation in surfacing rates. The offshore habits of tagged whales may explain scarce resightings of Revillagigedo humpbacks outside the Revillagigedo Archipelago. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Alaska; British Columbia; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Revillagigedo Archipelago; Satellite telemetry","archipelago; biotelemetry; feeding ground; migration route; movement; radiotelemetry; satellite imagery; subpopulation; tagging; whale; Alaska; British Columbia; Canada; Colima; Mexico [North America]; North America; Revillagigedo Islands; Socorro [Revillagigedo Islands]; United States; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutiérrez, A., Croll, D., Tershy, B., Feeding costs limit dive time in large whales (2002) Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1747-1753. , and; Au, W.W.L., Mobley, J., Burgess, W.C., Lammers, M.O., Nachtigall, P.E., Seasonal and diurnal trends of chorusing humpback whales wintering in waters off western Maui (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 530-544. , and; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119. , and; Baker, C.S., Medrano-Gonzalez, L., Calambokidis, J., Perry, A., Pichler, F., Rosenbaum, H., Straley, J.M., Von Ziegesar, O., Population structure of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation among humpback whales in the North Pacific (1998) Molecular Ecology, 7, pp. 695-707. , and; Brinton, E., Parameters relating to the distributions of planktonic organisms, especially euphasiids, in the eastern tropical Pacific (1979) Progress in Oceanography, 8, pp. 125-189; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Rasmussen, K., Urbán-R., J., Balcomb, K.C., Ladrón Deguevara, P., Salinas-Z., M., Darling, J.D., Migratory destinations of humpback whales that feed off California, Oregon and Washington (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 192, pp. 295-304. , and; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Herman, L.M., Cerchio, S., Salden, D.R., Urbán-R., J., Quinn, I.I.T.J., Movements and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 769-794. , and; Etnoyer, P., Canny, D., Mate, B.R., Morgan, L.E., Ortega-Ortiz, J.G., Nichols, W.J., Sea-surface temperature gradients across blue whale and sea turtle foraging trajectories off the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico (2006) Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 53, pp. 340-358. , and; Gabriele, C.M., Straley, J.M., Herman, L.M., Coleman, R.J., Fastest documented migration of a North Pacific humpback whale (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 457-464. , and; Gendron, D., Urban-R., J., Evidence of feeding by humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Baja California breeding ground, Mexico (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 76-81. , and; Heide-Jørgensen, M.-P., Kleivane, L., Øien, N., Laidre, K.L., Jensen, M.V., A new technique for deploying satellite transmitters on baleen whales: Tracking a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) in the North Atlantic (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 949-954. , and; Hiby, L.H., Fin whale surfacing rate as a calibration factor for cue-counting abundance estimates (1992) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 42, pp. 707-709; Mate, B.R., Gisiner, R., Mobley, J., Local and migratory movements of Hawaiian humpback whales tracked by satellite telemetry (1998) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 76, pp. 863-868. , and; Mate, B.R., Lagerquist, B.A., Calambokidis, J., Movements of North Pacific blue whales during the feeding season off southern California and their southern fall migration (1999) Marine Mammal Science, 15, pp. 1246-1257. , and; Mate, B., Mesecar, R., Lagerquist, B., The evolution of satellite-monitored radio tags for large whales: One laboratory's experience (2007) Deep-Sea Research II, 54, pp. 224-247. , and; Medrano-González, L., Aguayo-Lobo, A., Urbán-Ramírez, J., Baker, C.S., Diversity and distribution of mitochondrial DNA lineages among humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the Mexican Pacific Ocean (1995) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 73, pp. 1735-1743. , and; Medrano, L., Salinas, M., Salas, I., De Guevara, P.L., Aguayo, A., Jacobsen, J., Baker, C.S., Sex identification of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, on the wintering grounds of the Mexican Pacific Ocean (1994) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 72, pp. 1711-1774. , and; Mizroch, S.A., Herman, L.M., Straley, J.M., Glockner-Ferrari, D.A., Jurasz, C., Darling, J., Cerchio, S., Von Ziegesar, O., Estimating the adult survival rate of central north pacific humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2004) Journal of Mammalogy, 85, pp. 963-972. , and; Neter, J., Wasserman, W., Kutner, M.H., (1989) Applied Linear Regression Models., , and.

This breeding stock represents the remnants of a larger population heavily exploited during the beginning of the 20th century. Despite its relevance to conservation efforts, the degree of current genetic variation and the migratory relationship with Antarctic feeding areas for this population are still largely unknown. To examine these questions, we sequenced ∼400 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region from samples taken off the Brazilian coast (n = 171) and near the Antarctic Peninsula (n = 77). The genetic variability of the Brazilian humpback whale breeding population was high and similar to that found in other Southern Hemisphere breeding grounds. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the existence of a new mitochondrial clade that exists at low frequency among Southern Hemisphere populations. Direct comparison between the Brazilian and the Colombia breeding populations and the Antarctic Peninsula feeding population showed no genetic differentiation between this feeding region and the Colombian breeding area or between feeding Areas I and II near the Antarctic Peninsula. In contrast, these populations were genetically distinct from the Brazilian population. Two humpback whales sampled off South Georgia Islands, in the Scotia Sea, shared identical haplotypes to whales from Brazil. Our results, supported by photo-identification and satellite telemetry data, suggest that the main feeding area of the Southern Hemisphere humpback whale population is likely to be located near the South Georgia/South Sandwich Islands area and not in the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abrolhos Bank; Antarctic Peninsula; Genetic diversity; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mitochondrial DNA","biotelemetry; breeding site; comparative study; conservation genetics; migration; mitochondrial DNA; phylogenetics; satellite data; Southern Hemisphere; twentieth century; whale; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Brazil; South America; West Antarctica; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

To describe temporal changes in the relative abundance of humpback whales around Abrolhos, seven years (1998-2004) of whale count data were collected during July through to November. During one-hour-scans, observers determined group size within 9.3 km (5 n.m.) of a land-based observing station. A total of 930 scans, comprising 7996 sightings of adults and 2044 calves were analysed using generalized linear models that included variables for time of day, day of the season, years and two-way interactions as possible predictors. The pattern observed was the gradual build-up and decline in whale counts within seasons. Patterns and peaks of adult and calf counts varied among years. Although fluctuation was observed, there was generally an increasing trend in adult counts among years. Calf counts increased only in 2004. These fluctuations may have been caused by some environmental conditions in humpback whales' summering grounds and also by changes in spatial-temporal concentrations in Abrolhos Bank. The general pattern observed within the study area mirrored what was observed in the whole Abrolhos Bank. Knowledge of the consistency with which humpback whales use this important nursing area should prove beneficial for designing future monitoring programmes especially related to whale watching activities around Abrolhos Archipelago. ©2008 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Abrolhos Bank; Abundance; Generalized linear model; Humpback whale; Land-based station; Megaptera novaeangliae","breeding site; coastal zone; environmental conditions; group size; numerical model; nursery ground; population growth; relative abundance; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; whale; Abrolhos Archipelago; Bahia; Brazil; South America; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Andriolo A., Kinas P.G., Engel M.H. and Martins C.C.A.

Given the spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Adelie penguins; Foraging; Humpback whales; Krill","abundance; climate change; community structure; crustacean; demography; forage; interspecific interaction; prey availability; prey preference; relative abundance; seabird; whale; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Anvers Island; West Antarctica; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Sydeman, W.J., Parrish, R.H., Lenarz, W.H., Oceanic factors influencing distribution of young rockfish (Sebastes) in central California: A predator's perspective (1993) Calif Coop Ocean Fish Invest Rep, 34, pp. 133-139; Ainley, D.G., Ballard, G., Dugger, K.M., Competition among penguins and cetaceans reveal trophic cascades in the Western Ross Sea, Antarctica (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 2080-2093. , 8; Atkinson, A., Siegel, V., Pakhomov, E., Rothery, P., Long-term decline in krill stock and increase in salps within the Southern Ocean (2004) Nature, 432, pp. 100-103; Boyd, I.L., Arnould, J.P.Y., Barton, T., Croxall, J.P., Foraging behavior of Antarctic fur seals during periods of contrasting prey abundance (1994) J Anim Ecol, 63, pp. 703-713; Chappell, M.A., Shoemaker, V.H., Janes, D.H., Maloney, S.K., Bucher, T.L., Energetics of foraging in breeding Adelie penguins (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 2450-2461; Croxall, J.P., Reid, K., Prince, P.A., Diet, provisioning and productivity of marine predators to differences in availability of Antarctic krill (1999) Mar Ecol Progress Ser, 177, pp. 115-131; Fraser, W.M., Hofmann, E.E., A predator's perspective on causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response (2003) Mar Ecol Progress Ser, 265, pp. 1-15; Fraser, W.M., Trivelpiece, W.Z., Ainley, D.G., Trivelpiece, S.G., Increases in Antarctic penguin populations: Reduced competition with whales or a loss of sea ice due to global warming?

The survey covered the area between Cape Farewell and Disko Island on the West Greenland coast out to the 200m depth contour. The surveyed area covered 163,574km 2 and a total of 246 sightings of 9 cetacean species were obtained. Abundance estimates were developed for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (21 sightings), fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus (78 sightings) and common minke whales, B. acutorostrata (42 sightings). The mean group size of humpback whales was 3.30 but groups as large as 95 animals were seen off effort. The mean group size of fin whales was 2.96 with groups as large as 50 seen. Common minke whale group size was 1.1 with only one sighting of a group of two whales. Humpback whales were found both in offshore and coastal areas of West Greenland with the exception of Store Hellefiske Bank and the Cape Farewell offshore area. The line transect abundance estimate of humpback whales was 1, 218 (CV=0.56), uncorrected for submerged whales (availability bias) and whales that were available to be seen but were missed by the observers (perception bias). Fin whales were observed in all areas of the survey and the uncorrected line transect estimate was 1, 660 (CV=0.38). When corrected for perception bias the estimates increases to 3,234 fin whales (CV=0.44). Common minke whales were found in almost equal densities in all strata except for the Cape Farewell offshore area, where none were seen. The cue-counting abundance estimate of common minke whales was 4, 856 (CV=0.49) for West Greenland using a cue rate of 46.3 cues per hour (CV=0.11). If the estimate is corrected for perception bias the common minke whale abundance is estimated to be 10,792 whales (CV=0.59). Low coverage was attained in the northern area of West Greenland and this should cause an especially large negative bias for the estimates of fin whale and humpback whale abundance because this area is believed to have particularly large densities of these whales.","Abundance estimate; Common minke whale; Cue counting; Distribution; Fin whale; g(0); Humpback whale; Northern hemisphere; School size; Survey-Aerial; Survey-Vessel","abundance estimation; aerial survey; demographic survey; Northern Hemisphere; population density; spatial distribution; whale; Arctic; Cape Farewell; Disko Island; Egger Island; Greenland; West Greenland; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Hedley, S.L., Southern Hemisphere group IV humpback whales: Their status from recent aerial survey (2001) Mem.

The present work reviews the current knowledge on cetaceans species and extends this knowledge with an analysis of cetaceans stranded in the Parnaiba Delta, on the coast of Maranhão State, Brazil. The studies on cetacean diversity on the coast of the Parnaíba Delta were made from August 2004 to August 2006. Fourteen strandings were reported, representing six distinct species, such as the estuarine dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni), dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), pigmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and two specimens which have not yet been identified. The significant degree of cetacean diversity in the region shows that the Parnaíba Delta is, possibly, of an important area for cetacean studies in Brasil.","Brazil; Cetacean; Maranhão; Parnaiba Delta; Stranding","animal; article; biodiversity; Brazil; Cetacea; classification; Animals; Biodiversity; Brazil; Cetacea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera edeni; Cetacea; Feresa attenuata; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Sotalia guianensis",,,,,,,"ALVES-JÚNIOR, T.T., ÁVILA, F.J.C., OLIVEIRA, J.A., FURTADO-NETO, M.A., MONTEIRO-NETO, C., Registro de cetáceos para o litoral do Estado do Ceará, Brasil (1996) Arq.

We investigated song function by obtaining simultaneous observations of the positions and movements of singing and nonsinging whales in real time during their migration off the east coast of Australia. We collected movement data by acoustic tracking using a hydrophone array, land-based visual tracking and observations from a small boat. Of the 114 singers analysed, 66 (58%) associated with conspecifics. Singers were significantly more likely to join groups containing a mother-calf pair than other groups. Males started to sing after joining groups only if they consisted of a mother-calf pair not escorted by another male. Singers also associated longer and sang for a significantly greater proportion of time with mother-calf pairs than any other group type. Associating with mother-calf pairs has been shown to be a reproductively successful strategy for males. In contrast, whales that joined singers were usually lone males; these associations were brief and singers typically stopped singing in the presence of other males. This is the highest reported incidence in humpback whales of males singing when escorting females and supports an intersexual function of song in humpback whales. We suggest that males joining singers are prospecting for females rather than engaging in male social ordering and that singing may incur the cost of attracting competing males. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic tracking; humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; sexual selection; social interaction; song","acoustic method; breeding season; female behavior; intrasexual interaction; male behavior; mate choice; sexual selection; social behavior; song; whale; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Aasen, E., Medrano, J.F., Amplification of the ZFY and ZFX genes for sex identification in humans, cattle, sheep and goats (1990) Bio/Technology, 8, pp. 1279-1281; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Baker, C.S., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., Early, G., O'Brien, S.J., Molecular genetic identification of the sex of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission Special Issue, 13, pp. 105-111; Ball, G.F., Dufty Jr., A.M., Assessing hormonal responses to acoustic stimulation (1998) Animal Acoustic Communication, pp. 379-395. , Hopp S.L., Owren M.J., and Evans C.S.

Between 13 October and 25 November 2006, young of the year and juvenile great white sharks were observed scavenging from the carcass of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Although more than one shark scavenged from the carcass, simultaneous feeding was not observed. The sharks showed a clear preference for soft tissue at sites along the mouth of the carcass. Protective ocular rotation was rarely observed and none of the sharks exhibited palatoquadrate protrusion while feeding. These observations provide a new insight into the foraging behaviour of young of the year and juvenile great white sharks. The prevalence of small great white sharks (1.5 m TL) and the absence of any individuals greater than 3.65 m TL suggest that Algoa Bay may function as a nursery area for great white sharks in South Africa. This information is crucial not only to improve our understanding of great white shark biology, but also for their long-term management and conservation in South Africa. © CSIRO 2008.","Carcass; Cetacean; Juvenile; Scavenging; South Africa","conservation management; feeding behavior; food preference; juvenile; nursery ground; scavenging (feeding); shark; whale; Africa; Algoa Bay; Eastern Cape; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Carcharodon carcharias; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bass, A.

A second, relatively understudied area of humpback acoustic communication concerns un-patterned sounds known as ""social sounds,"" produced by both males and females. These include vocalizations as well as sounds produced at the surface of the water as a result of surface behaviors (e.g., breaching, pectoral slapping). This study describes a portion of the non-song social sound repertoire of southward migrating humpbacks in Australian waters, and explores the social relevance of these sounds. On migration, humpback whales travel in social groups of varying compositions. These social groups are not stable in that humpback whales continually change group composition by splitting from, or joining with, other groups. The results of this study suggest that ""breaching"" and ""slapping"" have a communicative function. Other sounds such as ""underwater blows"" and ""cries"" were heard mainly in competitive groups while other low-frequency sounds such as ""grumbles,"" ""snorts,"" ""thwops,"" and ""wops"" may function in intra- or inter-group communication. Particular sounds (""grunts,"" ""groans,"" and ""barks"") were almost exclusive to joining pods suggesting a role in social integration. Social sounds in humpbacks may have specific social and behavioral functions relating to social group composition, and the mediation of interactions between these social groups. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic communication; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Social vocalizations; Surface-generated behaviors","behavioral ecology; group behavior; migration; migratory species; song; whale; Haemulidae; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., (1993) The Sonar of Dolphins., , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937. , and; Beecher, M.D., Stoddard, P.K., Campbell, S.E., Horning, C.L., Repertoire matching between neighbouring song sparrows (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 917-923. , and; Brown, M., Corkeron, P., Pod characteristics of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) during migration off the east coast of Australia (1995) Behaviour, 132, pp. 163-179. , and; Caldwell, M.C., Caldwell, D.K., Behavior of marine animals: Current perspectives in research (1979) Cetaceans., 3, pp. 369-401. , and.

Tags allowed for whale dive depths to be recorded in real time. Acoustic and mid-water trawl surveys were conducted concurrent with tagging efforts within the study area to quantify available fish resources and describe potential prey selection by humpback whales. Recorded dives were grouped through visual assessment and t-tests. Dives that indicated likely foraging occurred at a mean maximum depth of 106.2 m with 62% of dives occurring between 92 m and 120 m. Acoustic backscatter from fish surveys was attributed to potential humpback prey based on known target strength values and 10 net tows. Capelin comprised 84% of the total potential prey abundance in the region followed by age 0 (12%) and juvenile pollock (2%), and eulachon (<1%). Although horizontally segregated in the region, both capelin and age 0 pollock were distributed at depths exceeding 92 m with maximum abundance between 107 m and 120 m. The four-tagged humpbacks were found to forage in areas with greatest capelin densities but bypassed areas of high age 0 pollock abundance. The location and diving behavior of tagged whales suggested that whales were favoring capelin over pollock as a prey source. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic tag; Cetacean; Dive behavior; Fish acoustic sampling; Foraging; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Prey","abundance; acoustics; backscatter; diving; fishery survey; foraging behavior; prey availability; prey selection; real time; sampling; survey; tagging; teleost; trawling; visual analysis; whale; Alaska; North America; United States; Cetacea; Mallotus (fish); Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Pollachius; Thaleichthys",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Guitierrez, A., Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales (2002) The Journal for Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1747-1753. , and; Bax, N.J., A comparison of the fish biomass flow to fish, fisheries, and mammals in six marine ecosystems (1991) ICES Marine Science Symposium, 193, pp. 217-224; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 124-135. , and; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 264, pp. 155-166. , and; Carbone, C., Houston, A.I., Patterns in the diving behaviour of the pochard, Aythya ferina: A test of an optimality model (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 457-465. , and; Carbone, C., Houston, A.I., The optimal allocation of time over the dive cycle.

Sequencing of mtDNA from a skin biopsy showed the cow to be an El haplotype, which is common in the California feeding population. Both animals had lacerations, suggesting sharp trauma from a boat strike. Photographs taken over 11 d showed generalized deterioration of skin condition and necrotic wound edges. Behavioral responses were downriver to the Pacific Ocean. The attempts included playback of alarm tones, humpback and killer whale sounds, banging hollow steel pipes (""Oikami pipes""), spraying water from fire hoses on the water surface, and utilizing tug and power boat engine noise and movement. None of these deterrents resulted in significant, consistent downstream movement by the whales. Antibiotic therapy (ceftiofur) was administered by a dart, representing the first reported antibiotic treatment of free-ranging live whales. After 11 d, the animals swam downstream from fresh water at Rio Vista to brackish water, and their skin condition noticeably improved 24 h later. The animals followed the deep-water channel through the Sacramento Delta and San Francisco Bay, reaching the ocean at least 20 d after first entering the Sacramento River.","Antibiotics; Biopsy; Freshwater; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Playbacks","antibiotics; behavioral response; disease treatment; movement; whale; California; North America; Pacific Ocean; Sacramento Delta; Sacramento River; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Hearing in whales and dolphins: An overview (2000) Hearing bv whales and dolphins, pp. 1-42. , W.

Using a relational database containing information from the museums of Venezuela, published and unpublished records were incorporated into a Geographical Information System (MapInfo Professional 7.0). A total of 53 records were gathered, of which sightings made up 72%, followed by acoustic sampling (9%) intentional capture (6%), stranding (6%) and unknown records (8%). Humpback whales were mainly sighted over the continental shelf of the northeastern region in shallow waters of 0-100m in depth. The date on which each record was made supports the seasonal occurrence of North Atlantic humpback whales off the Venezuelan coast. Opportunistic sightings and stranding records from the austral winter months do not give conclusive proof that Southern Hemisphere humpback whales are present during this time, but lead to the hypothesis that whales migrate from Brazil. Systematic research effort (especially photo-identification) is recommended in order to better understand humpback whale movements, distribution and identity.","Atlantic Ocean; Carribean Sea; Distribution; Humpback whale; Movements; Northern Hemisphere; South America; Whaling-historical","acoustic survey; continental shelf; geographical distribution; GIS; identification key; population migration; seasonality; spatial distribution; species occurrence; temporal distribution; whale; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; South America; Venezuela; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Acevedo, R., (2001) Distribución y caracterización de hábitats de los cetáceos marinos reportados en las costas de Venezuela, , BSc thesis.

Planning effective marine protected areas that encompass humpback critical habitats require data about which oceanographic features influence distribution during the breeding period. This study examines the relationship between water depth and ocean floor slope with humpback whale distribution, based on sightings during two breeding seasons (2005 and 2006). Data are from the Southern and Northern subpopulations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Analysis followed the basic principles of the Ecological Niche Factors Analysis (ENFA), where indices of Marginality and Tolerance provide insights on the restrictiveness of habitat use. At a fine scale, physical factors such as water depth and slope define the critical breeding and nursing habitat for M. novaeangliae. Divergence in the subsamples means of depths and slope distribution, with the global mean of the study area in both eco-geographical variables, determine habitat requirements restricted by topographic features such as depths (< 100 m) and slope (< 10%), and locate the key breeding and nursing habitat of the species within the continental shelf domains. Proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPA's) network plans should consider connectivity of Caño Island-Drake Bay and the extension of Corcovado National Park maritime borders.","Breeding area; Critical habitat; Marine protected area; Megaptera novaeangliae; Nursery area","animal; article; breeding; Costa Rica; ecosystem; female; geography; humpback whale; male; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population migration; Animal Migration; Animals; Breeding; Costa Rica; Ecosystem; Female; Geography; Humpback Whale; Male; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Osa",,,,,,,"Acevedo, R., Oviedo, L., Silva, N., Identification of key areas to conservation of misticetes cetaceans off Margarita Island (2003) Simposio Extinción en Margarita, 5. , Paper presented at the, Congreso Venezolano de Ecología.

However, owing to an increase in the occurrence of the species along the north coast of the State of Bahia, it has been suggested that the species is reoccupying that region, which was probably utilized by the whales before commercial whaling. Information is presented on the occurrence and distribution of humpback whales along the north coast of the State of Bahia, with a comparative overview, for the period 2000-2006. Daily research cruises were conducted from July to October, departing from Praia do Forte (13°40′S 38°10′W) and lasting ∼9 h. Data on sampling and sighting effort, and geographical position and composition of groups of humpback whales, were collected on standardized field sheets. In all, 230 surveys were performed, covering some 9740 nautical miles in 1645 h of sampling effort, during which 1626 humpback whales were sighted, including 118 calves. Humpback whales were sighted throughout the study area. Solitary individuals and pairs were the most frequent group composition, 26% and 37% of the observed groups (n = 723), respectively. Depth of water varied from 15 to 1657 m (mean = 62.4; s.d. = 99). The sightings values were grouped into depth classes to ascertain the highest frequencies (∼30%) for the two classes, i.e. between 35.1 and 55 m of water. There was an increase in the encounter rates of humpback whales on the north coast of the State of Bahia between 2000 and 2006, identifying a difference in SPUE [sightings per unit (h) of effort] among years (Kruskal-Wallis H = 30.155, d.f. = 6, p < 0.05). The results support the hypothesis that humpback whales are reoccupying former breeding areas along the Brazilian coast. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Here analyses are presented for examining the effects of photographic quality and individual animal distinctiveness scores and for objectively selecting a subset of data to use for capture-recapture analyses using humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) data from a 2-year study in the North Atlantic. Photographs were evaluated for their level of quality and whales for their level of individual distinctiveness. Photographic quality scores had a 0.21 probability of changing by a single-quality level, and there were no changes by two or more levels. Individual distinctiveness scores were not independent of photographic quality scores. Estimates of abundance decreased as poor-quality photographs were removed. An appropriate balance between precision and bias in abundance estimates was achieved by removing the lowest-quality photographs and those of incompletely photographed flukes given our assumptions about the true population abundance.

Under straight pull abrasion tests, an adult right whale fluke required 3.7 times the load and 15 times the draw-length of a right whale calf flipper to induce epidermal failure whereas a humpback fluke was intermediate between these extremes. A load applied tangentially to the leading edge of the fluke or flipper resulted in a substantial, but reversible, deflection of the leading edge in the direction of the applied load. The maximum possible deformation of the leading edge under shear load, prior to the line slipping relative to the skin, was defined as the tissue compliance limit. Oscillatory abrasion tests revealed that line draw-lengths exceeding the tissue compliance limit resulted in substantially increased tissue abrasion. In actual entanglements, line draw-length relative to the tissue compliance may determine if the line will cut into the body or simply press against the skin. Increasing the entangling line's ability to stretch in response to a load could potentially minimize sliding of the line relative to the skin and help mitigate entanglement injuries. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Cetacean; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Humpback whale; Injury; Megaptera novaeangliae; Modeling; Right whale","ecological modeling; experimental study; injury; muscle; skin; testing method; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Cloete, S.W.P., Schalkwyk, S.J.V., Hoffman, L.C., Meyer, A., Effect of age on leather and skin traits of slaughter ostriches (2004) South African Journal of Animal Science, 34, pp. 80-86. , and; Cua, A.B., Wilhelm, K.P., Maibach, H.I., Elastic properties of human skin: Relation to age, sex, and anatomical region (1990) Archives of Dermatological Research, 282, pp. 283-288. , and; Fung, Y.C., (1981) Biomechanics., , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Geraci, J.R., Lounsbury, V.J., (2005) Marine Mammals Ashore: A Field Guide for Strandings., , and.

During March 2006, an underwater video camera and two-element hydrophone array were used to record nonsong vocalizations from a mother-calf escort off Hawaii. Acoustic data were analyzed; measured time delays between hydrophones provided bearings to 21 distinct vocalizations produced by the male calf. Signals were pulsed (71%), frequency modulated (19%), or amplitude modulated (10%). They were of simple structure, low frequency (mean=220 Hz), brief duration (mean=170 ms), and relatively narrow bandwidth (mean=2 kHz). The calf produced three series of ""grunts"" when approaching the diver. During winters of the years 2001-2005 in Hawaii, nonsong vocalizations were recorded in 109 (65%) of 169 groups with a calf using an underwater video and single (omnidirectional) hydrophone. Nonsong vocalizations were most common (34 of 39) in lone mother-calf pairs. A subsample from this dataset of 60 signals assessed to be vocalizations provided strong evidence that 10 male and 18 female calves vocalized based on statistical similarity to the 21 verified calf signals, proximity to an isolated calf (27 of 28 calves), strong signal-to-noise ratio, and/or bubble emissions coincident to sound. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Amplitude modulation; Hydrophones; Signal to noise ratio; Time delay; Underwater cameras; Video cameras; Acoustic data; Nonsong vocalizations; Underwater video; Underwater acoustics; acoustics; animal experiment; article; calf (mammal); female; humpback whale; male; nonhuman; priority journal; signal noise ratio; television camera; United States; videorecording; vocalization; Acoustics; Animal Communication; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Hawaii; Humpback Whale; Videotape Recording; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Darling, J., Andrews, K., High-frequency harmonics and source level of humpback whale songs (2001) J.

Automatic techniques are described for isolation of target signals from background noise, extraction of features from target signals and unsupervised classification (clustering) of the target signals based on these features. The only user-provided inputs, other than raw sound, is an initial set of signal processing and control parameters. Of particular note is that the number of signal categories is determined automatically. The techniques, applied to hydrophone recordings of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), produce promising initial results, suggesting that they may be of use in automated analysis of not only humpbacks, but possibly also in other bioacoustic settings where automated analysis is desirable. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Classification (of information); Hydrophones; Sound recording; Unsupervised learning; Bioacoustics; Hydrophone recordings; Unsupervised classification; Speech intelligibility; acoustics; article; automation; humpback whale; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; signal processing; sound detection; vocalization; Acoustics; Animal Communication; Animals; Automatic Data Processing; Birds; Mathematics; Noise; Signal Detection (Psychology)",,,,,,,"Das, S., Picheny, M., Issues in practical large vocabulary isolated word recognition: The IBM Tangora system (1996) Automatic Speech and Speaker Recognition, pp. 457-479. , edited by C.Lee, F.Soong, and K.Paliwal (Kluwer Academic, New York; Rabiner, L., Sambur, M., An algorithm for determining endpoints of isolated utterances (1975) Bell Syst.

We used 3650 identification photographs from 16 wintering or feeding areas collected during 1990 to 1993 to determine conservative estimates in the percentage of whales with rake mark scarring. Dramatic differences were seen in the incidence of rake marks among regions, with highest rates on wintering grounds off Mexico (26 vs. 14 % at others) and feeding areas off California (20 vs. 6% at others), 2 areas between which humpback whales migrate. Although attacks are rarely witnessed, the prevalence of scars demonstrates that a substantial portion of animals are attacked, particularly those that migrate between California and Mexico. Our data also suggest that most attacks occur at or near the wintering grounds in the eastern North Pacific. The prevalence of attacks indicates that killer whale predation has the potential to be a major cause of mortality and a driving force in migratory behavior; however, the location of the attacks is inconsistent with the hypothesis that animals migrate to tropical waters to avoid predation. Our conclusion is that, at least in recent decades, attacks are made primarily on calves at the winteiing grounds; this contradicts the hypothesis that killer whales historically preyed heavily on large whales in high-latitude feeding areas in the North Pacific. © Inter-Research 2008.","Fluke scarring; Humpback whale; Killer whale; North Pacific; Predation; Rake marks","geographical variation; migratory behavior; mortality risk; predation; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Animalia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., (2002) Killer whales of the world, , Voyageur Press, Stillwater, MN; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Ecological and social determinant of group size in transient killer whales (1996) Behav Ecol, 7, pp. 408-416; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., and others, Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 31, pp. 105-119; Baldridge, A., Killer whales attack and eat a gray whale (1972) J Mammal, 53, pp. 898-900; Black, N.A., Schulman-Janiger, A., Tennullo, R.L., Guerrero-Ruiz, M., Killer whales off California and western Mexico: A catalog of photo-identified individuals (1997) NOAA Technical Memorandum, NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-247, , National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA; Brodie, P., Beck, P., Predation by sharks on the grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus) in eastern Canada (1983) Can J Aquat Sci, 40, pp. 267-271; Brown, M.R., Corkeron, P.J., Hale, P.T., Shultz, K.W., Bryden, M.M., Evidence for a sex-segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 259, pp. 229-234; Calambokidis, J., Barlow, J., Abundance of blue and humpback whales in the eastern North Pacific estimated by capture-recapture and line-transect methods (2004) Mar Mamm Sci, 20, pp. 63-85; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Quinn II, T.M., and others, Abundance and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific Basin (1997) Rep to SW Fish Sci Ctr, , www.cascadiaresedrch.org/reports/rep-NPAC.pdf, La Jolla, CA.

We found that whenever these pairs were at the surface they maintained close proximity similar to that observed in terrestrial followers. By examining their dive behaviour, however, we determined that calves dive significantly less frequently and for shorter durations than their mothers, leading to periods of separation during foraging dives. Because this is likely to increase the risk of calf predation, females responded by significantly shortening the duration of their dives when unaccompanied by their offspring, thereby reducing this risk. As the season progressed, we observed that this behaviour waned and females became significantly less responsive to their offspring. At the same time, calves appeared to increase their role in maintaining proximity by synchronizing their dives with the mothers increasingly often. We discuss this shift in proximity maintenance in terms of the energetics associated with lactation, increased foraging effort by the offspring and parent-offspring conflict. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","dive; follower; humpback whale; maternal behaviour; Megaptera novaeangliae","bioenergetics; diving behavior; feeding ground; lactation; maternal care; parent-offspring interaction; whale; Alaska; North America; United States; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This research was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

A dual-source airgun array firing a total volume of either 5,085 in3 (Survey 1) or 3,147 in3 (Survey 2) in an alternate source activation sequence was active during 51% of the analysed effort. A total of 207 sightings of humpback whales (n = 66), sperm whales (n = 124), and Atlantic spotted dolphins (n = 17) was recorded. The encounter rate (sightings/h) of humpback and sperm whales did not differ significantly according to airgun operational status. The mean distance to humpback and sperm whale sightings was greater during full-array operations than during guns off, but this difference was not significant. Atlantic spotted dolphin encounters occurred at a significantly greater distance from the airgun array (p &lt; 0.001) during full-array operations than during guns off. Positive-approach behaviour by Atlantic spotted dolphins (n = 9) occurred only during guns-off periods. There was no evidence for prolonged or large-scale displacement of each species from the region during the 10-mo survey duration. Sperm whale sightings showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.001) during the survey, while Atlantic spotted dolphin encounters occurred at similar rates. A decreased occurrence of humpback whale sightings (p &lt; 0.001) corresponded with established seasonal migration out of the survey area. Contrary to expectation based on perceived sensitivity, Atlantic spotted dolphins exhibited the most marked overt response to airgun sound of the three cetacean species examined.","Airguns; Angola; Atlantic spotted dolphin; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus; Seismic survey; Sperm whale; Stenella frontalis","dolphin; exploration; seismic method; seismic survey; whale; Africa; Angola; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella frontalis",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Cetacean abundance in Hawaiian waters estimated from a summer/fall survey in 2002 (2006) Marine Mammal Science, 22, pp. 446-464; Best, P.B., Reeb, D., Morais, M., Baird, A., (1999) A preliminary investigation of humpback whales off northern Angola, , Paper SC/51/CAWS33 submitted to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. 12 pp; Bowles, A.E., Smultea, M., Würsig, B., DeMaster, D.P., Palka, D., Relative abundance and behaviour of marine mammals exposed to transmission from the Heard Island feasibility test (1994) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 96, pp. 2469-2484; Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative analysis (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 508-511; Clarke, R., An index of sighting conditions for surveys of whales and dolphins (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, pp. 559-561. , 32; Cummings, W.C., Thompson, P.O., Cook, R., Underwater sounds of migrating gray whales, Eschrichtius glaucus (Cope) (1968) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 44, pp. 1278-1281; Finneran, J.J., Schlundt, C.E., Dear, R., Carder, D.A., Ridgway, S.H., Temporary shift in masked hearing thresholds in odontocetes after exposure to single underwater impulses from a seismic watergun (2002) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 111, pp. 2929-2940; Fulling, G.L., Mullin, K.D., Abundance of cetaceans in the southern U.S. North Atlantic Ocean during summer 1998 (2003) Fishery Bulletin, 101, pp. 603-613; Gailey, G., Würsig, B., McDonald, T.L., Abundance, behavior, and movement patterns of western gray whales in relation to a 3-D seismic survey, Northeast Sakhalin Island, Russia (2007) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 134, pp. 75-91; Goold, J.C., Acoustic assessment of populations of common dolphin Delphinus delphis in conjunction with seismic surveying (1996) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 76, pp. 811-820; Goold, J.C., Fish, P.J., Broadband spectra of seismic survey air-gun emissions, with reference to dolphin auditory thresholds (1998) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 103, pp. 2177-2184; Gordon, J.C.D., Gillespie, D., Potter, J., Frantzis, A., Simmonds, M.P., Swift, R., A review of the effects of seismic surveys on marine mammals (2004) Marine Technology Society Journal, 37, pp. 16-34; Greene Jr., C.R., Richardson, W.J., Characteristics of marine seismic survey sounds in the Beaufort Sea (1988) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 83, pp. 2246-2254; Gulland, J.A., Walker, C.D.T., Marine seismic overview (2001) Proceedings of the seismic and marine mammals workshop, , M.

The significance of killer whale Orcinus orca predation on baleen whales (Mysticeti) has been a topic of considerable discussion and debate in recent years. Discourse has been constrained by poor understanding of predator-prey dynamics, including the relative vulnerability of different mysticete species and age classes to killer whales and how these prey animals avoid predation. Here we provide an overview and analysis of predatory interactions between killer whales and mysticetes, with an emphasis on patterns of antipredator responses. 2. Responses of baleen whales to predatory advances and attacks by killer whales appear to fall into two distinct categories, which we term the fight and flight strategies. The fight strategy consists of active physical defence, including self-defence by single individuals, defence of calves by their mothers and coordinated defence by groups of whales. It is documented for five mysticetes: southern right whale Eubalaena australis, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. The flight strategy consists of rapid (20-40 km/ h) directional swimming away from killer whales and, if overtaken and attacked, individuals do little to defend themselves. This strategy is documented for six species in the genus Balaenoptera. 3. Many aspects of the life history, behaviour and morphology of mysticetes are consistent with their antipredator strategy, and we propose that evolution of these traits has been shaped by selection for reduced predation. Fight species tend to have robust body shapes and are slow but relatively manoeuvrable swimmers. They often calve or migrate in coastal areas where proximity to shallow water provides refuge and an advantage in defence. Most fight species have either callosities (rough and hardened patches of skin) or encrustations of barnacles on their bodies, which may serve (either primarily or secondarily) as weapons or armour for defence. Flight species have streamlined body shapes for high-speed swimming and they can sustain speeds necessary to outrun pursuing killer whales (>15-20 km/h). These species tend to favour pelagic habitats and calving grounds where prolonged escape sprints from killer whales are possible. 4. The rarity of observed successful attacks by killer whales on baleen whales, especially adults, may be an indication of the effectiveness of these antipredator strategies. Baleen whales likely offer low profitability to killer whales, relative to some other marine mammal prey. High-speed pursuit of flight species has a high energetic cost and a low probability of success while attacks on fight species can involve prolonged handling times and a risk of serious injury. © Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.","Cetacean; Defence; Killer whale; Orcinus orca; Predation; Predator avoidance","antipredator defense; marine mammal; morphology; pelagic environment; predation; predator-prey interaction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Orcinus orca; Thoracica",,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea I.

Vessel noise has the potential to interfere with the complex vocal behavior of these humpback whales which could have direct consequences on their feeding behavior and thus ultimately on their health and reproduction. Humpback whale feeding calls recorded during conditions of high vessel-generated noise and lower levels of background noise are compared for differences in acoustic structure, use, and organization using information theoretic measures. We apply information theory in a self-referential manner (i.e., orders of entropy) to quantify the changes in signaling behavior. We then compare this with the reduction in channel capacity due to noise in Glacier Bay itself treating it as a (Gaussian) noisy channel. We find that high vessel noise is associated with an increase in the rate and repetitiveness of sequential use of feeding call types in our averaged sample of humpback whale vocalizations, indicating that vessel noise may be modifying the patterns of use of feeding calls by the endangered humpback whales in Southeast Alaska. The information theoretic approach suggested herein can make a reliable quantitative measure of such relationships and may also be adapted for wider application to many species where environmental noise is thought to be a problem.","Anthropogenic noise; Humpback whales; Information theory; Vocal behavior; Wildlife conservation",,,,,,,,"Richardson, J.W., (1998) Marine Mammals and Noise, , Academic Press: New York, NY; Baker, C.

Historically, a portion of this population was targeted in a local commercial whale fishery. The fishery was conducted in eastern Kodiak Island out of Port Hobron, Alaska, between 1926 and 1937 and resulted in the removal of nearly 1,600 humpback whales. An estimated 157 (95% confidence interval: 114, 241) whales were in the study area in 2002 based on the Schnabel maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for closed populations. The Schnabel MLE of abundance in 2002 and historic catch values were used to back-calculate the historical abundance trend in the study area between 1925 and 2002 using a delay-difference model with a density dependent recruitment function. Historical abundances were calculated both prior to commercial whaling in 1925 and immediately post-whaling in 1938. Estimated abundance within the study area just prior to commercial whaling was 343 (331, 376). Immediately following the cessation of whaling in 1938, estimated abundance within the study area was 27 (14, 61). Results from this study show the Port Hobron whale fishery likely had a significant impact on the local humpback whale population.

This study presents the social vocalization repertoire of migrating east Australian humpback whales from a sample of 660 sounds recorded from 61 groups of varying composition, over three years. The social vocalization repertoire of humpback whales was much larger than previously described with a total of 34 separate call types classified aurally and by spectrographic analysis as well as statistically. Of these, 21 call types were the same as units of the song current at the time of recording but used individually instead of as part of the song sequence, while the other 13 calls were stable over the three years of the study and were not part of the song. This study provides a catalog of sounds that can be used as a basis for future studies.

Territ. 0909, Australia","Despite the impression held by some that few biological mysteries remain, even evocative species such as humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have poorly documented movement patterns, reproductive strategies and population dynamics despite years of dedicated research. This is largely due to the difficulty of observing wide-ranging marine species over the majority of their life cycle. The advent of powerful tracking devices has certainly improved our understanding, but it is usually only with molecular tools that the nature of population structure becomes apparent. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Castro and colleagues have provided the first global-scale assessment of population structure for the largest fish - whale sharks (Rhincodon typus). Whale sharks can reach lengths > 12 m and are a popular tourist attraction at places where they aggregate, yet for most of their life cycle, we know little indeed of where they go and how they interact with other populations. Previous tracking studies imply a high dispersal capacity, but only now have Castro and colleagues demonstrated high gene flow and haplotype diversity among the major ocean basins where they are found. © 2007 The Author.",,"animal; gene pool; genetics; histology; physiology; population dynamics; shark; short survey; swimming; Animals; Gene Pool; Population Dynamics; Sharks; Swimming; Carcharodon carcharias; Cetacea; Chelonia mydas; Chondrichthyes; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Rhincodon typus; Rhincodontidae; Testudines",,,,,,,"Baum, J.K., Myers, R.A., Kehler, D.G., Al, E., Collapse and conservation of shark populations in the Northwest Atlantic (2003) Science, 299, pp. 389-392; Bonfil, R., Meÿer, M., Scholl, M.C., Al, E., Transoceanic migration, spatial dynamics, and population linkages of white sharks (2005) Science, 310, pp. 100-103; Bradshaw, C.J.A., Mollet, H.F., Meekan, M.G., Inferring population trends for the world's largest fish from mark-recapture estimates of survival (2007) Journal of Animal Ecology, 76, pp. 480-489; Castro, A.L.F., Stewart, B.S., Wilson, S.G., Al, E., Population genetic structure of Earth's largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus (2007) Molecular Ecology, 16, pp. 5183-5192; Duncan, K.M., Martin, A.P., Bowen, B.W., De Couet, H.G., Global phylogeography of the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini (2006) Molecular Ecology, 15, pp. 2239-2251; Hays, G.C., Houghton, J.D.R., Myers, E.H., Endangered species: Pan-Atlantic leatherback turtle movements (2004) Nature, 429, p. 522; (2006) IUCN Red List of Threatened Species., , http://www.iucnredlist.org, IUCN (.

Since this time, there have been a few summer time visual surveys for these species, but no overview of year-round use of these waters by endangered whales primarily because standard visual survey data are difficult and costly. From October 1999-May 2002, moored hydrophones were deployed in six locations in the GoA to record whale calls. Reception of calls from fin, humpback, and blue whales and an unknown source, called Watkins' whale, showed seasonal and geographic variation. Calls were detected more often during the winter than during the summer, suggesting that animals inhabit the GoA year-round. To estimate the distance at which species-diagnostic calls could be heard, parabolic equation propagation loss models for frequencies characteristic of each of each call type were run. Maximum detection ranges in the subarctic North Pacific ranged from 45 to 250 km among three species (fin, humpback, blue), although modeled detection ranges varied greatly with input parameters and choice of ambient noise level. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Climate change; Fish; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Seawater; Ambient noise level; Frequencies characteristics; Standard visual surveys; Acoustic noise measurement; article; balaeno borealis; balaeno musculus; balaeno physalus; controlled study; environmental temperature; eubalaena japonica; frequency analysis; geographical variation (species); geography; Gulf stream; megaptera novoeangliae; noise; nonhuman; parameter; priority journal; seasonal variation; sound detection; species; United States; whale; winter; Acoustics; Alaska; Animals; Balaenoptera; Computer Simulation; Echolocation; Fin Whale; Humpback Whale; Models, Biological; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Seasons; Seawater; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean, JISAO

We recorded underwater behaviour of humpback whales in a northwest Atlantic feeding area using suction-cup attached, multi-sensor, acoustic tags (DTAGs). Here we describe the first recordings of click production associated with underwater lunges from baleen whales. Recordings of over 34 000 'megapclicks' from two whales indicated relatively low received levels at the tag (between 143 and 154 dB re 1 mPa pp), most energy below 2 kHz, and interclick intervals often decreasing towards the end of click trains to form a buzz. All clicks were recorded during night-time hours. Sharp body rolls also occurred at the end of click bouts containing buzzes, suggesting feeding events. This acoustic behaviour seems to form part of a night-time feeding tactic for humpbacks and also expands the known acoustic repertoire of baleen whales in general. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Acoustic behaviour; Baleen whale; Click; DTAG; Feeding; Northwest Atlantic","animal; article; echolocation; feeding behavior; humpback whale; orientation; physiology; sound detection; Animals; Echolocation; Feeding Behavior; Humpback Whale; Orientation; Sound Spectrography",,,,,,,"Arsenault, R., Ware, C., Plumlee, M., Martin, S., Whitcomb, L., Wiley, D., Gross, T., Bilgili, A., A system for visualizing time varying oceanographic 3D data (2004) Oceans, 2, pp. 743-747. , doi:10.1109/OCEANS.2004.1405535; Au, W.W.L., (1993) The Sonar of Dolphins, , New York, NY: Springer; Au, W.W.L., Frankel, A., Helweg, D.A., Cato, D.H., Against the humpback whale sonar hypothesis (2001) IEEE J.

We tracked humpback whales visually and acoustically during migration from the breeding grounds past our study site on the east coast of Australia (latitude 26°28′S). The mean swimming speed for whales while singing was 2.5 km/h, significantly less than for non-singing whales with a mean of 4.0 km/h but significantly greater than the mean of 1.6 km/h observed for singing whales on the Hawaiian breeding grounds. Between song sessions, there was no significant difference in speeds between whales that had been singing and other whales. Migration speeds were less for whales while singing but increased during the season. Although humpback whales can swim rapidly while singing (maximum observed 15.6 km/h), they generally do not do so, even during migration. Slower migration by singers would delay their return to the polar feeding areas and may be costly, but may be a strategy to provide access to more females. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Behavior; Cetacean; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Song; Swim speed; Vocalization","acoustic data; breeding site; migration; song; swimming behavior; tracking; visual analysis; vocalization; whale; Australasia; Australia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Seasonal contrasts in the social behavior of the humpback whale (1984) Cetus, 5, pp. 14-16. , and; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Population characteristics and migration of summer and late-season humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in southeastern Alaska (1985) Marine Mammal Science, 1, pp. 304-323. , and; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Herman, L.M., Reproductive histories of female humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the North Pacific (1987) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 41, pp. 103-114. , and; Best, P.B., Sekiguchi, K., Findlay, K.P., A suspended migration of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae on the west coast of South Africa (1995) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 118 (1-3), pp. 1-12. , and; Brown, M., Corkeron, P., Pod characteristics of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the east Australian coast (1995) Behaviour, 132 (3-4), pp. 163-179. , and; Cato, D.H., Recording humpback whale sounds off Stradbroke Island (1984) Focus on Stradbroke., pp. 285-290. , Pages. in.

We reconstructed cetacean phytogeny using a 1.7-kbp fragment of the non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY), including the SRY gene and a flanking non-coding region. The topology of the Y-chromosome tree is robust to various methods of analysis and exhibits high branch-support values, possibly due to the absence of recombination, small effective population size, and low homoplasy. The Y-chromosome tree indicates monophyly of each suborder, Mysticeti and Odontoceti, with high branch support values (BS≥86%; PP≥98%). In the Odontoceti clade, three super-families, Physeteroidea, Ziphioidea, and Delphinoidea, diverged soon after the split between Mysticeti and Odontoceti. Our analysis allows resolution of this rapid radiation and indicates that Physeteroidea is basal in the Odontoceti clade (BS, 99%; PP, 100%; MBS, 61%). The major split within the superfamily Delphinoidea is between the Delphinidae clade and the Monodontidae+ Phocoenidae clade. The phylogenetic relationships among delphinid species are ambiguous, probably because of the rapid radiation of this family. In the Mysticeti clade, the first major split is between Balaenidae and Balaenopteridae; within Balaenopteridae, a Balaenopfera acutorostrata+B. bonaerensis (minke whales) clade forms a sister clade with the other balaenopterid species. Megaptera novaeangliae is nested within Balaenoptera, making the latter paraphyletic. The low homoplasy exhibited by the Y-chromosome data presented here suggests that an extended data set incorporating longer sequences would provide better resolution of cetacean lower-level pylogeny. © 2007 Zoological Society of Japan.","Cetacea; Molecular phylogeny; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Paternal inheritance; Y chromosome","primer DNA; animal; animal disease; article; Cetacea; chemistry; classification; female; genetics; male; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; SRY gene; Y chromosome; Animals; Base Sequence; Cetacea; DNA Primers; Female; Genes, sry; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Y Chromosome; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monodontidae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Phocoenidae; Skenea","GENBANK: AB108509, AB108510, AB108511, AB108512, AB108513","DNA Primers",,,,,"Adachi, J., Hasegawa, M., Phylogeny of whales: Dependence of the inference on species sampling (1995) Mol Biol Evol, 12, pp. 177-179; Adegoke, J.A., Arnason, U., Widegren, B., Sequence organization and evolution, in all extant whalebone whales, of a DNA satellite with terminal chromosome localization (1993) Chromosoma, 102, pp. 382-388; Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans Automat Contr, 19, pp. 716-723; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Comparison between the complete mtDNA sequences of Blue whale and the Fin whale, two species that can hybridize in nature (1993) J Mol Evol, 37, pp. 312-322; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationship of baleen whales estab-lished by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Cytochrome b nucleotide sequences and idntification of five primary lineages of extant cetaceans (1996) Mol Biol Evol, 13, pp. 407-417; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two Sperm whale species (1993) Mol Biol Evol, 10, pp. 960-970; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 26, pp. 27-34; Avise, J.C., Wollenberg, K., Phylogenetics and the origin of species (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 94, pp. 7748-7755; Bachtrog, D., Evidence that positive selection drives Y-chromosome degeneration in Drosophila miranda (2004) Nat Genet, 36, pp. 518-522; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Population structure, molecular systematics, and forensic identification of whales and dolphins (1996) Conservation Genetics.

Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common bottle-nosed dolphin neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalu) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales. Similar structures were present in the corresponding cardiac tissues of neonatal Hippopotamidae. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Fetus; Heart; Hippopotamidae; Mysticeti; Neonate; Odontoceti; Whale","anatomical variation; animal tissue; article; Balaena mysticetus; balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; comparative anatomy; controlled study; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinus delphis; dolphin; fetus; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; heart atrium septum; heart foramen ovale; heart ventricle septum; Hyperoodon ampullatus; killer whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; microscopic anatomy; Monodon monoceros; Neophocoena phocoenoides; newborn; nonhuman; Phocoena phocoena; porpoise; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; species comparison; species difference; tursiops truncatus; whale; Animals; Cetacea; Common Dolphins; Female; Heart Septum; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Porpoises; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hippopotamidae; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Monodontidae; Mysticeti; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Odontoceti; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Amoroso, E.C., Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., Prichard, M.M.L., The bifurcation of the posterior caval channel in the eutherian foetal heart (1942) J Anat, 76, pp. 240-247; (2005) Out of the Blue: The UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme, , History Museum London; Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 333, pp. 27-34; Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., The time of functional closure of the foramen ovale in the lamb (1938) J Physiol, 94, pp. 256-258; Bartholin, T., (1654) Historiarum Anatomicarum Rariorum Centuriae II; Historia XXV, , Amstelodami; Beauregard, H., Boulart, R., Recherches anatomiques sur les Balænides (1897) Nouv Arch Mus Hist Nat Paris 3rd Ser, 9, pp. 95-112; Boisserie, J.R., The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): A review based on morphology and cladistic analysis (2005) Zool J Linn Soc, 143, pp. 1-26; Boyd, I.L., Lockyer, C., Marsh, H.D., Reproduction in marine mammals (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 218-286. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Burmeister, G., Descripcion de cuatro especies de delfinides de la costa Argentina en el océano atlántico (1869) An Mus Nac Hist Nat B Aires, 1, pp. 367-442; Butler, P.J., Metabolic regulation in diving birds and mammals (2004) Resp Physiol Neurobiol, 141, pp. 297-315; Cohen, A.L., Critical point drying principles and procedures (1979) Scanning Electron Microscopy, 1979 (2), pp. 303-323; Echlin, P., Splutter coating techniques for scanning electron microscopy (1975) Scanning Electron Microsc, 1975 (2), pp. 217-224; Edelstone, D.I., Rudolph, A.M., Preferential streaming of ductus venosus blood to the brain and heart in fetal lambs (1979) Am J Physiol, 237, pp. H724-H729; Elsner, R., Living in water: Solutions to physiological problems (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 73-116. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Eschricht, D.F., (1837) De Organis, Quae Respirationi Et Nutritioni Foetus Mammalium Inserviunt, , Hafniae: JH Schultz; Eschricht, D.F., Zoologisch-anatomisch-physiologische Untersuchungen über die nordischen Walthiere (1849), L.

We document seven individuals, including a mother/calf pair, that made this migration (approx. 8300 km), the longest movement undertaken by any mammal. Whales were observed as far north as 11° N off Costa Rica, in an area also used by a boreal population during the opposite winter season, resulting in unique spatial overlap between Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations. The occurrence of such a northerly wintering area is coincident with the development of an equatorial tongue of cold water in the eastern South Pacific, a pattern that is repeated in the eastern South Atlantic. A survey of location and water temperature at the wintering areas worldwide indicates that they are found in warm waters (21.1-28.3°C), irrespective of latitude. We contend that while availability of suitable reproductive habitat in the wintering areas is important at the fine scale, water temperature influences whale distribution at the basin scale. Calf development in warm water may lead to larger adult size and increased reproductive success, a strategy that supports the energy conservation hypothesis as a reason for migration. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Antarctica; Central America; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Sea-surface temperature","feeding; migration; reproductive success; sea surface temperature; whale; animal experiment; article; Central America; controlled study; female; geographic distribution; humpback whale; male; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; reproductive success; seasonal variation; temperature measurement; water temperature; animal; ecosystem; geography; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population migration; temperature; water flow; Antarctica; Central America; Costa Rica; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Animal Migration; Animals; Ecosystem; Geography; Humpback Whale; Pacific Ocean; Temperature; Water Movements",,,,,,,"Allen, J.M., Stevick, P.T., Carlson, C., The Antarctic Humpback Whale Catalogue: Description and summary (2006) Workshop on the Comprehensive Assessment of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, Hobart, Tasmania 4-7 April 2006, , Paper SC/A06/HW58 presented to the [Paper available from the International Whaling Commission, Cambridge, UK.]; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Can.

A barrier breach can be lethal, as asphyxiation may occur from incursions of water (drowning) or food (choking). Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), however, exhibit a possibly unique and paradoxical behavior concerning respiratory protection: they release a ""bubble cloud"" (a cluster of tiny bubbles) underwater from the mouth. How they do this remains unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that the larynx plays a role in enabling bubble cloud emission. The anatomy and position of the larynx was examined in seven specimens of Megaptera novaeangliae. Results indicate that the epiglottis can be manually removed from behind the soft palate and placed in the oral cavity during dissection. Unlike that of toothed whales (odontocetes), the humpback whale larynx does not appear to be permanently intranarial. The elongated and trough-shaped epiglottis may function as a tube when placed against the undersurface of the soft palate and, thus, facilitate channeling air from the larynx to the oral cavity. The pointed tip and lateral edges of the epiglottis fit tightly against the undersurface of the soft palate, perhaps functioning as a one-way valve that lets air out but prevents water from entering. Bubble cloud generation likely involves air passing directly from the larynx into the oral cavity, and then expulsion through the mesh of the baleen plates. A laryngeal-oral connection, however, compromises the anatomical aquatic adaptations that normally protect the respiratory tract. A potential for drowning exists during the critical interval in which the larynx is intraoral and during re-insertion back to the normal intranarial position. The retention of this risky behavior indicates the importance of bubble clouds in predator avoidance, prey capture, and/or social signaling. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Air release; Anatomy; Bubble; Cetacean; Cloud; Feeding; Humpback; Larynx; Mysticete; Net; Respiratory; Whale","water; animal anatomy; animal behavior; animal experiment; aquatic environment; article; breathing mechanics; dissection; epiglottis; female; larynx; male; Megaptera novaeangliae; mouth; mouth cavity; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory system; risk factor; soft palate; whale; Adaptation, Physiological; Air; Animals; Female; Humpback Whale; Larynx; Male; Predatory Behavior; Respiratory Physiology; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Odontoceti",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Can J Zool, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Cranford, T.W., Amundin, M., Norris, K., Functional morphology and homology in the odontocete nasal complex: Implications for sound generation (1996) J Morphol, 228, pp. 223-285; Croll, D.A., Tershy, B.R., Filter feeding (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 428-432. , Perrin WF, Würsig B, Thewissen JGM, editors, London: Academic Press. p; Hain, J.H.W., Carter, G.R., Kraus, S.D., Mayo, C.A., Winn, H.E., Feeding behavior of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the western North Atlantic (1982) Fish Bull, 80, pp. 259-268; Harrison, D.F.N., (1995) The anatomy and physiology of the mammalian larynx, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Jurasz, C.M., Jurasz, V.P., Feeding modes of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae in southeastern Alaska (1979) Sci Rep Whales Res Inst Tokyo, 31, pp. 69-84; Laitman, J.T., Reidenberg, J.S., Specializations of the human upper respiratory and upper digestive systems as seen through comparative and developmental anatomy (1993) Dysphagia, 8, pp. 318-325; Laitman, J.T., Reidenberg, J.S., The human aerodigestive tract and gastroesophageal reflux: An evolutionary perspective (1998) Am J Med, 103, pp. 3-11; Laitman, J.T., Reidenberg, J.S., Evolution of the vocal folds in cetaceans (1999) Eur Res Cetaceans, 12, pp. 286-289; Leighton, T.G., Richards, S.D., White, P.R., Trapped within a wall of sound (2004) Acoust Bull, 29, pp. 24-29; Leighton TG, White PR, Finfer DC, Richards SD. 2005.

The condition involved at least 11 vertebrae, 7 lumbar (L4 to L11) and 4 caudal (Ca1 to Ca4). Partial fusion of vertebrae was observed as a result of intervertebral bony proliferation, likely impeding full motion. The relatively young age of this specimen and the severity of the deformities suggest an infectious, rather than degenerative, process. The gross findings are most consistent with some type of spondyloarthritis.

J4P 1T3, Canada","Understanding the factors influencing habitat selection is critical to improving management and conservation plans for large whales. Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies.

During one-hour scans, observers determined group composition within 9.3 km around a land-based station. A total of 930 scans, comprising 4288 groups were analysed. Seven group categories were identified and their frequencies were 14.6% of 1AD (lone whale), 25.2% of DYAD (two adult whales), 7.3% of TRIO (three adult whales), 5.2 of TRIO+ (more than three adults), 24.9% of MOC (mother and calf), 19.6% of MOCE (mother, calf and one escort), and 3.1% of MOCE+ (mother, calf and more than one escort). Proportions of whale-group categories did not change between morning and afternoon, nor among years. However, as the season progressed, groups with calves increased while groups without calves decreased. This progression may be explained by the segregated migration patterns of humpback whales and also by changes in the social status of individuals. The Abrolhos Reef provides protection from the prevailing winds, which may explain the higher proportion of groups with calves in the area. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"breeding site; group size; migration; population structure; temporal distribution; whale; Bahia; Brazil; Houtman Abrolhos; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; South America; Cetacea; Cromileptes altivelis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of the humpback whale Megaptera nodosa (Bonaterre) (1965) Australian Journal of Marine Freshwater Research, 16, pp. 33-128; Craig, A.S., Herman, L.M., Gabriele, C.M., Pack, A.A., Migratory timing of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Central North Pacific varies with age, sex and reproductive status (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 981-1001; Craig, A.S., Herman, L.M., Pack, A.A., Male mate choice and male-male competition coexist in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2002) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 80, pp. 745-755; Dawbin, W.H., The seasonal migratory cycle of Humpback whales (1966) Whales, dolphins, and porpoises, pp. 145-170. , ed.

During three consecutive years of monthly acoustic surveys in Lynn Canal, southeastern Alaska, large schools of herring dominated during winter and were present in a 60-km long submarine gully; this gully appears to provide critical winter habitat for herring when their prey are less available and energy expenditure must be reduced. The salient change in pollock distribution is a shift from shallow waters during summer to deeper waters during winter, such that shallow (<40 m) waters are nearly devoid of pollock during winter. The shift presumably occurs in response to the build-up of secondary productivity during summer and predator avoidance during winter. The seasonal changes in herring abundance drove seasonal changes in predator abundance, as Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) preyed upon the winter aggregation of herring. Such seasonal links likely serve an important role in structuring trophic relationships in the North Pacific Ocean ecosystem.","Ecology; Forage fish; Pacific herring; Seasonality; Walleye pollock","abundance; fish; forage; seasonality; trophic interaction; Alaska; Lynn Canal; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Cetacea; Clupea pallasi; Clupeidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Pollachius virens; Theragra chalcogramma",,,,,,,"Bailey, K.M., Interaction between the vertical distribution of juvenile pollock Theragra chalcogramma in the eastern Bering Sea, and cannibalism (1989) Mar.

The objective was to collect sightings data for all cetacean species encountered to begin to collate information for a large-scale sightings database. Two observers employed standard-distance sampling techniques and visual observations (naked eye) to scan for cetaceans during daylight hours and favourable weather conditions. Approximately 112 h were spent surveying over 23 d. A total of 13 cetacean species were encountered, with 173 separate sightings recorded, totalling over 2000 animals. The most commonly sighted species were minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata: N=44), Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus: N=34, with group sizes of up to 600), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae: N=31). The distribution of minke whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins and fin whales was linked to underlying oceanographic variables. Overall patterns of distribution were consistent with our understanding of the summer distributions for the species encountered. The survey highlighted the cetacean diversity of the northern North Atlantic region. Repeat work using this methodology will allow an examination of species' distributions and estimation of their relative abundance. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"abundance; cetacean; data acquisition; monitoring; passenger ship; population distribution; species diversity; surveying; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Dietz, R., Teilmann, J., Heide-Jorgensen, M., Jensen, M.K., Satellite tracking of humpback whales in West Greenland (2002) NERI Technical Report, , No. 411, National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark; Evans, P.G.H., Hammond, P.S., Monitoring cetaceans in European waters (2004) Mammal Review, 34, pp. 131-156; Kapel, F.O. & F.

At 15°58′S 005°43′W, the island of St Helena is one of the few areas of land within this region and the only one that lies in the tropical south-eastern Atlantic. As a result, St Helena offers a unique opportunity to study cetaceans within this area using small boats and land-based observations. This paper describes the results of a preliminary, short-term survey of the cetacean community around St Helena in the austral winter of 2003. Pan-tropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) were the most numerous species recorded, followed by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), a species not previously reported from St Helena. This last species was only recorded occurring in mixed groups with bottlenose dolphins. Pan-tropical spotted and bottlenose dolphins differed in their spatial distribution around St Helena. While pan-tropical spotted dolphins were primarily recorded resting in large groups in the lee of the island during daylight hours, bottlenose dolphins and rough-toothed dolphins were recorded closer to shore and on both the windward and lee sides. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were also recorded once during the survey, but interviews with local fishermen suggest that this species regularly occurs in the waters around St Helena in small numbers during the austral winter. The results of this preliminary survey suggest that the cetacean community around St Helena during this survey was relatively simple, consisting of up to three species that are present year-round and one seasonally occurring species in the nearshore waters, with a small number of additional species occurring occasionally in deeper offshore areas. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"community structure; dolphin; monitoring; population distribution; species occurrence; tropical environment; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southeast); Saint Helena; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Ashmole, P., Ashmole, M., (2000) St Helena and Ascension Island: A natural history, , Shropshire, UK: Anthony Nelson; Edwards, A., (1990) Fish and fisheries of Saint Helena Island, , Saint Helena Government and University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle, UK; Martins, C.C.A., Morete, M.E., Engel, M.H., Frietas, A.C., Secchie, E.R., Kinas, P.G., Aspects of habitat use patterns of humpback whales in the Abrolhos Bank, Brazil, breeding ground (2002) Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, 47, pp. 563-570; Perrin, W.F., The former dolphin fishery at St Helena (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 423-428; Walsh, P.D., Fay, J.M., Gulick, S., Sounguest, G.P., Humpback whale activity near Cap Lopez, Gabon (2000) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 2, pp. 63-67","MacLeod, C.D.; School of Biological Sciences (Zoology), University of Aberdeen, Tillydrone Avenue, Aberdeen, AB24 2TZ, United Kingdom; email: c.d.macleod@abdn.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00253154,,JMBAA,,"English","J.

However, whaling logbooks of 19th century whalers show almost no records of catches in some regions of current concentration, notably eastern Polynesia, suggesting that humpback whales were formerly absent from these regions or that the locations of their primary concentrations were unknown to early whalers. Here we investigate the population structure of humpback whales across the South Pacific and eastern Indian oceans, with an interest in the origins of whales in eastern Polynesia, using an extensive collection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences obtained from living whales on 6 breeding grounds: New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, eastern Polynesia (Society Islands of French Polynesia), Colombia and Western Australia. From a total of 1112 samples we sequenced 470 bp of the mtDNA control region, revealing 115 unique haplotypes identified by 71 variable sites. We found significant differentiation, at both the haplotype and nucleotide level (FST = 0.033; ΦST = 0.022), among the 6 breeding grounds and for most pair-wise comparisons. The differentiation of the eastern Polynesia humpback whales is consistent with the hypothesis of a relic subpopulation, rather than vagrancy or colonization from known neighboring breeding grounds. Regardless of their origin, it seems probable that islands of eastern Polynesia are now the primary breeding grounds for humpback whales feeding in management Area VI (170 to 120° W) of the Antarctic, as defined by the International Whaling Commission. © Inter-Research 2007.","Indian Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae; mtDNA; Oceania; Stock structure; Whaling","breeding site; colonization; migration route; mitochondrial DNA; population structure; subpopulation; whale; Australasia; Australia; Colombia; Cook Islands; Indian Ocean; Melanesia; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Polynesia; South America; Tonga; Western Australia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Medrano-González, L., World-wide distribution and diversity of humpback whale mitochondrial DNA lineages (2002) Molecular and cell biology of marine mammals, pp. 84-99. , Pfeiffer CJ ed, Krieger Publishing, Melbourne, FL, p; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on the distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Weinrich, M.T., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and worldwide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 90, pp. 8239-8243; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.W., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, world-wide (1994) Mol Ecol, 3, pp. 313-327; Baker, C.S., Flórez-González, L., Abernethy, B., Rosenbaum, H.C., Slade, R.W., Capella, J., Bannister, J.L., Mitochondrial DNA variation and maternal gene flow among humpback whales of the southern hemisphere (1998) Mar Mamm Sci, 14, pp. 721-737; Bannister, J.L., Hedley, S.L., Southern hemisphere group IV humpback whales: Their status from recent aerial survey (2001) Mem Queensl Mus, 47, pp. 587-598; Beale, T., (1839) The natural history of the sperm whale and South-Sea whaling voyage, , The Holland Press, London; Brown, M., Burt, L., Distribution of humpback whales sightings from IWC/IDR surveys, Annex G, Appendix 2 (1998) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 48, p. 179; Brown, M.R., Corkeron, P.J., Hale, P.T., Schultz, K.W., Bryden, M.M., Evidence for a sex segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proc R Soc Lond B, 259, pp. 229-234; Bullen, F.T., (1902) The cruise of the 'Cachalot' round the world after sperm whales, , MacMillan, London; Caballero, S., Hamilton, H., Jaramillo, C., Capella, J., Genetic characterisation of the Colombian pacific coast humpback whale population using RAPD and mitochondrial DNA sequences (2001) Mem Queensl Mus, 47, pp. 459-464; Chapman, D.G., Status of Antarctic rorqual stocks (1974) The whale problem, pp. 218-238. , Schevill WE ed, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, p; Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski) (1965) Aust J Mar Freshw Res, 16, pp. 33-128; Clapham, P.J., Baker, C.S., Whaling, modern (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 1328-1332. , Perrin WF, Wursig B, Thewissen JGM eds, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, p; Dawbin, W.H., The seasonal migratory cycle of humpback whales (1966) Whales, dolphins, and porpoises, pp. 145-171. , Norris KS ed, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, p; Donovan, G.P., A review of IWC stock boundaries (1991) Hoelzel AR (ed) Report of the International Whaling Commission Special Issue, 13, pp. 39-68. , International Whaling Commission, Cambridge, p; Excoffier, L., Smouse, P.E., Quattro, J.M., Analysis of molecular variance inferred from metric distances among DNA haplotypes: Application to human mitochondrial DNA restriction data (1992) Genetics, 131, pp. 479-491; Garrigue, C., Aguayo, A., Amante-Helweg, V.L.U., Baker, C.S., Movements of humpback whales in Oceania, South Pacific (2002) J Cetacean Res Manage, 4, pp. 255-260; Garrigue, C., Dodemont, R., Steel, D., Baker, C.S., Organismal and 'gametic' capture-recapture using microsatellite genotyping confirm low abundance and reproductive autonomy of humpback whales on the wintering grounds of New Caledonia (2004) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 274, pp. 251-262; Gibbs N, Paton DA, Childerhouse S, Clapham P (2006) Assessment of the current abundance of humpback whales in the Lomaiviti Island Group of Fiji and a comparison with historical data.

Whereas brain structure has been documented in detail in some odontocetes, few reports exist on its organization in mysticetes. We studied the cerebral cortex of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in comparison to another balaenopterid, the fin whale, and representative odontocetes. We observed several differences between Megaptera and odontocetes, such as a highly clustered organization of layer II over the occipital and inferotemporal neocortex, whereas such pattern is restricted to the ventral insula in odontocetes. A striking observation in Megaptera was the presence in layer V of the anterior cingulate, anterior insular, and frontopolar cortices of large spindle cells, similar in morphology and distribution to those described in hominids, suggesting a case of parallel evolution. They were also observed in the fin whale and the largest odontocetes, but not in species with smaller brains or body size. The hippocampal formation, unremarkable in odontocetes, is further diminutive in Megaptera, contrasting with terrestrial mammals. As in odontocetes, clear cytoarchitectural patterns exist in the neocortex of Megaptera, making it possible to define many cortical domains. These observations demonstrate that Megaptera differs from Odontoceti in certain aspects of cortical cytoarchitecture and may provide a neuromorphologic basis for functional and behavioral differences between the suborders as well as a reflection of their divergent evolution. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Balaenopterids; Cetaceans; Cytoarchitecture; Dolphins; Mysticete; Neocortex; Odontocete","animal tissue; article; Balaenoptera; brain cortex; brain region; Cetacea; controlled study; echolocation; female; humpback whale; mammal; Megaptera novaeangliae; nonhuman; priority journal; spindle cell; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Dolphins; Evolution; Female; Fin Whale; Humpback Whale; Male; Neocortex; Neurons; Porpoises; Pyramidal Cells; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Hominidae; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti",,,,,,,"Allman, J.M., Watson, K.K., Tetreault, N.A., Hakeem, A.Y., Intuition and autism: A possible role for Von Economo neurons (2005) Trends Cogn Sci, 9, pp. 367-373; Baldauf, Z., SMI-32 parcellates the visual cortical areas of the marmoset (2005) Neurosci Lett, 383, pp. 109-114; Barnes LG, Domming DP, Ray CE. 1985.

This is the most important collection existing in Italy for the number of taxa being included (27), seven of them being the sole present in Italian museums. Noteworthy are the skeletons of some large size species, among which the Blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus) and the Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis ) are the sole complete ones existing in Italy in addition to the adults of the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the Northern right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis). The collection must also be appreciated for several exotic species. The 53 skeletons here stored were mostly acquired during the XIX Century, thanks to prof. Sebastiano Richiardi, director of the Institute from 1871 to 1904, and increased from his successor, prof. Eugenio Ficalbi from 1905 to1922. This catalogue has been compiled throughout a long term study begun in 1984 and concluded only several years later, after the transfer of the collection to its present seat: as a matter of fact, an accurate revision of the conditions of the specimens was essential after the move and the final layout. At the same time, a wide documental research was run on the archivial historical sources, concerning the acquisition of the specimens, with many original information on the long history of the building of the collection; detailed data on the costs of several purchasing contracts are also reported. The catalogue lists each specimen in systematic order, with its taxonomic references and description of the fundamental osteometrical parameters. Specific bibliography concerning every specimen of the collection is also shown. © 2007, Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali.

T6R 3H8, Canada; Yang, D.Y., Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Two modes of whale use have been documented on the Northwest Coast of North America, namely systematic whale hunting and whale scavenging. Ethnographically, systematic hunting was practiced only by Native groups of southwestern Vancouver Island and the northern Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. This hunting was undertaken with technology specifically designed for the task. Other groups on the Northwest Coast reportedly did not hunt whales but did utilize beached animals. Here we present archaeological evidence of whaling from the northern Oregon coast site of Par-Tee in the form of a bone point lodged in a whale phalange. This hunting likely occurred 1,300 to 1,600 years ago. Ancient DNA extracted from the phalange proves it to be a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). DNA recovered from the bone point indicates that it is made from elk (Cervus elaphus) bone, and the point's DNA sequence is identical to that from unmodified elk bone from Par-Tee, suggesting the whale was locally hunted. We present ethnohistoric data from the southern Northwest Coast describing opportunistic whale hunting with a variety of technologies. We argue that many groups along the west coast of North America likely occasionally hunted whales in the past and that this hunting occurred using nonspecialized technologies.

In light of the exclusive ectoparasitism of Coronula on whales and mainly on humpback whales, we infer that during the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene the Canoa Basin was on the seasonal migration route of these cetaceans and that whales remained in the Canoa Basin for sufficient time (breeding?) for large accumulations of Coronula to form. Support for this hypothesis comes from current use of this part of the Ecuadorian coast as a breeding ground for Megaptera and from a rib fragment of ?Megaptera from the Coronula-rich Tablazo Formation. Indirect palaeoclimatic implications may be derived from this as humpback whales require at least 25 °C for breeding. Thus, in the Late Pliocene and the Pleistocene, the Humboldt Current apparently had a northern extension similar to the present, with a 25 °C summer isotherm in the same latitudinal position along the Ecuador coast as today. On the basis of preservation, it is concluded that the Coronula-bearing molluscan shell beds in the Canoa and Tablazo Formations are of two basic types: biogenic and sedimentologic. Coronula shells deposited in the biogenic shell beds are little affected by physical processes (fragmentation, peeling, edge preservation), while modified by biological processes like bioerosion and encrustation. The exterior and interior surfaces of the shells display a variety of bioerosional features and encrusting taxa including barnacles, serpulid polychaetes, small oysters and bryozoans indicating that they were deposited during periods of sedimentary quiescence. In comparison, Coronula that accumulated within sedimentologic concentrations are typically heavily abraded and highly fragmented with little or no encrustation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Morphometric data from whaling records and recent stranding events were compiled, and morphometric parameters describing the body length, and fluke and flipper dimensions for an ""average"" blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, and right whale Eubalaena glacialis were determined. Body mass, body volume, body surface area, and fluke and flipper surface areas were estimated. The resultant morphological configurations lent themselves to the following classifications based on hydrodynamic principles: fast cruiser, slow cruiser, fast maneuverer, and slow maneuverer. Blue whales have highly stream-lined bodies with small, high aspect ratio flippers and flukes for fast efficient cruising in the open ocean. On the other hand, the rotund right whale has large, high aspect ratio flukes for efficient slow speed cruising that is optimal for their continuous filter feeding technique. Humpbacks have large, high aspect ratio flippers and a large, low aspect ratio tail for quick acceleration and high-speed maneuvering which would help them catch their elusive prey, while gray whales have large, low aspect ratio flippers and flukes for enhanced low-speed maneuvering in complex coastal water habitats. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cetacean; Feeding ecology; Functional morphology; Mysticete; Swim performance","adaptation; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; feeding behavior; histology; locomotion; physiology; predation; swimming; whale; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Locomotion; Models, Anatomic; Predatory Behavior; Swimming; Whales; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; Andrews, R.C., Notes upon the external and internal anatomy of Balaena glacialis Bonn (1908) Bull Am Mus Nat Hist, 24, pp. 171-182; Andrews, R.C., Monograph of the pacific cetacean California gray whale (1914) Mem Am Mus Nat Hist, 1, pp. 229-287; Benke, H., Investigations on the osteology and functional morphology of the flipper of whales and dolphins (Cetacea) (1993) Investig Cetacea, 24, pp. 9-252; Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (SPEC.

Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (B. acutorostrata) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and 6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As Korea has no programme of commercial or scientific whaling and there is a closure on the hunting of dolphins and porpoises, the only legal source of these products was assumed to be incidental fisheries mortalities ('bycatch') as reported by the government to the International Whaling Commission. Species identification of 357 products using mitochondrial DNA control region or cytochrome b sequences and the web-based programme DNA-surveillance revealed three species of baleen whales (North Pacific minke, common form Bryde's and humpback), three species of beaked whales (Cuvier's, Stejneger's and Blainville's), seven species of dolphins (short-finned pilot, false killer and killer whales; Risso's, bottlenose, common and Pacific white-sided dolphins) and two species of porpoises (harbour and finless). Comparison of market products with official records revealed a number of discrepancies. Of the eight species identified on the markets in 2003, three were not reported in official records for that year. Of the 11 species identified in 2004, five were not reported as bycatch, although one species, a humpback whale, was reported as 'stranded'. We also found significant inconsistencies in the expected frequencies of products from most species, including a large over-representation of finless porpoises and false killer whales. We suggest ways in which market surveys could be improved to provide better information on the magnitude of fisheries bycatch and other illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) exploitation of wildlife. © 2006 The Zoological Society of London.","Cetaceans; International Whaling Commission; Molecular taxonomy; Whalemeat","bycatch; cetacean; hunting; species conservation; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Phocoenidae; Pseudorca; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"South Koreans caught in the act (1994) New Sci., 142, p. 4. , Anonymous; (1994) Whale Meat Management in Japan.

We analysed the results from an intensive 2-year ocean-basin-scale investigation resulting in 1658 individuals identified by natural markings and 751 individuals by genetic markers supplemented with data from a long-term collaborative study with 3063 individuals identified by natural markings. Re-sighting distances ranged from &lt;1 km to &gt;2200 km. The frequencies (F) of re-sighting distances (D) observed in consecutive years were best modelled by an inverse allometric function (F=6631D-1.24, r2=0.984), reflecting high levels of site fidelity (median re-sighting distance &lt;40 km) with occasional long-distance movement (5% of re-sightings &gt;550 km). The distribution of re-sighting distances differed east and west of 45°W, with more long-distance movement in the east. This difference is consistent with regional patterns of prey distribution and predictability. Four feeding aggregations were identified: the Gulf of Maine, eastern Canada, West Greenland and the eastern North Atlantic. There was an exchange rate of 0.98% between the western feeding aggregations. The prevalence of long-distance movement in the east made delineation of possible additional feeding aggregations less clear. Limited exchange between sites separated by as little as tens of kilometres produced lower-level structuring within all feeding aggregations. Regional and temporal differences in movement patterns reflected similar foraging responses to varying patterns of prey availability and predictability. A negative relationship was shown between relative abundance of herring and sand lance in the Gulf of Maine and humpback whale movement from the Gulf of Maine to eastern Canada. © 2006 The Authors.","Foraging; Movement; Site fidelity","delamination; feeding ground; foraging behavior; genetic marker; population structure; spatial distribution; vertical movement; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Greenland; Gulf of Maine; North America; Ammodytes marinus; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Allen, J.M., Rosenbaum, H.C., Katona, S.K., Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Regional and sexual differences in fluke pigmentation of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from the North Atlantic Ocean (1994) Can.

The purpose of this study was to describe the behaviour and interactions of singers and, within this context, hypothesize song function. A sample of 167 singer interactions was collected from 1997-2002 off Maui, Hawaii. Singers typically: (1) were lone adults (80%); (2) sang until joined by non-singing males (89%), at least some of which had been neighbouring singers; (3) engaged in brief interactions (80% <10 minutes); otherwise the pair stayed together until a subsequent interaction; (4) were involved in non-agonistic interactions (80%); and (5) were involved in series of such interactions across the breeding ground (documented in 25% of sample) which could lead to one or more of the interacting males joining a group that included a female (documented in 13% of sample). A singer-joiner interaction proceeded directly to apparent cooperative behaviour around a female in two cases; this relationship was not ruled out in similar interactions. The two key elements of male behaviour during the breeding season are a song that unites males, but changes collectively and a wide range of male relationships that range from agonistic, to non-agonistic, to cooperative. We hypothesize that the song organizes males by providing, through its characteristics of continuous change and adoption of these changes by all nearby singers, a real time measure of association between individuals, possibly providing a means of reciprocity for mutual assistance in mating. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2006.","Competitive; Cooperative; Mating; Megaptera novaeangliae; Song","Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Au, W.W., Mobley, L.J., Burgess, W.C., Lammers, M.O., Nachtigall, P.E., Seasonal and diurnal trends of chorusing humpback whales wintering in waters off western Maui (2000) Mar.

Cooperative behaviours are exhibited during feeding activities, and it has been suggested that males may cooperate during competition for mates. Since most cooperative behaviours are expected to originate among kin, genetic relatedness represents a critical variable in the understanding of any social phenomenon, especially when cooperation cannot be confirmed unequivocally. Using an approach combining multi-locus microsatellite genotyping and several genetic relatedness estimators, we analyzed whale associations for two different wintering grounds in the Southern Hemisphere. The analyses included 648 whales sampled from 292 groups off the coast of Gabon and Northeast Madagascar, and screened for eleven microsatellite loci. Through simulations, we assessed the performance of three pairwise relatedness estimators. The individuals were molecularly sexed and their associations were investigated in the context of sex and group type. No significant association among relatives was found with the exception of mother-offspring pairs, supporting previous indications of extended maternal care. The analysis from the Gabon population also suggests that related males may avoid each other during competitive activities. Our results demonstrate that if cooperative behaviours occur on wintering grounds they are not favoured by kin selection. © 2006 The Authors.","Genotyping error; Humpback whales; Kinship; Megaptera novaeangliae; Microsatellites; Relatedness","microsatellite DNA; animal; article; cold; female; Gabon; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; humpback whale; Madagascar; male; mother; pedigree; physiology; population dynamics; season; Animals; Cold; Female; Gabon; Genotype; Humpback Whale; Madagascar; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Mothers; Pedigree; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Variation (Genetics); Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Alexander, R.D., The evolution of social behavior (1974) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 5, pp. 325-383; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Ayres, K.L., Overall, D.J., API-CALC 1.0: A computer program for calculating the average probability of identity allowing for substructure, inbreeding and the presence of close relatives (2004) Molecular Ecology Notes, 4, pp. 315-318; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Seasonal contrasts in the behavior of the humpback whale (1984) Cetus, 5, pp. 14-16; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Herman, L.M., Reproductive histories of female humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the North Pacific (1987) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 41, pp. 103-114; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and world-wide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 90, pp. 8239-8243; Baker, C.S., Weinrich, M.T., Early, G., Palumbi, S.R., Genetic impact of an unusual group mortality among humpback whales (1994) Journal of Heredity, 85, pp. 52-54; Belkhir, K., Castric, V., Bonhomme, F., IDENTIX, a software to test for relatedness in a population using permutation methods (2002) Molecular Ecology Notes, 2, pp. 611-614; Best, P.B., Social organization in sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus (1979) Behavior of Marine Animals, Vol 3: Cetaceans, 3, pp. 227-289. , eds Winn HE, Olla BL, Plenum Press, New York; Best, P.B., Schaeff, C.M., Reeb, D., Palsbøll, P.J., Composition and possible function of social groupings of Southern right whales in South African waters (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 1469-1494; Bigg, M.A., Olesiuk, P.F., Ellis, G.M., Ford, J.K.B., Balcomb, K.C., Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State (1990) Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 12, pp. 383-405; Bonin, A., Bellemain, E., Bronken Eidesen, P., How to track and assess genotyping errors in population genetics studies (2004) Molecular Ecology, 13, pp. 3261-3273; Brown, M., Corkeron, P., Pod characteristics of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the East Australian coast (1995) Behaviour, 132, pp. 163-179; Chapman, D.G., Status of Antarctic rorqual stocks (1974) The Whale Problem, pp. 218-238. , ed.

Physical forcing greatly affects productivity, recruitment, survival and distribution of krill in this area. In turn, such interactions are likely to affect the distribution of baleen whales. The Southern Ocean GLOBEC research program aims to explore the relationships and interactions between the environment, krill and predators around Marguerite Bay (WAP) in autumn 2001 and 2002. Bathymetric and environmental variables including acoustic backscattering as an indicator of prey abundance were used to model whale distribution patterns. We used an iterative approach employing (1) classification and regression tree (CART) models to identify oceanographic and ecological variables contributing to variability in humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke Balaenoptera acutorstrata whale distribution, and (2) generalized additive models (GAMs) to elucidate functional ecological relationships between these variables and whale distribution. The CART models indicated that the cetacean distribution was tightly coupled with zooplankton acoustic volume backscatter in the upper (25 to 100 m), and middle (100 to 300 m) portions of the water column. Whale distribution was also related to distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope. The GAMs indicated a persistent, strong, positive relationship between increasing zooplankton volume and whale relative abundance. Furthermore, there was a lower limit for averaged acoustic volume backscatter of zooplankton below which the relationship between whales and prey was not significant. The GAMs also supported an annual relationship between whale distribution, distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope, suggesting that these are important features for aggregating prey. Our results demonstrate that during the 2 yr study, whales were consistently and predictably associated with the distribution of zooplankton. Thus, humpback and minke whales may be able to locate physical features and oceanographic processes that enhance prey aggregation. © Inter-Research 2006.","Antarctica; CART; GAM; Ice edge; SO GLOBEC;

As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with <1 % of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models. © Inter-Research 2006.","Distribution; GIS; Global; Habitat suitability modeling; Marine mammals; Niche model; Relative environmental suitability","cetacean; environmental modeling; habitat use; mapping; marine ecosystem; pinniped; population distribution; range expansion; taxonomy; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Angel, M.V., Long-term, large-scale patterns in marine pelagic systems (1992) Proceedings of the 34th Symposium of the British Ecological Society with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, pp. 377-402. , Giller PS, Hildrew AG, Raffaelli DG (eds) Aquatic ecology: scale, pattern and process.

A detailed analysis of this feeding behavior has not been previously reported, nor has it been compared with the documented predatory feeding habits of this species. On 9 October 2000 we observed and photographed three white sharks scavenging on the carcass of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) near Point Reyes, California. The sharks most often fed individually; however, simultaneous feeding by two white sharks was observed. The sharks targeted the outer blubber layer of the carcass, avoiding previously exposed muscle tissue. Ocular rotation and palatoquadrate protrusion, behaviors commonly associated with white shark predations, were not observed. The significance of these behaviors are discussed and contrasted with the reported predatory feeding behaviors of this species.",,"feeding behavior; scavenging (feeding); shark; whale; California; North America; Point Reyes; United States; Carcharodon carcharias; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Lamnidae; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Strong, C.S., Huber, H.R., Lewis, T.J., Morrell, S.H., Predation by sharks on pinnipeds at the Farallon Islands (1981) Fishery Bulletin, 78, pp. 941-945; Ainley, D.G., Henderson, R.P., Huber, H.R., Boekelheide, R.J., Allen, S.G., McElroy, T.L., Dynamics of white shark/pinniped interactions in the Gulf of the Farallones (1985) Southern California Academy of Sciences, 9, pp. 109-122. , Memoirs; Bianucci, G., Bisconti, M., Landini, W., Storai, T., Zuffa, M., Giuliani, S., Mojetta, A., Trophic interaction between white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, and cetaceans: A comparison between Pliocene and recent data from Central Mediterranean Sea (2000) Proceedings of the 4th European Elasmobranch Association Meeting, pp. 33-48. , Livorno (Italy); Carey, F.G., Kanwisher, J.W., Brazier, O., Gabrielson, G., Casey, J.G., Pratt, H.L., Temperature and activities of a white shark, Carcharodon carcharias (1982) Copeia, 1982, pp. 254-260; Dudley, S.F.J., Anderson-Reade, M.D., Thompson, G.S., McMullen, P.B., Concurrent scavenging off a whale carcass by great white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier (2000) Fishery Bulletin, 98, pp. 646-649; Ellis, R., Tne book of sharks (1975), Grosset and Dunlap, New York, New York, USA; Goldman, K.J., Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, Carcharodon carcharias (1997) Journal of Comparative Physiology B, 167, pp. 423-429; Heithaus, M.R., Predator-prey and competitive interactions between sharks (order Selachii) and dolphins (order Odontoceti): A review (2001) Journal of Zoology: Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 253, pp. 53-68; Kelly, J.T., Klimley, A.P., The occurrence of the white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, at the Point Reyes Headlands, California (2003) California Fish and Game, 89 (4), pp. 187-196; Klimley, A.P., The areal distribution and autoecology of the white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, off the westcoast of North America (1985) Southern California Academy of Sciences, 9, pp. 15-40. , Memoirs; Klimley, A.P., LeBoeuf, B.J., Cantara, K.M., Richert, J.E., Davis, S.F., Van Sommeran, S., Kelly, J.T., The hunting strategy of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) near a seal colony (2001) Marine Biology, 138, pp. 617-636; Klimley, A.P., Pyle, P., Anderson, S.D., Tail slap and breach: Agonistic displays, among white sharks?

It has been hypothesized that the population wintering off eastern South America migrates to feeding grounds near the Antarctic Peninsula (ca. 65° S, 60° W) and/or South Georgia (54° 20' S, 36° 40' W), but direct evidence to support this has never been presented. Between 19 and 28 October 2003, 11 humpback whales (7 females and 4 males) were instrumented with satellite transmitters off Brazil (ca. 18° 30' S, 39° 30' W) to investigate their movements and migratory destinations. Mean tracking time for the whales was 39.6 d (range = 5 to 205 d) and mean distance travelled was 1673 km per whale (range = 60 to 7258 km). Movements on the wintering ground showed marked individual variation. Departure dates from the Brazilian coast ranged from late October to late December. Whales migrated south through oceanic waters at an average heading of 170° and travelled a relatively direct, linear path from wintering to feeding grounds. Two whales were tracked to feeding grounds in offshore areas near South Georgia and in the South Sandwich Islands (58° S, 26° W) after a 40 to 60 d long migration.

Here we test the hypothesis that, despite the apparent absence of close kinship bonds, the fluid associations between feeding whales are influenced by ""maternal lineages"" as represented by mtDNA haplotypes. Using skin samples collected with a biopsy dart, variation in the hypervariable segment of the mtDNA control region identified 17 unique haplotypes among 159 individually identified whales from the southern Gulf of Maine. The haplotypes of a further 143 individuals were inferred from known direct maternal (cow-calf) relationships. The frequencies of associations among these 302 individuals were calculated from 21,617 sighting records collected from 1980 to 1995, excluding associations between a cow and her dependent calf. For groups of two where the haplotypes of both individuals were known (n = 3,151), individuals with the same haplotype were together significantly more often (26%) than expected by random association (20%). To account for different group sizes and associations with individuals of unknown haplotype and sex, we used Monte Carlo simulations to test for nonrandom associations in the full data set, as well as known female-only (n = 1,512), male-only (n = 730), and mixed-sex (n = 2,745) groups. Within-haplotype associations were significantly more frequent than expected at random for all groups (P = .002) and female-only groups (P = .011) but not male-only groups, while mixed-sex groups approached significance (P = .062). A Mantel test of individual pairwise association indices and haplotype identity confirmed that within-haplotype associations were more frequent than expected for all sex combinations except male-male associations, with females forming within-haplotype associations 1.7 times more often than expected by random assortment. Partial matrix correlations and permutation analyses indicated that the skew toward within-haplotype associations could not be accounted for by short-term temporal co-occurrence or fine-scale spatial distributions of individuals with shared haplotypes. While the mechanism by which individuals with a common mtDNA haplotype assort remains unknown, our results strongly suggest an influence of maternal lineages on the social organization of humpback whales within a regional feeding ground. © The American Genetic Association. 2006.

Amplification of the DQB exon 2 provided sequences showing high within-species and between-species nucleotide diversity and uninterrupted reading frames consistent with functional class II loci found in related mammals (e.g., ruminants). Cloning of amplified products indicated gene duplication in the humpback whale and triplication in the southern right whale, with average nucleotide diversity of 5.9 and 6.3%, respectively, for alleles of each species. Significantly higher nonsynonymous divergence at sites coding for peptide binding (32% for humpback and 40% for southern right) suggested that these loci were subject to positive (overdominant) selection. A population survey of humpback whales detected 23 alleles, differing by up to 21% of their inferred amino acid sequences. Amplification of the DRB exon 2 resulted in two groups of sequences. One was most similar to the DRB3 of the cow and present in all whales screened to date, including toothed whales. The second was most similar to the DRB2 of the cow and was found only in the bowhead and right whales. Both loci showed low diversity among species and apparent loss of function or altered function including interruption of reading frames. Finally, comparison of inferred protein sequence of the DRB3-like locus suggested convergence with the DQB, perhaps resulting from intergenic conversion or recombination. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Cetaceans; Diversity; Dolphins; Overdominant selection","HLA antigen class 2; HLA DQ antigen; HLA DR antigen; allele; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; baleen whale; bowhead whale; cattle; convergent evolution; DQB like gene; DRB like gene; gene; gene amplification; gene conversion; gene disruption; gene duplication; gene function; gene loss; genetic recombination; genetic selection; genetic similarity; genetic variability; humpback whale; major histocompatibility complex; molecular cloning; Mysticeti; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; protein binding; southern right whale; species comparison; suborder; taxonomic rank; toothed whale; whale; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Evolution; Gene Duplication; Genes, MHC Class II; HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DR Antigens; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Variation (Genetics); Whales; Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Bos taurus; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha","GENBANK: DQ354623, DQ354624, DQ354625, DQ354626, DQ354627, DQ354628, DQ354629, DQ354630, DQ354631, DQ354632, DQ354633, DQ354634, DQ354635, DQ354636, DQ354637, DQ354638, DQ354639, DQ354640, DQ354641, DQ354642, DQ354643, DQ354644, DQ354645, DQ354646, DQ354647, DQ354648, DQ354649, DQ354650, DQ354651, DQ354652, DQ354653, DQ354654, DQ354655, DQ354656, DQ354657, DQ354658, DQ354659, DQ354660, DQ354661, DQ354662, DQ354663, DQ354664, DQ354665, DQ354666, DQ354667, DQ354668, DQ354669, DQ354670, DQ354671, DQ354672, DQ354673, DQ354674, DQ354675, DQ354676, DQ354677, DQ354678, DQ354679, DQ354680, DQ354681, DQ354682, DQ354683, DQ354684, DQ354685, DQ354686, DQ354687, DQ354688, DQ354689","HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DR Antigens",,,,"Acknowledgements This study was supported by a grant to CSB, GML, and SJO from the Marsden Fund of New Zealand.

A line passing over the leading edge of a fluke specimen was fixed at one end while the other end was loaded in an oscillatory manner. A 24-h abrasion test using an accelerated loading rate of 60 cycles/min and a 9.0-kg load on the fixed end of the most abrasive line tested (old sink line) was used to simulate a whale swimming 2 m/s towing four standard lobster buoys for five days. A tension load of 267 N was generated on the oscillatory side of the fluke. The test line failed to break the skin on the fluke but, instead, produced a compression furrow (maximum depth 0.31 cm) that closely resembled marks found on stranded right (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. Different line types (float vs. sink) and ages of rope (new vs. old) produced furrows of varying depths and appearances. Further tests characterizing whale skin/fishing line interactions will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern entanglement injuries and provide a framework for better forensic analysis and interpretation of gear-related injuries observed in large whales. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Cetacean; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Humpback whale; Injury; Megaptera novaeangliae; Modeling; Right whale","fishing gear; injury; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Barco, S.G.W.A., McLellan, J.M., Allen, R.A., Asmutis-Silvia, R., Mallon-Day, E.M., Meagher, D.A., Pabst, J., Clapham, J.P., Population identity of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the waters of the US mid-Atlantic states (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 135-141; Caswell, H.M., Fujiwara, Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Fung, Y.C., (1981) Biomechanics.

Sighting detection functions are estimated from this and other NOAA research surveys from 1986 to 2002 using a new, multiple-covariate approach. Twenty-four species were seen on this survey, including two species (Fraser's dolphin [Lagenodelphis hosei] and sei whale [Balaenoptera borealis]) that had not been previously documented to occur in Hawaiian waters. The most abundant large whales are sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The most abundant delphinids are pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), Fraser's dolphins, spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and Kogia breviceps) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are also estimated to be quite abundant. Some of the migratory baleen whales (fin whales [Balaenoptera physalus], sei whales, minke whales [B. acutorostrata], and humpback whales [Megaptera novaeangliae]) were seen only late in the survey. Abundance is estimated for 19 cetacean species. The overall density of cetaceans is low in the study area, especially for delphinids. The precision of density and abundance estimates is generally low for all species because of the low number of sightings. © 2006 the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Abundance; Cetacean; Density; Dolphin; Hawai'i; Lagenodelphis hosei; Line-transect survey; Multiple covariates; Pacific; Whale","abundance; cetacean; population density; seasonal variation; Hawaiian Islands; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; dolphin (cetacean); Globicephala macrorhynchus; Kogia; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenodelphis hosei; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella coeruleoalba; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Ziphiidae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

Sixteen species were represented in this count, including: minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (1 single stranding), sei whale, B. borealis (1 single stranding), blue whale, B. musculus (1 single stranding), humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (2 single strandings), giant sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (18 single strandings, 2 pair strandings), pygmy sperm whale, Kogia breviceps (5 single strandings), dwarf sperm whale, K. sima (2 single strandings, 1 triple stranding), Blainville's beaked whale, Mesoplodon densirostris (2 single strandings), short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus (4 strandings, 56 individuals), melon-headed whale, Peponocephala electra (1 single stranding and 2 mass strandings totalling 231 individuals), common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (1 single stranding), spinner dolphin, Stenella longirostris (1 pair stranding and 2 mass strandings of groups of ∼30 individuals each), Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus (2 single strandings), dugong, Dugong dugon (14 single strandings), and New Zealand fur seal, Arctocephalus forsteri (3 single strandings). A stranded rorqual identified as an Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), with coloration patterns that did not match known descriptions, was also reported. Sei whale was recorded for the first time in the tropical Southwest Pacific region and Antarctic minke whale, melon-headed whale, and Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin were recorded for the first time in New Caledonia. Strandings of sperm whales were most frequent in the spring, but also occurred in autumn months, suggesting a seasonal pattern of occurrence possibly related to seasonal migration. One stranded humpback whale bore the scars of a killer whale's attack and one dugong was injured by a shark. Scars left by propellers were noted on several stranded animals including one Antarctic minke whale, one pygmy sperm whale, one dwarf sperm whale, and four dugongs. Collisions with vessels were suspected to be a frequent cause of death for dugong. To cite this article: P. Borsa, C. R.

Indeed, the mechanisms of the association between barnacles and whales have not been studied. Here we describe the larval development and settlement of the whale barnacle, Coronula diadema, and possible involvement of a cue from the host in inducing larval settlement. Eight-cell stage embryos were collected from C. diadema on a stranded humpback whale, incubated in filtered seawater for 7 days, and nauplius larvae hatched out. When fed with Chaetoceros gracilis, the nauplii developed to stage VI, and finally metamorphosed to the cypris stage. The larval development looked similar to that of intertidal barnacles with planktotrophic larval stages. The cyprids did not settle in normal seawater, but did settle in polystyrene Petri dishes when incubated in seawater with a small piece of skin tissue from the host whale. This strongly suggests the involvement of a chemical cue from the host whale tissue to induce larval settlement. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Cypris larva; Epizoic barnacle; Larval development; Larval settlement; Settlement cue; Whale barnacle","polystyrene; sea water; crustacean; environmental cue; larval development; settling behavior; article; barnacle; chemical cue; filtration; intertidal zone; larval development; metamorphosis; nonhuman; priority journal; skin culture; whale; Cetacea; Chaetoceros gracilis; Coronula diadema; Cyprididae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Thoracica",,"polystyrene, 9003-53-6",,,,,"Anderson, D.T., Epizootic adaptations (1994) Barnacles: Structure, Function, Development and Evolution, pp. 292-306. , London: Chapman & Hall; Clare, A.S., Matsumura, K., Nature and perception of barnacle settlement pheromones (2000) Biofouling, 15, pp. 57-71; Darwin, C., (1854) A Monograph on the Subclass Cirripedia.

The song is an ordered sequence of individual sound elements separated by gaps of silence. Song samples were converted into sequences of discrete symbols by both human and automated classifiers. This paper analyzes the song structure in these symbol sequences using information entropy estimators and autocorrelation estimators. Both parametric and nonparametric entropy estimators are applied to the symbol sequences representing the songs. The results provide quantitative evidence consistent with the hierarchical structure proposed for these songs by Payne and McVay [Science 173, 587-597 (1971)]. Specifically, this analysis demonstrates that: (1) There is a strong structural constraint, or syntax, in the generation of the songs, and (2) the structural constraints exhibit periodicities with periods of 6-8 and 180-400 units. This implies that no empirical Markov model is capable of representing the songs' structure. The results are robust to the choice of either human or automated song-to-symbol classifiers. In addition, the entropy estimates indicate that the maximum amount of information that could be communicated by the sequence of sounds made is less than 1 bit per second. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Information entropy; Megaptera novaeangliae; Songs; Acoustic waves; Entropy; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Underwater acoustics; article; automation; correlation analysis; entropy; mathematical analysis; priority journal; probability; quantitative analysis; sound transmission; theoretical model; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Entropy; Humpback Whale; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,"10093

Animals are capable of manipulating flow around the body and appendages both passively and actively. Passive mechanisms rely on structural and morphological components of the body (i.e., humpback whale tubercles, riblets). Active flow control mechanisms use appendage or body musculature to directly generate wake flow structures or stiffen fins against external hydrodynamic loads. Fish can actively control fin curvature, displacement, and area. The vortex wake shed by the tail differs between eel-like fishes and fishes with a discrete narrowing of the body in firont of the tail, and three-dimensional effects may play a major role in determining wake structure in most fishes.

Stranding data reveal the presence of two new species (Ziphius cavirostris and Hyperoodon planifrons) in addition to the nine previously identified (Eubalaena glacialis, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus, Mesoplodon layardii, Lagenorhynchus cruciger, Cephalorhynchus commersonii, Orcinus orca, and Globicephala melas). The occasional occurrence of Phocoena dioptrica is confirmed. Since 1989, the most important result is the large number of sightings (n=1649) of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) beyond the Kerguelen Island plateau, in an area rarely visited by fishing boats in the past. For the most common species, Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), distributional data are supplemented by biological and ecological informations. For three species (Physeter macrocephalus, Orcinus orca and Globicephala melas) we provide evidence of interactions with the longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.","Cetaceans; Fishery interactions; Kerguelen Islands; Southern Ocean","dolphin; fishery; geographical distribution; island; new record; new species; taxonomy; whale; French Southern Territories; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Kerguelen Islands; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cephalorhynchus commersonii; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Dissostichus eleginoides; Eubalaena glacialis; Globicephala melas; Hyperoodon planifrons; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon layardii; Orcinus orca; Phocoena dioptrica; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Angot, M., Observations sur les mammifères marins de l'archipel des Kerguelen (1954) Mammalia, 18, pp. 1-111; Ashford, J.R., Rubilar, P.S., Martin, A.R., Interactions between cetaceans and longline fishing operations around South Georgia (1996) Mar.

Levenshtein distance analysis has previously been applied to humpback whale songs, where it provided a quantitative measure of song change from year to year. This analysis is extended and a first approach to a robust statistical test is developed. The statistical test addresses the central issue whether two groups of songs (either from different individuals, different groups or different years) belong to the same population of songs or are significantly different. This is accomplished through derivation of the Kohonen median song sequence, which has the smallest possible summed Levenshtein distance to all songs of the group. By a simple t-test or nonparametric equivalent it is tested whether the median distance to the Kohonen median song sequence of a second group is significantly larger, which indicates that the groups are different. The test is expanded to handle multiple comparisons among several groups of songs. © Brill Academic Publishers 2006.","Birdsong; Humpback whales; Levenshtein distance; Megaptera novaeangliae; Song; String edit distance","Animalia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,"Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, DNRF","We are most grateful to His Majesty King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV, Kingdom of Tonga, for his permission to the South Pacific Humpback Whale Consortium (www.sbs.auckland.ac.nz/ research/ecolevol/baker/baker.htm) to record songs of his humpback whales.

Southeastern Pacific humpback whales migrate between the reproductive area located principally off Ecuador and Colombia and the feeding area located around the Antarctic Peninsula. Previous studies suggested a second feeding area for this population in the Magellan Strait. This study evaluates the site fidelity of humpback whales to the Magellan Strait feeding area using photo-identification data obtained during 10 sighting cruises carried out in three austral summer seasons (2002-2003 to 2004-2005). If the Magellan Strait is a second feeding area for some whales of this population, a high return rate of the same animals photo-identified to this area than by chance would be expected. The site fidelity of humpback whales in different austral summer seasons shown a high return rate (X̄=78.9%). Furthermore no significant differences were found in the return rate between female and males or between different class/age categories. Finally, the high return rate humpback whale, indicate that Magellan Strait is another feeding ground at least for a part of the Southeastern Pacific humpback whales population.","Cetacea; Chile; Photo-identification; Southeast Pacific","feeding ground; site fidelity; whale; Chile; Magellan Strait; South America; Animalia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Östman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-340; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.W., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urbán, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, world-wide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Brown, M.R., Corkeron, P.J., Hale, P.T., Schultz, K.W., Bryden, M.M., Evidence for a sex-segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proceeding of the Royal Society of London, Serie B, Biological Science, 259, pp. 229-234; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Evenson, J.R., Flynn, K.R., Balcomb, K.C., Claridge, D.E., Bloedel, P., Green, G.A., Interchange and isolation of humpback whales off California and other North Pacific feeding grounds (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 215-226; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Rasmussen, K., Urbán, J., Balcomb, K.C., Ladrón de Guevara, P., Salinas, M., Darling, J.D., Migratory destinations of humpback whales that feed off California, Oregon and Washington (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 192, pp. 295-304; Calambokidis, J., Steiger, G.H., Straley, J.M., Herman, L.M., Cerchio, S., Salden, D.R., Urbán, J., Quinn II, T.J., Movements and population structure of humpback whales in the North Pacific (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 769-794; Chaloupka, M., Osmond, M.B., Spatial and seasonal distribution of humpback whales in the Great Barrier Reef Region (1999) Life in the Slow Lane: Ecology and Conservation of Long-Lived Marine Animals, pp. 89-106. , En: Musick JA (ed).

To examine the potential effect of predation by humpback whales, consumption (kg of prey daily) and prey removal (kg of prey annually) were modeled for a current and historic feeding aggregation of humpback whales off northeastern Kodiak Island, Alaska. A current prey biomass removal rate was modeled by using an estimate of the 2002 humpback whale abundance. A historic rate of removal was modeled from a prewhaling abundance estimate (population size prior to 1926). Two provisional humpback whale diets were simulated in order to model consumption rate. One diet was based on the stomach contents of whales that were commercially harvested from Port Hobron whaling station in Kodiak, Alaska, between 1926 and 1937, and the second diet, based on local prey availability as determined by fish surveys conducted within the study area, was used to model consumption rate by the historic population. The latter diet was also used to model consumption by the current population and to project a consumption rate if the current population were to grow to reach the historic population size. Models of these simulated diets showed that the current population likely removes nearly 8.83 × 106 kg of prey during a 5-month humpback whale feeding season, which could include around 3.26 × 106 kg of juvenile pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), 2.55 × 106 kg of capelin (Mallotus villosus), if these species are consumed in proportion to their availability. The historic humpback whale population may have removed over 1.76 × 107 kg of prey annually.",,"abundance; fish; predation; whale; Alaska; Kodiak Island; North America; United States; Cetacea; Mallotus villosus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Pollachius virens; Theragra chalcogramma",,,,,,,"Anderson, P.J., Piatt, J.F., Community reorganization in the Gulf of Alaska following ocean climate regime shift (1999) Mar.

A similar occurrence is recorded in New Zealand and in Vanuatu, where late Pliocene-Pleistocene fossil coronulids have been found in sediments along the coasts that are current humpback whale migration routes. In both Ecuador and New Zealand we have collected fragmentary whale remains in association with these barnacle assemblages. Considering that detachment of whale barnacles from extant humpback whales has only been observed in breeding areas or along migratory routes, we view the Ecuador and New Zealand fossil barnacle assemblages as indirect evidence of whale migration during the late Neogene. Application of this hypothesis to the distribution pattern of fossil Coronula in the Mediterranean Basin, indicates that, unlike the present, mysticete whales may have used the Mediterranean as a breeding ground during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Barnacle;

Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.","Atlantic White-sided Dolphin; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Fin Whale; Harbour Porpoise; Humpback Whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; Minke Whale; Phocoena phocoena; White-beaked Dolphin","abundance; dolphin; porpoise; prey availability; research vessel; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; whale; Canada; Halifax; North America; Nova Scotia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Edited by W.

Here we present 21 records of killer whales from within the Hawaiian Exclusive Economic Zone between 1994 and 2004. Killer whales were recorded nine months of the year, most around the main Hawaiian Islands. Although there were more records than expected during the period when humpback whales are abundant around the Islands, there is likely an increase in sighting effort during that period. Killer whales were documented feeding on both a humpback whale and cephalopods, and two species of small cetaceans were observed fleeing from killer whales. Although it is possible that there are both marine mammal-eating and cephalopod-eating populations within Hawaiian waters, it seems more likely that Hawaiian killer whales may not exhibit foraging specializations as documented for coastal temperate populations. Saddle patch pigmentation patterns were generally fainter and narrower than those seen in killer whales from the temperate coastal North Pacific. Analysis of skin samples from two animals indicated two mitochondrial haplotypes, one identical to the ""Gulf of Alaska transient 2"" haplotype (a mammal-eating form), and the other a new haplotype one base different from haplotypes found for mammal-eating killer whales in coastal Alaskan waters. © 2006 by University of Hawai'i Press.

However, inter-oceanic exchange is rare and difficult to document. Using skin biopsy samples collected in the Indian Ocean and in the South Atlantic Ocean, and a genetic capture-recapture approach based on microsatellite genotyping, we were able to reveal the first direct genetic evidence of the inter-oceanic migration of a male humpback whale. This exceptional migration to wintering grounds of two different ocean basins questions traditional notions of fidelity to an ocean basin, and demonstrates how the behaviour of highly mobile species may be elucidated from combining genetics with long-term field studies. Our finding has implications for management of humpback whale populations, as well as for hypotheses concerning cultural transmission of behaviour. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Humpback whales; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Philopatry","genetic analysis; mark-recapture method; migration; ocean basin; philopatry; whale; animal behavior; animal tissue; arctic climate; article; behavior genetics; controlled study; genotype; microsatellite marker; nonhuman; population migration; priority journal; seasonal variation; skin biopsy; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Indian Ocean; Animalia; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Ayres, K.L., Overall, D.J., API-CALC 1.0: A computer program for calculating the average probability of identity allowing for substructure, inbreeding and the presence of close relatives (2004) Mol.

Accordingly, humpback whales are thought to be polygynous with differences in reproduction among males related to alternative mating tactics. However, there is currently a lack of data on male reproductive success. We tested predictions regarding male reproductive success in humpback whales using molecular assessment of paternity in a population in the Mexican Pacific. Parentage analysis was conducted for 125 mother-calf pairs and a sample of 297 males using 13 microsatellite loci. Two separate analyses were conducted, based upon conservative and relaxed criteria for the assignment of paternity. In the conservative analysis, 40 paternities (32.5% of tested calves) were assigned among 33 males, whereas in the relaxed analysis, 62 paternities (49.6% of calves) were assigned among 51 males. Regardless of analysis, the distribution of male reproductive success deviated from a random mating model, with significantly larger than expected variance (conservative, P = 0.011; relaxed, P = 0.022), and significantly more than expected males siring three calves (conservative, P = 0.021; relaxed, P = 0.011). However, most successful males sired only one calf and no male was assigned more than three calves, so reproductive skew was not severe. Therefore we conclude that this population has a polygynous mating system, but without the large variation in male reproductive success expected by apparent skew in the operational sex ratio and degree of male competition for mates. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Sightings and beach-washed carcasses were widely distributed, from Head of Bight to the Victorian border, with apparent concentrations in eastern Gulf St Vincent, Kangaroo Island and Victor Harbor regions, and to a lesser extent in the south-east of the State and southern Eyre Peninsula. Most sightings involved single whales or groups of two (range 1-4). All five carcasses were neonates or juveniles with total lengths of 3.88 m to approx. 10 m. Estimated lengths (5-15 m) were available for 17 live whales. The geological age of one museum specimen is uncertain but may predate European settlement. This and whaling records from Fowler Bay during 1840 indicate that humpback whales have been present, and may not have been uncommon, in South Australia since at least the early 19th century. Research is needed to determine the relationship of South Australian humpback whales to populations migrating off the western and eastern coasts of Australia.","Distribution; Humpback whale; Sightings; South Australia; Strandings","Cetacea; Macropus sp.; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Victoria",,,,,,,"Aitken, P.F., Whales from the coast of South Australia (1971) Trans.

We defined association patterns based on associate age and sex class, and the mother's reproductive history. Mother/calf pairs had an overall preference for adult males. In years when the same females were not accompanied by a calf, they had a preference for adults of either sex and male sub-adults (whales between five and seven years of age). We also compared associations of females combined for all years that they had calves versus years without a dependent calf and found distinct differences. In years with and without a calf, females often associated with adult males. However, in years with a calf, there was an increase in association with juvenile males and in calf-less years, there was an increase in associations with adult females. The reproductive history of the mother did not seem to impact her associations; analysis of association patterns of mothers with varying reproductive parameters did not yield significant results. Mothers were positioned between the calf and associates in the group significantly more often than expected, both in duration and surfacing frequency. However, the relative positions of individuals in the group were not fixed; they were fluid and shifted often. Interactions between mother and juvenile associates sometimes appeared antagonistic, with the juvenile attempting to place itself next to the calf and the mother blocking its approach. Our data demonstrate that mother/calf pairs, while less social than other humpback whales, have specific social patterns when on their feeding grounds. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2005.","Association; Calf; Humpback; Mother; Social; Whale","Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Altmann, M., Naturalistic studies of maternal care in moose and elk (1963) Maternal Behavior in Mammals, pp. 233-253. , (Rheingold, H.L., ed.).

Humpbacks progressively modify their songs over time in ways that suggest that individuals are copying song elements that they hear being used by other singers. Little is known about the factors that determine how whales learn from their auditory experiences. Song learning in birds is better understood and appears to be constrained by stable core attributes such as species-specific sound repertoires and song syntax. To clarify whether similar constraints exist for song learning by humpbacks, we analyzed changes over 14 years in the sounds used by humpback whales singing in Hawaiian waters. We found that although the properties of individual sounds within songs are quite variable over time, the overall distribution of certain acoustic features within the repertoire appears to be stable. In particular, our findings suggest that species-specific constraints on temporal features of song sounds determine song form, whereas spectral variability allows whales to flexibly adapt song elements. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Acoustic; Baleen whale; Mysticete; Song learning; Sounds","acoustics; animal; article; imitation; learning; male; psychological aspect; sound detection; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animals; Imitative Behavior; Learning; Male; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal; Whales; Aves; Cetacea; Hawaiia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,"Acknowledgements We are most grateful to the many researchers and volunteers at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory who took part in obtaining the recordings analyzed in this study.

These data represent the only information available for this area over a 15-year period. Two-hundred thirty-six whales were sighted during the three years. Relative abundances (sightings/trip) were similar during 1995 and 1997, while in 1996 abundance was greater with a distinct peak during the beginning of March. For mothers with calves, sightings were most frequent within the 0-50 m and 50-100 m depth ranges, while other humpbacks were distributed throughout all depth ranges. Compared to other whales, the proportion of mothers with calf was higher in the shallowest depth range (0-50 m) for the three years. Trends in abundance and depth distributions are consistent with previous investigations, both in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Our study extends the spatial distribution of the humpback whales off northwestern Puerto Rico showing the importance of other offshore areas away from the insular platform.

Variation in local coastal upwelling, coupled with larger scale processes (El Niño/La Niña) affects the productivity and distribution of marine species at all trophic levels. Herein, we present an analysis of the occurrence patterns of marine mammals in the central CCS and relate these patterns to changing ocean climate and prey availability. Data on marine mammal distributions, ocean conditions, and prey availability were collected in waters overlying the continental shelf and slope from Bodega to Monterey Bays, from 1986 to 1994 and 1997 to 1999. Occurrence patterns were investigated using geographical information system (GIS), percent similarity index (PSI), multiple logistic regression, and principal component analyses. Spatial patterns of the most frequently sighted species (California sea lion Zalophus californianus, northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus, Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhyncus obliquidens, Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli, harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena, and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae) were related to bathymetry and changing ocean climate, and were likely to have been mediated by changes in prey availability. Temporal changes were related to migration and significant differences in ocean structure resulting from both local and large-scale processes. © Inter-Research 2005.","Bathymetry; California Current System; Cetaceans; Coastal upwelling; El Niño; La Niña; Marine mammals; Ocean habitats; Pinnipeds","biological oceanography; current; El Nino; geographical distribution; La Nina; marine mammal; species occurrence; upwelling; California Current; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; World; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Lagenorhyncus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Otariidae; Panthera leo; Phocidae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Pinnipedia; Zalophus californianus",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Boekelheid, R.J., An ecological comparison of oceanic seabird communities of the South Pacific Ocean (1983) Stud Avian Biol, 8, pp. 2-23; Allen, S.G., (1994) The Distribution and Abundance of Marine Birds and Mammals in the Gulf of the Farallones and Adjacent Waters, 1985-1992, , PhD dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, CA; Antonelis Jr., G.A., Perez, M.A., Estimated annual food consumption by northern fur seals in the California Current (1984) Calif Coop Ocean Fish Investig Rep, 26, pp. 135-145; Aseltine-Neilson, D., Bergen, D., Erickson, M., Haaker, P., Review of some California fisheries for 1999: Market squid, Dungeness crab, sea urchin, prawn, abalone, groundfish, swordfish and shark, ocean salmon, nearshore finfish, Pacific sardine, Pacific herring, Pacific mackerel, reduction, white seabass, and recreational (2000) Calif Coop Ocean Fish Investig Rep, 41, pp. 8-29; Baltz, K.A., (1997) Ten Years of Hydrographic Variability off Central California during the Upwelling Season, , MS thesis Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA; Barlow, J., Harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, abundance estimation for California, Oregon, and Washington: Part I: Ship surveys (1988) Fish Bull US Dep Comm, 86, pp. 417-431; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

The Tongan humpbacks are considered part of Southern Hemisphere Group V that splits during migration, some swimming to Eastern Australia and others to various Polynesian Islands. During this time long complex songs are produced. The song is thought to be a male breeding display and may serve either as an intra-sexual or an inter-sexual signal or both. It is in a constant state of change that occurs every season. Since these changes are directional they cannot be described by drift, and singers incorporate changes as they occur, thus song must be shared through cultural transmission. This investigation describes the cultural changes that occurred in 158 songs recorded from Tongan humpbacks through the 1990s. The rate of change differed within years, some themes were retained for as much as five years and others were lost after only two years. The farther apart the years the less similar are the songs, as in the humpback songs of the Northern Hemisphere. The largest number of changes seems to have occurred in the early 1990s where all themes seemed to have been lost and new ones originated. What initiates these changes remains speculative, but we assess some hypotheses in relation to humpback whale behaviour and cultural transmission in avian song. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2005.","Cultural transmission; Humpback whales; Song change","Aves; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) through Hawaiian waters (1984) Can.

Based on data recorded from the EEZ by the Southwest Fisheries Service Center, Cascadia Research Collective, and CIMAR between 1979-2001, we mapped the distribution of 18 cetacean species. Our results suggest that the majority of the cetacean species use primarily oceanic waters, particularly those species within the families Balaenopteridae, Kogiidae, Physeteridae and Ziphiidae. Members of the family Delphinidae showed a wide variety of distribution patterns: seven species are widespread throughout the EEZ, four appear to be exclusively pelagic, and two are primarily coastal. Overall, three cetacean species appear to have populations concentrated in coastal waters: Stenella attenuata graffmani, Tursiops truncatus, and Megaptera novaeangliae. These three may be more susceptible to human activities due to the overlap of their ranges with fishery areas (tuna and artisanal fisheries), and an uncontrolled increase of touristic whale watching activities in several parts of their range. The distribution maps represent the first comprehensive representation of cetacean species that inhabit Costa Rican Pacific waters. They provide essential base-line information that may be used to initiate conservation and management efforts of the habitats where these animals reproduce and forage.","Central America; Conservation; Dolphins; Marine mammals; Whales","animal; article; classification; Costa Rica; dolphin; ecosystem; environmental protection; food industry; Pacific Ocean; population density; population dynamics; season; statistics; whale; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Costa Rica; Dolphins; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Whales; Animalia; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinidae; dolphin (whale); Kogiidae; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeteridae; Scombridae gen. sp.; Stenella attenuata graffmani; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Wursig, B., Preliminary observations on bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, at Isla del Coco, Costa Rica (1991) Aquatic Mamm., 17, pp. 148-151; Acevedo-Gutierrez, A., Smultea, M.A., First records of humpback whales including calves at Golfo Dulce and Isla del Coco, Costa Rica, suggesting geographical overlap of northern and southern Hemisphere populations (1995) Mar.

Entanglements in the western North Atlantic are a major source of injury and mortality for endangered large whales. In this study, entanglements of 31 right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 30 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were analyzed to determine the types and parts of gear involved. When gear was identified, 89% (n = 32) of the entanglements were attributed to pot and gill net gear; however, a wide range of specific gear types were implicated. Despite gear recovery, gear type was not identified in 20% (n = 9) of the cases. Although pot gear was recovered from both species equally, gill net gear was less frequently retrieved from right whales (n = 2) than humpback whales (n = 11). When gear part was identified, 81% (n = 21) involved entanglements in buoy line and/or groundline. For right whales, the most common point of gear attachment was the mouth (77.4%); for humpback whales, the tail (53%) and the mouth (43%) were common attachment sites. Four right and three humpback whales in this sample were known to have died subsequent to entanglement. However, when identified, the gear types and parts involved in lethal cases were not substantially different from entanglements with non-lethal outcomes. Large whales can become entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear types and parts, and additional insight will depend on continued efforts to document entanglements and recover associated gear. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Bycatch; Entanglement; Entanglement risk; Eubalaena glacialis; Fisheries; Gear type; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mortality; North Atlantic right whale","bycatch; fishing gear; fishing mortality; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback whales (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 535-546; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., Wetmore, S.E., Smith, T.D., Mead, J.G., Length at birth and at independence in humpback whales (1999) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 1, pp. 141-146; Clapham, P.J., Barlow, J., Bessinger, M., Cole, T., Mattila, D., Pace, R., Palka, D., Seton, R., Abundance and demographic parameters of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine, and stock definition relative to the Scotian Shelf (2003) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 5, pp. 13-22; Report of the Workshop on the Comprehensive Assessment of Right Whales Worldwide (1999) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 1 (SUPPL.), pp. 119-120; Report of the Workshop on Status and Trends of Western North Atlantic Right Whales (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 61-87; Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Mortality and serious injury of northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the western North Atlantic Ocean (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 193-208; Pettis, H.M., Rolland, R.M., Hamilton, P.K., Brault, S., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Visual health assessment of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) using photographs (2004) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 82, pp. 8-19; Read, A.J., Wade, P.R., Status of marine mammals in the United States (2000) Conservation Biology, 14, pp. 929-940; Reeves, R.R., Smith, B.D., Crespo, E., Notarbartolo Di Sciara, G., (2003) Dolphins, Whales, and Porpoises: 2003-2010 Conservation Action Plan for the World's Cetaceans, 147p. , Species Survival Commission, IUCN, Gland, Switzerland; Waring, G.T., Pace, R.M., Quintal, J.M., Fairfield, C.P., Maze-Foley, K., U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico marine mammal stock assessments - 2003 (2003) NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-182, 287p. , U.S. Department of Commerce","Johnson, A.; National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Region, Protected Resources Division, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930, United States; email: amanda.johnson@noaa.gov",,,"Society for Marine Mammology",,,,,08240469,,MMSCE,,"English","Mari.

Distributions of four large whale species: fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), minke (B. acutorostrata) and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) aligned with proposed metapopulation breaks in diet and population trend of SSLs. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) were widely distributed throughout the study area, and killer whales were particularly prevalent along the north Aleutian Island coastlines between Unimak Pass and Samalga Pass. Biopsies determined that most killer whales (92%) were of the piscivorous (resident) ecotype as opposed to the mammal-eating (transient) ecotype observed in 2002 only. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore relationships between these multispecies patterns in distribution, oceanographic variables (salinity, temperature, fluorescence and depth) and proximity to six Aleutian passes. The GAMs indicated the best-fit models and most significant correlations as determined by the Akaike function and Cp-statistics were: depth and proximity to the nearest measured pass for SSLs and all cetaceans, respectively; frequencies of herring and salmon in SSL diet with population trend; fluorescence in the top 50 m with occurrence of humpback, minke, and killer whales; and surface temperature with occurrence of humpback, killer, and sperm whales. Results of the GAM analyses suggest foci for future investigation of relationships between physical variables and interspecific patterns of marine mammal distribution. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biophysical; Cetacean; Generalized additive models; Killer whales; Metapopulation; Orca; Steller sea lion","diet; pinniped; population distribution; population dynamics; diet; ecotype; interspecific interaction; metapopulation; pinniped; piscivore; population decline; survey; whale; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; North America; United States; Alaska; Alaska Peninsula; Aleutian Islands; North America; United States; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Delphinidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Delphinidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Is It Food?

Harvey and Associates, San Jose, CA 95118, United States","Associations between cetacean distributions, oceanographic features, and bioacoustic backscatter were examined during two process cruises in the northern California Current System (CCS) during late spring and summer 2000. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans were conducted across the shelf and slope, out to 150 km offshore from Newport, Oregon (44.6°N) to Crescent City, California (41.9°N), in conjunction with multidisciplinary mesoscale and fine-scale surveys of ocean and ecosystem structure. Occurrence patterns (presence/absence) of cetaceans were compared with hydrographic and ecological variables (e.g., sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, halocline depth, chlorophyll maximum, distance to the center of the equatorward jet, distance to the shoreward edge of the upwelling front, and acoustic backscatter at 38, 120, 200 and 420 kHz) derived from a towed, undulating array and a bioacoustic system. Using a multiple logistic regression model, 60.2% and 94.4% of the variation in occurrence patterns of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae during late spring and summer, respectively, were explained. Sea surface temperature, depth, and distance to the alongshore upwelling front were the most important environmental variables during June, when humpbacks occurred over the slope (200-2000 m). During August, when humpbacks concentrated over a submarine bank (Heceta Bank) and off Cape Blanco, sea surface salinity was the most important variable, followed by latitude and depth. Humpbacks did not occur in the lowest salinity water of the Columbia River plume. For harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena, the model explained 79.2% and 70.1% of the variation in their occurrence patterns during June and August, respectively. During spring, latitude, sea surface salinity, and thermocline gradient were the most important predictors. During summer, latitude and distance to the inshore edge of the upwelling front were the most important variables. Typically a coastal species, harbor porpoises extended their distribution farther offshore at Heceta Bank and at Cape Blanco, where they were associated with the higher chlorophyll concentrations in these regions. Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens was the most numerous small cetacean in early June, but was rare during August. The model explained 44.5% of the variation in their occurrence pattern, which was best described by distance to the upwelling front and acoustic backscatter at 38 kHz. The model of the occurrence pattern of Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli was more successful when mesoscale variability in the CCS was higher during summer. Thus, the responses of cetaceans to biophysical features and upwelling processes in the northern CCS were both seasonally and spatially specific. Heceta Bank and associated flow-topography interactions were very important to a cascade of trophic dynamics that ultimately influenced the distribution of foraging cetaceans. The higher productivity associated with upwelling near Cape Blanco also had a strong influence on the distribution of cetaceans. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In Australia, with whale-watchers approaching one million per annum there has been considerable effort to develop management regimes that protect the whales while enabling the development of a sustainable ecotourism industry. A mixture of National and State laws and regulations have governed the industry (Tourism based on free-ranging marine wildlife: opportunities and responsibilities, Wildlife Tourism Research Report No. 11, Status Assessment of Wildlife Tourism in Australia Series, CRC for Sustainable Tourism, Gold Coast, Queensland) but these have been mainly derived from experiences with humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whale watching from vessels at sea. In this article we describe the development and nature of new and rapidly growing swim-with-whales operations based on the dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Great Barrier Reef of northern Queensland. The distinctly different quality of these operations raise interesting questions for long-term management (Towards sustainable management of the developing dwarf minke whale tourism industry in northern Queensland, CRC Reef Research Technical Report 27, James Cook University of North Queensland, 30pp (emended version of SC/50/WW1)). In the 1999-2000 seasons, 453 passengers (88.1% of respondents) swam with minke whales. Only 25% of visitors came specifically for the whale interactions and 43% learned of the whales on board the vessel. Passengers thus had low expectations about whales and encounters. A variety of factors, including the diving experience, particular dive sites, a range of wildlife species and socializing contributed to visitor satisfaction. Nonetheless, there was a significant correlation between visitor satisfaction and closeness of approaches by the whales, total number of whales seen and total time spent with whales. We discuss the key issues associated with swim-with-whales programs in the light of our findings. The cooperative engagement of tourism operators, researchers and government management agencies is a feature of this new industry. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on 10,567 photographs of 2,400 individual whales taken from 1979 to 1996. The central North Pacific stock winters in Hawai'i and migrates to discrete feeding areas in Alaska for the summer and autumn. The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) estimate of annual survival based on annual sightings in Hawai'i was 0.963 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.944-0.978) and the Pradel estimate was 0.963 (95% CI: 0.944-0.976), with a population rate of increase of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03-1.16). The best survival estimate for southeastern Alaska whales, based on Barker's model, was 0.957 (95% CI: 0.943-0.967). The best survival estimate for Prince William Sound whales, also based on Barker's model, was 0.984 (95% CI: 0.954-0.995). Whales from the central North Pacific stock mix in Hawai'i; therefore, the best apparent survival estimate for the entire stock is from the pooled Hawai'i data. However, this analysis also demonstrated that we could reduce heterogeneity with Barker's model and obtain more plausible estimates of survival for the whales in discrete feeding areas using semiannual sightings in Hawai'i as opportunistic resightings. © 2004 American Society of Mammalogists.","Adult survival; Capture-recapture; Demography; Humpback whale; Marine mammal; Megaptera novaeangliae; North Pacific; Photo identification; Program MARK","photography; population estimation; survival; whale; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); World; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Proceeding of the 2nd International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , (B.

Additionally, small boat surveys were conducted in the same region between 1989 and 2002 to gather photographic identification data on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) to examine movements and population structure. In the six years of ship survey effort, 706 sightings of 15 marine mammal species were made. Humpback whales were the most common large cetacean species and were seen every year and a total of 232 sightings of 402 animals were recorded during ship surveys. Highest numbers were observed in 2002, when there were 79 sightings of 139 whales. Line-transect estimates for humpback whales indicated that about 100 humpback whales inhabited these waters each year between 1995 and 2000; in 2002, however, the estimate was 562 (CV=0.21) whales. A total of 191 unique individuals were identified photographically and mark-recapture estimates also indicated that the number of animals increased from under 100 to over 200 from 1995 to 2002. There was only limited interchange of humpback whales between this area and feeding areas off Oregon and California. Killer whales were also seen on every ship survey and represented all known ecotypes of the Pacific Northwest, including southern and northern residents, transients, and offshore-type killer whales. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were the most frequently sighted small cetacean; abundance was estimated at 181-291 individuals, except for 2002 when we observed dramatically higher numbers (876, CV=0.30). Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) were the most common pinnipeds observed. There were clear habitat differences related to distance offshore and water depth for different species.",,"geographical distribution; marine mammal; movement; population size; population structure; whale; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); World; Animalia; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; elephant; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mirounga; Mirounga angustirostris; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocidae; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Herman, L.M., Population characteristics of individually identified humpback whales in southeastern Alaska: Summer and fall 1986 (1992) Fish.

Concentrations of DDTs have declined by an order of magnitude over the last three decades in California sea lions; nevertheless, the measured concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in California sea lions are still some of the highest values reported for marine mammals in recent years. Concentrations of organochlorines were highly correlated with one another. Concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in the blubber of gray whale, humpback whale, northern elephant seal, and harbor seal, and in the adipose fat of sea otter, were lower than the levels found in California sea lions, and were in the range of a few to several μg/g on a lipid weight basis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphological features of the skull are summarized as follows: the supraorbital process of the frontal is elongated laterally and its posterior margin is straight; the orbit is relatively short considering the skull size; the squamosal is slender and protrudes anterolaterally at an obtuse angle; the squamosal sulcus is not developed at the base of the zygomatic process; the dorsal shape of the supra-occipital is equilaterally triangular; the basioccipital and the basisphenoid are fused, forming a wide plane on the ventral surface; the alisphenoid is not exposed in the temporal region. Based on these characteristics, the specimen was identified as Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski, 1781). This is the first record of M. novaeangliae in the western North Pacific during Pleistocene time. No fossil has yet been described systematically as M. novaeangliae from Pleistocene strata. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that the new material is the oldest M. novaeangliae fossil in the world. © by the Palaentological Society of Japan.","Alisphenoid; Central Japan; Kioroshi Formation; Late Middle Pleistocene; Megaptera novaeangliae; North Pacific; Skull","morphology; Pleistocene; skull; whale; Asia; Chiba; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; World; Cetacea; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, A.N., Pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata (Gray, 1846) (1985) Handbook of Marine Mammals, The Sirenians and Baleen Whales, 3, pp. 345-354. , Ridgway, S.

A total of 1700 km2 of ocean habitat was surveyed over six cruises. We considered the distribution of the most abundant marine birds and mammals in relation to bathymetry. We focused our analyses on eight focal taxa: Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), common murre (Uria aalge), sooty shearwater (Puffinus grieus), phalarope species (red, and red-necked: Phalaropus fulicaria, Phalaropus lobatus), Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). We evaluated associations of top predators with seven bathymetric indices and three distance measurements to shallow-water topographies. The bathymetric descriptors included (1) median depth, (2) depth coefficient of variation, (3) contour index, and shortest distance to (4) the mainland, (5) the continental shelf-break (200-m isobath), (6) the continental slope (1000-m isobath), and (7) pelagic waters (3000-m isobath). The measurements of shallow water topographies included the shortest distance to: (8) the Cordell Bank seamount, (9) the Farallon Island Archipelago (a breeding colony for auklets and murres), and (10) Monterey Canyon. We documented two instances of spatial autocorrelation (for Cassin's auklet and common murre) at lags (distances) of 0-3 and 3-9 km, respectively, and accounted for this spatial pattern in analyses of habitat associations. We found similar relationships between cetaceans and bathymetric features at both interannual and weekly time scales. Seabirds revealed both persistent and variable relationships through time. For the resident breeding murres, we detected an interannual trend in habitat use, with these birds shifting their distribution offshore over time. Our study demonstrates that resident and migrant marine birds and cetaceans are associated with bathymetric features and shallow-water topographies, though responses varied across species and time. In spite of this variability, we contend that bathymetric associations of upper trophic-level predators can help delineate sites of elevated trophic transfer. An understanding of marine productivity and predator aggregation patterns is essential to design ecosystem-level conservation plans for protecting marine habitats and species. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The area studied stretched from the coast out to the offshore margin of the banks, determined approximately by the 200 m depth contours, between c. 61°70′N and c. 66°N. The surveys were conducted between early July and mid-August and 993 h were expended on searching effort. A total of 670 groups of humpback whales was encountered leading to the identification of 348 individual animals. Three areas of concentration were identified: an area off Nuuk; an area at c. 63°30′N; and an area off Frederikshåb. Sequential Petersen capture-recapture estimates of abundance were calculated for five pairs of years at 357 (1988-89), 355 (1989-90), 566 (1990-91), 376 (1991-92), and 348 (1992-93). Excluding the anomalously high estimate in 1990-91, the simple mean is 359 (SE = 27.3, CV = 0.076) and the inverse CV-squared weighted mean is 356 animals (SE = 24.9, CV = 0.070). These calculations lead us to conclude that between 1988 and 1993 there were 360 humpbacks (CV = 0.07) in the West Greenland feeding aggregation. Using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model framework non-calf survival rate was estimated at 0.957 (SE = 0.028). Our data have low power (P < 0.3) to detect a trend of 3.1%, assuming the probability of a type 1 error was 0.05.","Abundance; Distribution; Humpback whales; Mark-recapture; Megaptera novaeangliae; West Greenland","abundance; abundance estimation; mark-recapture method; spatial distribution; whale; Animalia; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , Petrov, B.

To extend research westward in the North Pacific, small-boat surveys were conducted near the Shumagin Islands during the summers of 1999-2002. Photographs of the natural markings of humpback whales were collected, representing 413 sightings of 171 individual whales. Small samples of skin tissue were collected from 20 individuals, including two mother-calf pairs, for sex identification and comparison of mtDNA haplogroups with previously published results from surveys in other regions of the North Pacific. Individual identification photographs were used in mark-recapture analysis to estimate abundance for the Shumagin Island region. The best estimate was given by a modified Jolly-Seber method: N = 410 (95% CI: 241-683) for 2002. Comparison of photographs with archived photographs from throughout the North Pacific revealed four migratory destinations for 13 of the Shumagin Islands whales: Hawai'i, Japan, offshore Mexico, and coastal Mexico. The frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups differed significantly from those in three other sampled feeding grounds: California, southeastern Alaska, and Prince William Sound. The haplogroup frequencies and migratory destinations of individuals suggested an affinity with the Hawaiian wintering ground but data are insufficient to associate whales off the Shumagin Islands with any surveyed breeding ground.",,"Coastal zones; DNA; Photography; Research; Sampling; Skin; Tissue; Coastal waters; Mark-recapture analysis; Migratory destinations; Small-boat surveys; Biodiversity; abundance; abundance estimation; genetic differentiation; whale; Alaska; North America; Shumagin Islands; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Cetacea; Hawaiia; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., DeMaster, D.P., Lopez, A., (2001) Alaska Marine Mammal Stock Assessments, 2001, , NOAA Tech.

Photographs were obtained from 1984 to 1996 at various locations along the east coast of Australia, from northern Queensland to southern New South Wales. Photographs were classified in terms of the level and type of scarring. The possible predator and whether the markings appeared fresh were also noted. In all, 17% of identified east Australian humpbacks possessed some form of predatory scarring, 57% of which was minor and 43% major. Almost all predatory scarring was consistent with that inflicted by killer whales. Only three whales demonstrated an increase in the level of predatory scarring after their first sightings. Two incidents of fresh scarring were recorded, and one fatal killer whale attack on a humpback whale calf was directly observed. The overall level of predatory scarring found in this study is comparable to those found in studies for Northern Hemisphere humpback whales. The low incidence of adult whales showing their first sign of predatory scarring after their initial sighting, and the small number possessing recent scarring, support the idea that east Australian humpback whales experience most predatory attacks early in life.",,"photograph; predation; whale; Australasia; Australia; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Blackmer, A.L., Anderson, S.K., Weinrich, M.T., Temporal variability in features used to photo-identify humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 338-354; Brown, M.R., Butterworth, D.S., Estimating abundance of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (1999) International Whaling Commission Document SC/51CWWS, 35, pp. 1-15; Bryden, M.M., Kirkwood, G.P., Slade, R.W., Humpback whales, Area V.

The analyses included records of 213 individuals (excluding 16 calves used in paternity inference) identified by genotypes (9 loci), and 210 identified by fluke photographs, collected from 1995 to 2001. By comparing records of 175 individuals identified using both genotypes and photographs, a small number of errors were detected (and corrected) in the photo-identification catalogue and in the field and laboratory notes of the genotypes. Using the weighted mean of the Petersen capture-recapture model, the estimate of abundance based on genotyping (N = 533, CV = 0.15) was larger than the estimate based on photo-identification (N = 327, CV = 0.11). Sex-specific estimates of abundance based on genotypes were similar for males and females although the variance of the female estimate was greater than the male (Nf = 248, CV = 0.30; Nm = 288, CV = 0.18, respectively). The paternity of 5 calves from 16 sampled cow/calf pairs was inferred from the total sample of 133 non-calf males (one offspring each). The 16 sampled cow/calf pairs and the 5 inferred paternities were used for an alternate 'gametic recapture' estimate of male abundance. This gametic recapture estimate (Nm = 379, CV = 0.30) was similar to the sex-specific estimate based on the organismal recapture using a 2-sample model (Nm = 382, CV = 0.22). The close agreement of the organismal and gametic recapture estimates support the assumption that this humpback whale wintering ground represents an autonomous population unit that is relatively closed to demographic and reproductive interchange. The current low abundance of the New Caledonian breeding unit highlights the slow recovery of this and some other regional populations in the Southern Hemisphere following intensive 20th century commercial and illegal whaling.","Abundance; Humpback whales; Megaptera novaeangliae; Microsatellite genotyping; Paternity; Photo-identification; Population recovery; Reproductive autonomy","abundance estimation; autonomy; mark-recapture method; whale; Melanesia; New Caledonia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Paralichthys dentatus; transposons; Trematoda; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Amos, B., Schlotterer, C., Tautz, D., Social structure of pilot whales revealed by analytical DNA profiling (1993) Science, 30, pp. 670-672; Anderson, M.J., Hinton, G., Paton, D., Baverstock, P.R., A model for integration of microsatellite genotyping with photographic identification of humpback whales (2001) Mem Queensl Mus, 47, pp. 451-458; Annex G Report of the sub-committee on comprehensive assessment of southern hemisphere humpback whales (1998) Rep Int Whal Comm, 48, pp. 170-182; Report of the scientific committee (2000) J Cetacean Res Manag (Suppl), 2, pp. 1-65; Baker, C.S., Medrano-Gonzalez, L., World-wide distribution and diversity of humpback whale mitochondrial DNA lineages (2002) Cell and Molecular Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 84-99. , Pfeiffer CJ (ed) Krieger Publishing, Melbourne, FL; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Population structure, molecular systematics and forensic identification of whales and dolphins (1995) Conservation Genetics: Case Histories from Nature, pp. 10-49. , Avise J, Hamrick JL (eds) Chapman & Hall, New York; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on the distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Straley, J.M., Perry, A., Population characteristics of individually identified humpback whales in southeastern Alaska: Summer and fall 1986 (1992) Fish Bull, 90, pp. 429-437; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Weinrich, M.T., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and worldwide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 90, pp. 8239-8243; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.W., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, world-wide (1994) Mol Ecol, 3, pp. 313-327; Baker, C.S., Flórez-González, L., Abernethy, B., Rosenbaum, H.C., Slade, R.W., Capella, J., Bannister, J.L., Mitochondrial DNA variation and maternal gene flow among humpback whales of the Southern Hemisphere (1998) Mar Mamm Sci, 14, pp. 721-737; Baker, C.S., Donoghue, M., Constantine, R., Population status and genetic identity of humpback whales on the wintering grounds of Tonga - A slow recovery or colonization?

Although a few songs have been opportunistically recorded on the whales' high-latitude feeding grounds, singing in these regions was thought to be only sporadic. We report results from the first continuous acoustic monitoring of a humpback whale feeding ground (off Cape Cod, MA, USA) in spring. Using autonomous sea-floor recording systems, we found singing on a daily basis over the entire 25 day monitoring period, from 14 May to 7 June 2000. For much of the period, song was recorded 24 h per day. These results, combined with evidence for aseasonal conceptions in whaling catch data, suggest that the humpback whale breeding season should no longer be considered as confined to lower-latitude regions in winter. Rather, we suggest breeding extends geographically and temporally onto feeding grounds into at least spring and early summer. Singing at these times represents either low-cost opportunistic advertising by (perhaps relatively few) males to court females that failed to conceive during the winter, and/or possibly an intrasexual display.","Humpback whale; Mating systems; North atlantic; Song","acoustic method; feeding ground; monitoring; song; vocalization; whale; acoustics; animal behavior; article; breeding; conception; courtship; feeding ecology; latitude; male; nonhuman; priority journal; recording; sexual behavior; singing; social behavior; spring; summer; whale; winter; Animalia; Cetacea; Gadus morhua; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Can.

Therefore, their presence in shelf systems is a good indicator of productive food webs. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans conducted during the late 1990s in the SE Bering Sea (160.32 to 171.08° W) indicate that the middle shelf (50 m &lt; z &lt; 100 m) now supports the highest whale biomass in this region. In recent decades, whales were rare and hence their ecological role on the shelf was limited. During July 1997, the density and abundance (N) of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were highest on the middle shelf between 163.7 and 168.1° W: 0.0236 humpback whales km -2, N = 1308 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.65), and 0.00924 fin whales km-2, N = 513 (CV = 0.61), respectively. Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1° W): 0.0169 fin whales km-2, N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79 % of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170° W (0.77 × 106 mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.","Bering Sea; Carbon; Cetaceans; Coccolithophore; Ecosystem changes; Whales","carbon;

In order to execute these banking and turning maneuvers, humpback whales utilize extremely mobile flippers. The humpback whale flipper is unique because of the presence of large protuberances or tubercles located on the leading edge which gives this surface a scalloped appearance. We show, through wind tunnel measurements, that the addition of leading-edge tubercles to a scale model of an idealized humpback whale flipper delays the stall angle by approximately 40%, while increasing lift and decreasing drag. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,"Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Drag; Ocean habitats; Wind tunnels; Humpback whale; Protuberances; Tubercles; Marine biology; Fish",,,,,,,"Jurasz, C.M., Jurasz, V.P., Feeding modes of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, in southeast Alaska (1979) Sci.

Aural and spectral analyses of digital recordings were completed for approximately 20 song cycles, totaling 5 hours of song from 10 different recording events. We identified 24 note types, organized in five themes. All songs presented the same themes and the order in which they were sung did not vary. We registered the appearance of a note type and the disappearance of a phrase ending, which indicate that the song changed as the season progressed. Moreover, we detected individual variation in the way singers performed certain complex note types. As songs are transmitted culturally, it is likely that singers have different abilities to compose and/or learn new notes. If, as it has been previously suggested, 'new' songs are preferred to 'old' ones, these more able singers will be sending out information about their learning abilities that could be used by other whales to decide whether or not to interact with them.","2000; Brazilian population; Humpback Whale; Individual song variation; Megaptera novaeangliae; Song","Cetacea; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Cato, D.H., Songs of Humpback Whales: The Australian perspective (1991) Mem Queensl Mus, pp. 277-290; Cerchio, S.J., Jacobsen, K., Norms, T.F., Temporal and geographical variation in songs of Humpback Whales, Megaptera novaeangliae: Synchronous change in Hawaiian and Mexican breeding assemblages (2001) Anim Behav, 62, pp. 313-329; Clapham, P.J., The social and reproductive biology of Humpback Whales: An ecological perspective (1996) Mammal Review, 26, pp. 27-49; Darling, J.D., Beruhe, M., Interactions of singing Humpback Whales with other males (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2001) Mar Mammal Sci, 17, pp. 570-584; Dawbin, W.H., Eyre, E.J., Humpback Whale songs along the coast of Western Australia and some comparison with East Coast songs (1991) Mem Queensl Mus, pp. 249-254; Guinee, L.N., Payne, K.B., Rhyme-like repetitions in songs of Humpback Whales (1988) Ethology, 79, pp. 295-306; Mattila, D.K., Guinee, L.N., Mayo, C.A., Humpback Whale songs on a North Atlantic feeding ground (1987) J Mammal, 68, pp. 880-883; Noad, M.J., Cato, D.H., Bryden, M.M., Jenner, M.N., Jenner, C.S., Cultural revolution in whale songs (2000) Nature, 408, p. 537; Payne, K.B., Payne, R.S., Large scale changes over 19 years in songs of Humpback Whales in Bermuda (1985) Z Tierpsychol, 68, pp. 89-114; Payne, K.B., Tyack, P., Payne, R.S., Progressive changes in the songs of Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae): A detailed analysis of two seasons in Hawaii (1983) Communication and Behavior of Whales, pp. 9-57. , PAYNE RS (Ed).

Evidence is presented on the migratory patterns of Antarctic humpback whales based upon movements of individuals identified by natural markings as part of a large-scale international collaboration. Recapture rates were compared between animals from the low latitude breeding and calving areas along the northeastern (n=288) and northwestern (n=325) margins of South America with those identified in the high-latitude feeding areas in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula (n=535). The number of individuals re-sighted in the Antarctic Peninsula differed dramatically between eastern and western South America (c2=40.98, p=1.5 3 10-10). No individuals from Brazil were re-sighted in either the Antarctic Peninsula or off western South America. In contrast, 43 individuals from western South America were identified off the Antarctic Peninsula. These findings suggest that the northwest coast of South America represents an important breeding ground destination for at least some of the humpback whales that feed near the Antarctic Peninsula, but provide no support for movement between the Antarctic Peninsula and the east coast of South America. © 2004 International Whaling Commission.

Over 120 individuals or groups provided photographs that contributed to these analyses. Photographic comparison was conducted with assistance from B. Holm, M. McOsker, P. Olson, J. Rock and O. Uz. Field assistance was provided by P. Acuña, M.I. Barraquer, M. Bassoi, R. Bernal, G. Bravo, D. Danilewicz, P. Falk, P.A. Flores, E. Pérez, L. González, L. Medrano, I. Moreno and M.C.O. Santos. A. Larrea edited the INACH catalogue. Versions of this work have benefited from critical reading by R. Reeves, J. Robbins, P. Hammond, S. Katona, C. Petersen and J. Anderson. The formation of the Antarctic Humpback Whale Catalogue, its growth and expanding collaborative nature owe much to the efforts of C. Carlson, S. Katona and G. Stone. Financial support for conducting the photographic analysis was provided by the Friends of Conservation, the International Whaling Commission, and numerous contributors to the Antarctic Humpback Whale Catalogue programme, with additional logistical and financial support from Allied Whale, College of the Atlantic.

Although humpbacks have been studied intensively in nearshore or coastal feeding and breeding areas, their migratory movements between these areas have been largely inferred. Blue whales have only been studied intensively along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and their seasonal occurrence and movements elsewhere in the North Atlantic are poorly known. We investigated the historical seasonal distributions of these two species using sighting and catch data extracted from American 18th and 19th century whaling logbooks. These data suggest that humpback whales migrated seasonally from low-latitude calving/ breeding grounds over a protracted period, and that some of them traveled far offshore rather than following coastal routes. Also, at least some humpbacks apparently fed early in the summer west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, well south of their known present-day feeding grounds. In assessing the present status of the North Atlantic humpback population, it will be important to determine whether such offshore feeding does in fact occur. Blue whales were present across the southern half of the North Atlantic during the autumn and winter months, and farther north in spring and summer, but we had too few data points to support inferences about these whales' migratory timing and routes.","Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Migration; North Atlantic","feeding ground; migration; population distribution; seasonality; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Musculus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Taylor, S., Sutherland, H., Logbook records of 19th century American sperm whaling: A report on the 12 month project, 1978-79 (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 821-833; Charif, R.A., Clapham, P.J., Clark, C.W., Acoustic detections of singing humpback whales in deep waters off the British Isles (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 751-768; Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Palsbøll, P.J., High latitude area composition of humpback whale competitive groups in Samana Bay - Further evidence for panmixis in the North Atlantic population (1993) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 71, pp. 1065-1066; Clark, C.W., Blue deep voices: Insights from the Navy's Whales '93 program (1994) Whalewatcher, 28 (1), pp. 6-11; Dickinson, A., Sanger, C., Modern shore-based whaling in Newfoundland and Labrador: Expansion and consolidation, 1898-1902 (1990) International Journal of Maritime History, 2, pp. 83-116; Ingebrigtsen, A., Whales caught in the North Atlantic and other seas (1929) Rapports et Procès-verbaux des Réunions, Conseil Permanent International Pour L'Exploration de la Mer, 56, pp. 1-26; Report of the Sub-committee on the Comprehensive Assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Supplement), 4, pp. 230-1200; Jann, B., Allen, J., Carrillo, M., Hanquet, S., Katona, S.K., Martin, A.R., Reeves, R.R., Wenzel, F.W., Migration of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) between the Cape Verde Islands and Iceland (2003) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 5, pp. 125-129; Jonsgård, Å., The distribution of Balaenopteridae in the North Atlantic Ocean (1966) Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises, pp. 114-124. , K.

During photo-identification research we obtained 4,212 identifications of 824 humpback whales and 2,403 identifications of 908 blue whales primarily through non-systematic small-boat surveys along the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. Line-transect surveys from NOAA ships in 1991, 1993, and 1996 covered approximately 39,000 km along the coast of Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington out to 555 km from shore. The nearshore and clumped distribution of humpback whales allowed photographic identification from small boats to cost-effectively sample a substantial portion of the population, but made it difficult to obtain effective samples in the line-transect surveys covering broad areas. The humpback capture-recapture estimates indicated humpback whale abundance increased over the six years (from 569 to 837). The broader more offshore distribution of blue whales made it harder to obtain a representative sample of identification photographs, but was well suited to the line-transect estimates. The line-transect estimates, after correction for missed animals, indicated approximately 3,000 blue whales (CV = 0.14). Capture-recapture estimates of blue whales were lower than this: approximately 2,000 when using photographs obtained from the line-transect surveys as one of the samples. Comparison of the results from the two methods provides validation, as well as insight into potential biases associated with each method.","Abundance; Assessment methods; Balaenoptera musculus; Blue whale; Capture recapture; Eastern North Pacific; Humpback whale; Line transect; Megaptera novaeangliae","abundance; identification method; line transect; mark-recapture method; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northeast); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Musculus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertson, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature (London), 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.B., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urbán-R, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales, world-wide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Barlow, J., Abundance of large whales in California coastal waters: A comparison of ship surveys in 1979/80 and in 1991 (1994) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 44, pp. 399-406; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

In blue whales, concentrations of 25 PCB congeners, DDT and metabolites and several other organochlorine compounds were present at higher concentrations in the blubber of males relative to females; reflecting maternal transfer of these persistent contaminants from females into young. Sex-related differences in concentrations were not observed with less persistent contaminants, such as HCHs. In humpback whale samples, there were no significant differences in the concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine compounds in the blubber of females and calves. These data indicate that calves quickly bioaccumulate contaminants by transplacental and lactational routes to concentrations that are in equilibrium with females. In comparisons between contaminant concentrations and patterns in the blubber of female blue and humpback whales, there were no significant differences in concentrations, but the proportions of some PCB congeners, HCH isomers, and DDT and its metabolites were different in the two baleen whale species. These may reflect differences in the diet of the two species, since fish comprise a large part of the diet of humpback whales and blue whales feed exclusively on euphausiid crustaceans (i.e. krill). © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Trials with a 12,000-photographs database found no differences in match success between matching by computer and matching by comparing smaller catalogs ranging in size from 200 to 400 photographs. Tests with a 24,000-photographs database showed that, on average, the first match was found after examining about 130 photographs whether the photograph quality was excellent, good, or poor. Match success did not appear to be strongly related to whether the tail flukes had especially distinctive markings or pigment patterns (recognition quality). An advantage of computer-assisted matching is the ability to compare new photographs to the entire North Pacific collection, where no bias is introduced based on expectation of resightings within or between specific areas, or based on expectation of behavioral role (e.g. matching ""known"" females to "" known"" females).",,"computer; photograph; whale; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Hammond, P., Estimating the size of naturally marked whale populations using capture-recapture techniques (1986) Rep.

The number of voyages destined for 'Atlantic' whaling grounds and the products obtained are well known, but the number of whales killed by region is difficult to estimate partly because of uncertainty about the relative magnitude of whaling effort in the West Indies, Cape Verde Islands, and South Atlantic Ocean. We examined a random sample of logbooks from whaling voyages sailing from 1865 to 1886, stratified by port of departure and amount of whale oil returned. Based on the logbook data, we estimated the proportions of voyages that whaled for humpbacks in the West Indies and the Cape Verde Islands. We also estimated the average number of humpback whales landed in those areas per voyage. The proportions of voyages and average numbers of whales were multiplied by the total number of voyages in each stratum to estimate the number of North Atlantic humpbacks landed. The resulting estimates for the West Indies were higher than those reported by Mitchell and Reeves in 1983 and the estimates for the West Indies and the Cape Verde Islands were lower than those reported by Smith and Reeves in 2002. Our findings generally corroborate the assumptions of previous authors but improve the accuracy of removal estimates and provide measures of precision lacking in earlier studies.",,"historical record; nineteenth century; whale; whaling; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Cape Verde; Caribbean Islands; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Carib.

On the basis of multiple comparison T2 Hotelling's test and Holmes' procedure, the FST- statistics was applied to assess differentiation of four (Pacific and Atlantic) subpopulations of humpback whale Megaptera novacangliae, six populations of Californian island gray fox Urocyon littoralis, and geographically isolated Ob' and Yakutia populations of Siberian white crane Crus leucogeranus. It was shown that the regional humpback whale subpopulations do not constitute a single panmictic unit (P &lt; 10-1). The subdivision index of the Pacific and Atlantic populations expressed in terms of FST-statistics varied from 0.101 to 0.157. The differentiation estimates for the island fox populations, which ranged from 0.2109 to 0.4027, indicate that subdivision of these populations is a function of the distance between the islands, island size, and population size. In particular, the smallest and the greatest differences were found respectively between the populations of the geographically closest northern islands (FST = 0.2157, FST = 0.2109) and between those of the most distant northern and southern islands (FST = 0.4027, FST = 0.3869). Subdivision of the island populations with minimum areas and low population number was intermediate (FST = 0.3789). Mean values of heterozygosity, within-population genetic similarity index, and the number of coinciding fragments for two random individuals of Siberian white crane from the Ob' and Yakutia population were not statistically significantly different (P ≥ 0.852, (P ≥ 0.491, (P ≥ 0.325). However, pairwise comparisons of mean FST values indicated that the differentiation estimates for samples from these populations fall within the limits of population subdivision (P = 0.01). The subdivision estimate (0.108-0.133) of various groups of Siberian white cranes is comparable to interregional subdivision of humpback whale. Based on the results of this study, we recommend the approach based on modified Wright's FST-statistics for studying genetic population structure aimed at detecting population subdivision.",,"article; bird; controlled study; DNA fingerprinting; fox; genetic similarity; heterozygosity; nonhuman; population differentiation; population genetics; population size; statistical analysis; whale; animal; biological model; genetics; heterozygote; methodology; population genetics; Russian Federation; statistics; United States; variable number of tandem repeat; Grus leucogeranus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Urocyon littoralis; microsatellite DNA; Animals; Birds; California; DNA Fingerprinting; Foxes; Genetics, Population; Heterozygote; Microsatellite Repeats; Minisatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Siberia; Statistics; Whales",,,,,,,"Jeffreys, A.J., Wilson, V., Thein, S.L., Hipervariable ""mini-satellite"" regions in human DNA (1985) Nature, 314, pp. 67-70; Jeffreys, A.J., Wilson, V., Thein, S.L., Individual-specific ""fingerprints"" of human DNA (1985) Nature, 316, pp. 76-79; Russian source; Baker, C.S., Gilbert, D.A., Weinrich, M.T., Population characteristics of DNA fingerprints in humpback whales (Mecaptera novaeangliae) (1993) Heredity, 84, pp. 281-290; Aggawal, R.K., Majumdar, K.C., Lang, J.W., Generic affinities among crocodilians as revealed by DNA fingerprinting with a Bkm-derived probe (1994) Proc.

Primers complementary to the 3′- untranslated region (3′UTR) of each of the three mRNAs occurring in human, rat and mouse were synthesized and used to amplify regions of the 3′UTR from genomic DNA isolated from cetaceans, specifically from the bottled-nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncates), the pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) and the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Using several primers and PCR conditions, the three CaM genes were identified in all three species by this method with one exception. The sequenced regions of the 3′UTRs of the three genes of the cetaceans exhibited a high percentage identity when compared to the corresponding regions of these three CaM mRNAs isolated from humans (85-96%). These partial sequences of the 3′UTR regions and the corresponding regions for humans, rats and mice that were available from the database were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The three CaM genes from all species showed a close phylogenetic relationship based on these 3′UTR sequences. Such high conservation of the 3′UTRs suggests a specialized and significant function for this region in mammals.",,"calmodulin; messenger RNA; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; article; Cetacea; controlled study; dolphin; gene amplification; gene isolation; genetic conservation; mammal; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; whale; animal; Cetacea; genetics; human; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; sequence alignment; Breviceps; Cetacea; Kogia; Kogia breviceps; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Tursiops; 3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Base Sequence; Calmodulin; Cetacea; Cloning, Molecular; Conserved Sequence; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment","GENBANK: AB003082, AB063181, AB081568, AF081672, AF178845, AJ132193, AL584600, AY036120, BG439829, BG554439, BG657062, BJ030532, BJ039373, BJ041186, BJ045519, BJ055545, BJ057829, BJ068203, BJ071304, BJ094096, BJ095629, BJ098065, K01944, M19311, M27844, NM_078986, U12022, X52608, X61432","3' Untranslated Regions; Calmodulin",,,,,"Friedberg, F., Rhoads, A.R., (2001) IUBMB Life, 51, pp. 215-221; Friedberg, F., Rhoads, A.R., (2002) Mol.

With legal protection since 1955, substantial recovery is likely to have occurred, but information on abundance and rates of increase has been limited. We present an assessment of humpback whale abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean based upon capture-recapture estimates using naturally marked individuals. These data result from a long-term collaborative effort combining large-scale dedicated projects and incidental data collection, leading to extensive geographical coverage. The application of robust statistical techniques produces estimates of greater accuracy and precision than has previously been possible. Abundance estimates ranging from 5930 to 12 580 individuals, with coefficients of variation (CVs) from 0.07 to 0.39, were calculated for the West Indies breeding population using data from 1979 to 1993. The most precise estimate for the West Indies breeding population is 10 752 (CV = 0.068) for 1992 and 1993. Due to application of new analytical methods, these estimates are larger and more precise than those previously published from similar time periods. The average rate of increase for the West Indies breeding population over a 14 yr period was estimated to be 0.031 (SE = 0.005). The best available estimate for the entire North Atlantic population of humpback whales is 11 570 (95 % CI 10 290 to 13 390) based upon samples from 1992 and 1993. However, this estimate may be biased downwards to an unknown extent due to heterogeneity in capture probabilities that do not influence the West Indies estimates.","Abundance estimation; Capture-recapture; Humpback whale; Population increase","abundance estimation; fishery regulation; mark-recapture method; population growth; population size; whale; (North); Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Continued increase in humpback whales off Western Australia (1994) Rep Int WhaI Comm, 44, pp. 309-310; Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth-interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback whales (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 535-546; Best, P.B., Increase rates in severely depleted stocks of baleen whales (1993) ICES J Mar Sci, 50, pp. 169-186; Brown, M.R., Corkeron, P.J., Hale, P.T., Schultz, K.W., Bryden, M.M., Evidence for a sex-segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proc R Soc Lond Ser B, 259, pp. 229-234; Buckland, S.T., Estimation of survival rates from sightings of individually identifiable whales (1990) Rep Int Whal Comm Special Issue, 12, pp. 149-153; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., (1993) Distance Sampling, , Chapman & Hall, London; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Clapham, P.J., Robbins, J., Brown, M., Wade, P.R., Findlay, K.P., A note on probable rates of population growth in humpback whales (2000) Paper SC/52 Appendix 5, 52nd Meet Int Whal Comm.

Commercial whaling from the 1820s to the early 1900s depleted the population. A combined passive acoustic and visual survey for humpback whales was conducted to assess the current winter distribution of this species in areas where it was exploited to depletion, and to evaluate the effectiveness of using passive acoustic survey methods to detect and locate humpback whales. Visual surveys were conducted independently but simultaneously with acoustic surveys to compare both detection methods. Humpback whale song was detected throughout the entire survey area, indicating that the species continues to occupy its historical range. A total of 31 sightings were made (n = 46 individuals, including three calves). In contrast, at least 78 unique acoustic detections of different singing males was made. The greater number of whales detected acoustically demonstrated the advantage of passive acoustic methods over visual methods for detecting male singing humpback whales; however, some sightings were not detected acoustically, demonstrating that visual methods are superior for detecting non-vocalizing whales. The number of whales detected indicates that the abundance of humpbacks in the eastern and southeastern Caribbean Sea is considerably lower than it was during the 19th century whaling period, and much lower than present day abundance in the primary wintering areas in the northeastern Greater Antilles.",,"acoustic survey; detection method; spatial distribution; visual analysis; whale; Caribbean Sea; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Acevedo, A., Smultea, M.A., First records of humpback whales including calves at Golfo Dulce and Isla del Coco, Costa Rica, suggesting geographical overlap of northern and southern hemisphere populations (1995) Mar.

These variables are difficult to determine for any species but are further complicated for migratory marine mammals, such as humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae. Patterns of habitat use in relation to social organization potentially exist for this species on their wintering grounds. Using an integrated GIS approach, we examined the degree to which spatial patterns of habitat stratification are correlated within different humpback whale group types from 6 years of sighting data (1996-2001) collected on the Antongil Bay, Madagascar, wintering ground. Stratification of humpback whale sightings by behavioural classification showed significant variation in depth and distance from shore. Distribution by depth could not be described as a function of group size but could be described as a function of social organization, with mother-calf pairs showing a strong preference for shallower water compared to all other group types. Group size and social organization seem to be factors in distribution by distance from shore. Significant diurnal patterns in distribution by depth and distance from shore also exist, where mother-calf groups maintain a relatively stable distribution and pairs and competitive groups are the most variable. Patterns of habitat preference on this wintering ground appear to be guided by social organization, where distribution by depth and distance from shore highlight areas critical to conservation.","Geographical information system; Habitat preference; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Social organization","GIS; group size; habitat selection; habitat use; overwintering; social organization; whale; Madagascar; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Ackerman, J.D., Specificity and mutual dependency of the orchid-euglossine bee interaction (1983) Biol.

Identification photographs of humpback whales were collected in the Hawaiian Islands between 1977 and 1995, and sighting histories were compiled for individuals. Analyses revealed that (a) mean dates of first identification were significantly earlier for juveniles and females with no calf than for males and females with a calf off the Big Island, and significantly earlier for juveniles than for females with no calf, males and females with a calf off Maui; and (b) mean dates of last identification were significantly earlier for juveniles and females with no calf than for males and females with a calf off the Big Island, and significantly earlier for females with no calf than for males and females with a calf off Maui. A within-subjects comparison showed that the date of first identification tended to be later for individual females in the years when they had a calf than in the years during which they had no calf. It was concluded that (a) migratory timing varies as a function of age, sex and reproductive status, (b) migratory timing is intimately connected with reproductive success and (c) migratory timing has important consequences for our understanding of humpback whale behaviour on the winter grounds.",,,,,,,,,"Aidley, D.J., Questions about migration (1981) Animal Migration, pp. 1-8. , (Aidley, D.J., ed.).

Generalized additive models were used to investigate the relationships between song length and time of year, time of day, and broadcast factors. There were significant seasonal and diurnal effects. The seasonal factor was associated with changes in the density of whales sighted near shore. The diurnal factor was associated with changes in surface social activity. Songs that ended within a few minutes of the most recent ping tended to be longer than songs sung during control periods. Many songs that were overlapped by pings, and songs that ended several minutes after the most recent ping, did not differ from songs sung in control periods. The longest songs were sung between 1 and 2 h after the last ping. Humpbacks responded to louder broadcasts with longer songs. The fraction of variation in song length that could be attributed to broadcast factors was low. Much of the variation in humpback song length remains unexplained. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Broadcasting; Frequencies; Sonar; Sound recording; Diurnal effects; Acoustics; acoustics; animal experiment; article; controlled study; echolocation; frequency analyzer; intraspecific variation; low frequency noise; measurement; Megaptera novaeangliae; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; sound detection; time series analysis; vocalization; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Hawaii; Male; Regression Analysis; Seasons; Social Behavior; Social Environment; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Green, M., Acoustic interaction of humpback whales and whale-watching boats (2000) Mar.

No significant differences were observed in the number of individuals from any feeding area that were re-sighted in the common breeding area in the West Indies. However, there was a relationship between the proportion (logit transformed) of West Indies sightings and longitude (r2 = 0.97, F1.3 = 98.27, P = 0.0022) suggesting that individuals feeding farther to the east are less likely to winter in the West Indies. A relationship was also detected between sighting date in the West Indies and feeding area. Mean sighting dates in the West Indies for individuals identified in the Gulf of Maine and eastern Canada were significantly earlier than those for animals identified in Greenland, Iceland and Norway (9.97 days, t179 = 3.53, P = 0.00054). There was also evidence for sexual segregation in migration; males were seen earlier on the breeding ground than were females (6.63 days, t105 = 1.98, P = 0.050). This pattern was consistently observed for animals from all feeding areas; a combined model showed a significant effect for both sex (F1 = 5.942, P = 0.017) and feeding area (F3 = 4.756, P = 0.0038). The temporal difference in occupancy of the West Indies between individuals from different feeding areas, coupled with sexual differences in migratory patterns, presents the possibility that there are reduced mating opportunities between individuals from different high latitude areas.","Atlantic Ocean; Breeding grounds; Feeding grounds; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Segregation","breeding site; feeding ground; migration; migratory behavior; sex-related difference; temporal variation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Animalia; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Allen, J.M., Rosenbaum, H.C., Katona, S.K., Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Regional and sexual differences in fluke pigmentation of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from the North Atlantic Ocean (1994) Can.

On the basis of multiple comparison T 2 Hotelling's test and Holmes' procedure, the F ST- statistics was applied to assess differentiation of four (Pacific and Atlantic) subpopulations of humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, six populations of Californian island gray fox Urocyon littoralis, and geographically isolated Ob' and Yakutia populations of Siberian white crane Crus leucogeranus. It was shown that the regional humpback whale subpopulations do not constitute a single panmictic unit (P &lt; 10 -4). The subdivision index of the Pacific and Atlantic populations expressed in terms of F-statistics varied from 0.101 to 0.157. The differentiation estimates for the island fox populations, which ranged from 0.2109 to 0.4027, indicate that subdivision of these populations is a function of the distance between the islands, island size, and population size. In particular, the smallest and the greatest differences were found respectively between the populations of the geographically closest northern islands (F ST = 0.2157, F ST = 0.2109) and between those of the most distant northern and southern islands (F ST = 0.4027, F ST = 0.3869). Subdivision of the island populations with minimum areas and low population number was intermediate (F ST = 0.3789). Mean values of heterozygosity, within-population genetic similarity index, and the number of coinciding fragments for two random individuals of Siberian white crane from the Ob' and Yakutia population were not statistically significantly different (P ≥ 0.852, P ≥ 0.491, P ≥ 0.325). However, pairwise comparisons of mean F ST values indicated that the differentiation estimates for samples from these populations fall within the limits of population subdivision (P = 0.01). The subdivision estimate (0.108-0.133) of various groups of Siberian white cranes is comparable to interregional subdivision of humpback whale. Based on the results of this study, we recommend the approach based on modified Wright's F ST-statistics for studying genetic population structure aimed at detecting population subdivision.",,"DNA; article; DNA fingerprinting; geography; nonhuman; population genetics; randomization; Russian Federation; statistical analysis; whale; Canidae; Cetacea; Gruidae; Grus leucogeranus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Urocyon cinereoargenteus; Urocyon littoralis",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 99-04-48373

The behavior involves the whale positioned vertically in the water column with its tail in the air. With the exception of calves, tail-up was observed in all social classes, and its frequency increased through the end of the season. Tail-ups were recorded in 144 (5.8%) of 2,465 groups of whales observed from a shore station, and in 297 (14.9%) of 1,996 groups observed from vessel surveys; biases in each method suggest that the true frequency lies between these sources. One hundred and fifty-two hours of continuous sampling showed that the duration of tail-up events lasted from a few seconds to 12 min and was longest in groups comprised of a single adult. The maximum duration of a recorded period that consistently included tail-up was 10 h; however, some individuals were observed to engage in the behavior at night and for four consecutive days. Tail-up movement speed did not vary by social class; however, it varied according to wind direction and speed. The characteristics of tail-up that we observed showed that it differed from the descriptions of similar behaviors in other cetacean species. The function of tail-up is unknown, but we suggest that it may be a multifunctional behavior.","Abrolhos Bank; Behavior; Breeding ground; Continuous sampling; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Scan-counts; Shore station; Theodolite tracking","positioning; swimming behavior; whale; Abrolhos Bank; Atlantic Ocean; Bahia State; Brazil; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior and sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 226-267; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Balcomb, K.C., Nichols, G., Humpback whale censuses in the West Indies (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 401-406; Brodie, P.F., Cetacean energetics: An overview of intraspecific size variation (1975) Ecology, 56, pp. 152-161; Brodie, P.F., Form, function and energetics of Cetacea: A discussion (1977) Functional Anatomy of Marine Mammals, 3, pp. 45-58. , R.

In the decades from 1800 to 1860, whaling effort consisted of a few localized, small-scale, shore-based enterprises on the coast of Maine and Cape Cod, Mass. Provincetown and Nantucket schooners occasionally conducted short cruises for humpback whales in New England waters. With the development of bomb-lance technology at mid century, the ease of killing humpback whales and fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, increased. As a result, by the 1870's there was considerable local interest at hunting rorquals (baleen whales in the family Balaenopteridae, which include the humpback and fin whales) in the Gulf of Maine. A few schooners were specially outfitted to take rorquals in the late 1870's and 1880's although their combined annual take was probably no more than a few tens of whales. Also in about 1880, fishing steamers began to be used to hunt whales in the Gulf of Maine. This steamer fishery grew to include about five vessels regularly engaged in whaling by the mid 1880's but dwindled to only one vessel by the end of the decade. Fin whales constituted at least half of the catch, which exceeded 100 animals in some years. In the late 1880's and thereafter, few whales were taken by whaling vessels in the Gulf of Maine.",,"fishery; historical record; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Gadus morhua; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Mem.

Maternal lineage haplotypes were obtained for 323 whales, either from direct sequencing of the mtDNA control region (n = 159) or inferred from known relationships along matrilines from the sequenced sample of individuals (n = 164). Sequence variation in the 550 bp of the control region defined a total of 19 maternal lineage haplotypes that formed two main clades. Fecundity increased significantly over the study period among females of several lineages among the two clades. Individual maternal lineages and other clades were characterized by significant variation in fecundity. The detected heterogeneity of reproductive success has the potential to substantially affect the frequency and distribution of maternal lineages found in this population over time. There were significant yearly effects on adult resighting rates and calf survivorship based on examination of sighting histories with varying capture-recapture probability models. These results indicate that population structure can be influenced by interactions or associations between reproductive success, genetic structure, and environmental factors in a natural population of long-lived mammals.",,"genomic DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal cell; animal tissue; article; birth rate; breeding; cladistics; consensus sequence; demography; DNA sequence; environmental factor; fertility; gene structure; genealogy; genetic analysis; genetic variability; haplotype; life history trait; Megaptera novaeangliae; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; population genetic structure; population model; population structure; priority journal; probability; reproduction; seasonal variation; sequence analysis; skin biopsy; survival rate; whale; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Fertility; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Maine; Population Density; Reproduction; Seawater; Variation (Genetics); Whales; Animalia; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,"DNA, Mitochondrial",,,"American Museum of Natural History, AMNH","From the Molecular Systematics Laboratory, American Museum of Natural History, 79th Street and CPW, New York, NY 10024 (Rosenbaum and DeSalle); Wildlife Conservation Society, Science Resource Center 2300 Southern Blvd., Bronx, NY 10460 (Rosen-baum); Whale Center of New England, P.O.

Using underwater videogrammetry, we measured body lengths of 17 principal escorts, 68 secondary escorts, 40 single escorts, 17 male partners, and 8 singers. Results revealed that (i) principal escorts were, on average, significantly larger than males in each of the remaining social roles except singer, (ii) singers were significantly larger than male partners, (iii) there were no significant size differences among secondary escorts, single escorts, or male partners. Further, principal escorts tended to be the largest or second-largest male within their individual competitive group. All principal escorts were of sizes that indicated a 0.81 probability or better of sexual maturity, based on whaling data. In comparison, more than half of the male partners, almost one-third of the secondary escorts, and one-fifth of the single escorts were of sizes that indicated a 0.5 probability or less of sexual maturity. Seven of the eight singers had a 0.9 probability or better of sexual maturity and the eighth singer a 0.5 probability. However, the data for singers are too few to allow firm conclusions to be reached about the relation of body size to singing. Overall, our findings suggest that body size confers an advantage in physical competition between male humpback whales, and that a large proportion of males adopting the role of secondary escort, single escort, and partner are likely to be sexually immature. Additionally, the competitive group appears to be a major reproductive unit in terms of bringing together a receptive female and potential mates.",,"Probability; Social aspects; Underwater equipment; Underwater videogrammetry; Biodiversity; body size; social behavior; whale; United States; Cetacea; Hawaiia; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Can.

Analyses of identification photographs collected in Hawai'i from 1976 through 1995 and scan samples collected in 1998 showed that (i) reproductive potential (calving rate) for the following winter was greater for females without a calf than females with a calf, (ii) females without a calf were less likely to be found alone and more likely to be found in large pods than females with a calf, (iii) individual females were found in larger pods when without a calf than when with a calf, (iv) the probability of females with a calf being escorted by one or more males increased as the reproductive season progressed, and (v) head lunges occurred more commonly in all-adult pods than in pods containing a calf. We concluded that male humpback whales associate preferentially with females with high reproductive potential, that the attractiveness of individual females varies with their status (with a calf versus without a calf), that males become progressively less choosy over the course of the reproductive season as females without a calf become increasingly rare on the winter grounds, and that males expend more energy in competition over females without a calf than females with a calf.",,"Ecosystems; Photointerpretation; Probability; Reproductive potential; Biodiversity; competition (ecology); intrasexual interaction; male behavior; mate choice; reproductive status; whale; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Almquist, J.O., Amann, R.P., O'Dell, W.T., Sperm reserves of dairy bulls as determined by depletion trials and postslaughter sperm counts (1958) J.

Such cases could be due to reciprocal altruism brought on by exceptional circumstances, for example the presence of abundant shoaling fish. An alternative explanation is that these behaviours have evolved through kin selection. With little restriction to either communication or movement, diffuse groups of relatives could maintain some form of social organization without the need to travel in tight-nit units. To try to distinguish between these hypotheses, we took advantage of the fact that migrating humpback whales often swim together in small groups. If kin selection is important in humpback whale biology, these groups should be enriched for relatives. Consequently, we analysed biopsy samples from 57 groups of humpback whales migrating off Eastern Australia in 1992. A total of 142 whales were screened for eight microsatellite markers. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (371 bp) were also used to verify and assist kinship identification. Our data add support to the notion that mothers travel with their offspring for the first year of the calf's life. However, beyond the presence of mother-calf/yearling pairs, no obvious relatedness pattern was found among whales sampled either in the same pod or on the same day. Levels of relatedness did not vary between migratory phases (towards or away from the breeding ground), nor between the two sexes considered either overall or in the north or south migrations separately. These findings suggest that, if any social organization does exist, it is formed transiently when needed rather than being a constant feature of the population, and hence is more likely based on reciprocal altruism than kin selection.","Cetaceans; Kinship; Microsatellites; Migration; Relatedness; Social behaviour","Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Phthiraptera; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; animal behavior; article; family; female; gene frequency; genetics; genotype; male; physiology; population migration; whale; Animal Migration; Animals; Behavior, Animal; DNA, Mitochondrial; Family; Female; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Whales","GENBANK: AF419261, AF419262, AF419263, AF419264, AF419265, AF419266, AF419267, AF419268, AF419269, AF419270, AF419271","DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,,"Allen, P.J., Amos, W., Pomeroy, P.P., Twiss, S.D., Microsatellite variation in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) shows evidence of genetic differentiation between two British breeding colonies (1995) Molecular Ecology, 4, pp. 653-662; Amos, W., Schlotterer, C., Tautz, D., Social structure of pilot whales revealed by analytical DNA profiling (1993) Science, 260, pp. 670-672; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Seasonal contrast in the behaviour of the humpback whale (1984) Cetus, 5, pp. 14-16; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Bannister, J.L., Abundant mitochondrial DNA variation and world-wide population structure in humpback whales (1993) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA, 90, pp. 8239-8243; Brown, M., Corkeron, P., Pod characteristics of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the East Australian coast (1995) Behaviour, 132, pp. 163-179; Brown, M., Corkeron, P., Hale, P., Schultz, K., Bryden, M., Evidence for a sex-segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London - Series B, 259, pp. 229-234; Bryden, M., Studies of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), Area V.

These were compiled by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. Only 2.9% of the sightings were collected outside of Milford and Doubtful Sounds since most of the sampling effort was concentrated in these two fiords. In addition to species identification, group size and location were also recorded. Nine species were identified: bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops sp.), dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), common dolphin (Delphinus sp.), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala malaena edwardi), orca (Orcinus orca), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and sperm whale (Physeter catodon). These are the first official records of long-finned pilot whale and minke whale in the region. Bottlenose dolphins were the most commonly observed species in all areas (87.8% of all sightings), followed by dusky dophins (10.3%). Along the coastline outside the fiords, bottlenose dolphins were also the predominant species (48.1% of sightings, n = 27), followed again by dusky dolphin (33.3%). Observations from this sighting network were compared with studies, which used standard sampling techniques, undertaken in the area. Spatial and temporal variations in tour operator sightings were accurate and reliabce. Estimates of dolphin group size were accurate up to 25 individuals. If the group was larger than 25 animals, its size was overestimated by tour operators. Species distribution at a large scale (Fiordland coastline) and small scale (within Doubtful and Milford Sounds) is discussed. Temporal variations in distribution and group size were also assessed; observer bias was taken into consideration.","Abundance estimates; Bottlenose dolphin; Cetaceans; Common dolphin; Dusky dolphin; Fiordland; Humpback whale; Long-finned pilot whale; Minke whale; New Zealand; Orca; Sightings; Southern right whale; Sperm whale","cetacean; observational method; population estimation; species occurrence; New Zealand; Tasman Sea; Animalia; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Eubalaena australis; Globicephala; Globicephala melas; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus obscurus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Barr, K., Slooten, E., Effects of tourism on dusky dolphins in Kaikoura (1999) Conservation Advisory Science Notes, 229. , 28 p.

For many years the research community has believed that the Hawaiian Islands serve as one of the winter calving grounds for the North Pacific humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae. Direct evidence, however, had not been reported. In 1997 the analysis of a large placenta encountered in the Hawaiian winter grounds of the humpback whale was documented but definitive identification of the source species was not possible. In this report we describe the DNA sequence analysis, by polymerase chain reaction, which was performed on the tissue obtained from that placenta to identify its source. It was concluded from the analysis that the unknown placental tissue originated from a humpback whale. These results have important implications concerning humpback whale reproduction, since this molecular confirmation serves as direct evidence of a humpback whale birth in the Hawaiian winter grounds.",,"Biodiversity; Enzymes; Molecular biology; Tissue; Molecular confirmations; DNA sequences; DNA; genetic analysis; molecular analysis; whale; DNA sequence; geographic origin; island (geological); Pacific Ocean; placenta; polymerase chain reaction; United States; whale; Cetacea; Hawaiia; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

All records of sirenians and cetaceans for Grenada were assembled and analyzed. The total number of confirmed marine mammal species for this part of the world is 11. The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) was the most commonly reported mysticete species while a variety of odontocetes seem to be equally frequent in those waters. The manatee (Trichechus manatus) has been extinct from those waters for at least 300 years. Comparison with the marine mammal fauna of adjacent regions (Venezuela, Trinidad, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), leads us to believe that at least seven additional species of cetaceans may be present in Grenadian waters, probably as occasional visitors.","Caribbean; Conservation status; Distribution; Grenada (West Indies); Marine mammals","conservation status; geographical distribution; marine mammal; Caribbean Sea; Grenada; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Sirenia; Trichechus; Trichechus manatus; Trichechus manatus; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribb.

It is hoped that through the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) new knowledge about whales can be gained. The whale makes sounds, and especially the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes a specific sound called ""a song"". We started our project to develop the technology for AUVs to follow and observe humpback whales by analyzing their songs and locating them underwater. A small size passive SONAR was designed, fabricated, and fitted on the AUV AQUA EXPLORER 2000. An observation experiment was conducted in March 2001 off the Kerama Islands, Okinawa. Prior to our studies, there were no examples of AUV observations on whales anywhere in the world. This experimental observation was conducted as a joint project of the Underwater Technology Research Center at the Institute of Industrial Science in the University of Tokyo, KDDI Co. Research Institute, and the Okinawa EXPO Aquarium. The AUV succeeded in detecting a humpback whale underwater and approaching it within 50m in this experiment.",,"Ecology; Ocean habitats; Sonar; Underwater vehicles; Marine engineering; sonar; song; underwater vehicle; whale; Japan; Kerama Islands; Okinawa; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., Hanson, M.B., (1996) Dall's Porpoise Diving Behavior and Reactions to Tagging Attempts using Remotely Deployed Suction Cup Tag; Otani, S., Naito, Y., Kawamura, A., Kawasaki, M., Nishiwaki, S., Kato, A., (1998) Diving Behavior and Performance of Harbor Porpoises, 14, pp. 209-220. , Phocoena phocoena, in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan; Iwakami, H., Ura, T., Fuji, T., Asakawa, K., Nose, Y., Bahl, R., Fukuchi, T., (2000) Observation of Whale by Autonomous Underwater Vehicle -1st Report: Equipment, 52 (7), pp. 312-315. , Seisan-Kenkyu; Iwakami, H., Ura, T., Fuji, T., Asakawa, K., Kojima, J., Asai, T., Higashi, N., Fukuchi, T., (2000) Observation of Whale by Autonomous Underwater Vehicle -2nd Report: Preliminary Trials off Zamami Islands, 52 (7), pp. 316-319. , Seisan-Kenkyu; Asakawa, K., Aqua Exporer2, Seisan-Kenkyu, 52 (7), pp. 297-303; Kojima, K., Asai, T., Shirasaki, Y., Asakawa, K., (2000) Development of New Auv 'Aqua Explorer 2000' and its Cable Tracking Sensor, , UUST01; Ura, T., Takagawa, S., (1997) Underwater Robots, , Tokyo: Seizando. 309pp","Iwakami, H.; University of Tokyo Post Grad.

This study considered whether such responses would lead to changes in distribution and abundance. A land-based shore station measured humpback whale locations (scan samples) for both nearshore (<5 km) and offshore (5-10 km) areas. Control observations were made in 1994 and 1998. In 1998 multiple-day blocks with ATOC transmissions were interspersed with multiple-day control blocks without transmissions. Sighting rates were higher in 1998 (ATOC) than in 1994 (control year), probably due to better sighting conditions, but may reflect increased population size. Sighting rates did not differ between control and ATOC conditions in 1998. A seasonal sighting peak was observed in both years. No vessel effect on sighting rate was detected in 1998. There was no effect of ATOC on the distance from the shore station to whales, or the depth of water where pods were located. However, the distribution of whales shifted slightly eastward during the ATOC blocks and the mean distance between the ATOC source and pods was greater during transmissions. Nonetheless, more whales were found close to the source when it was on, suggesting a more variable response rather than simple avoidance, with whales found both closer to, and farther away from, the source during transmissions.","Abundance; ATOC; Distribution; Humpback whale; Low-frequency noise; Megaptera novaeangliae","abundance; diving behavior; noise; spatial distribution; whale; Hawaii; Kauai; United States; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 337-367; (1995) Final environmental impact statement for the Kauai Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate project and its associated Marine Mammal Research Program, , 290 pp. Available from Advanced Research Projects Administration, 3701 N.

J0P 1H0, Canada","The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes aboriginal subsistence whaling to be distinct from commercial whaling, and these two broad categories of whaling are subject to different management approaches. This paper describes recent, ongoing and likely future whale hunts that qualify, or may qualify, for aboriginal subsistence status within the IWC's management framework. To ensure conservation of the whale populations, a forthright exposition of the origins, development and character of these hunts is needed in addition to stock assessment, a risk-averse catch limit algorithm and appropriate mechanisms within the whaling communities to ensure compliance. The hunts for Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) and Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Arctic and North Pacific, respectively, and Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Indonesia have long histories and local origins. Those for Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Lesser Antilles and at Tonga in the South Pacific were introduced by foreign commercial whalers. Whale hunting in the Philippines appears to have originated both locally and as a result of foreign influence. The relatively recent initiation of whaling for Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland required introduced technology but can be viewed as a modern adaptation of an ancient tradition. Consensus in deciding how to classify and manage non-industrial whaling has been, and will remain, elusive. Even with common definitions of key terms such as 'subsistence', 'commercial' and 'aboriginal', interpretations will depend on whether one's priorities are whale-centred or human-centred.","Bowhead Whale; Bryde's Whale; Conservation; Fin Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Minke Whale; Sperm Whale; Whales; Whaling","commercial activity; conservation management; subsistence; whale; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribbean Studies, 11, pp. 55-74; Adams, J.E., Shore whaling in St Vincent Island, West Indies (1973) Caribbean Quarterly, 19, pp. 42-50; Adams, J.E., Primitive whaling in the West Indies (1975) Sea Frontiers, 21, pp. 303-313; Adams, J.E., Last of the Caribbean whalemen (1994) Natural History, 103 (11), pp. 64-71; Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Akimichi, T., Asquith, P.J., Befu, H., Bestor, T.C., Braund, S.R., Freeman, M.M.R., Hardacre, H., Takahashi, J., (1988) Small-Type Coastal Whaling in Japan.

Although no confirmed DA toxicity events have been reported in whales, here we present data demonstrating that humpback and blue whales are exposed to the toxin and consume DA contaminated prey. Whale fecal samples were found to contain DA at levels ranging from 10 to 207μg DA g-1 feces via HPLC-UV methods. SEM analysis of whale feces containing DA, collected from krill-feeding whales, revealed the presence of diatom frustules identified as Pseudo-nitzschia australis, a known DA producer. Humpback whales were observed feeding on anchovies and sardines that contained DA at levels ranging from 75 to 444μg DA g-1 viscera. DA contamination of whale feces and fish occurred only during blooms of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia. Additionally, several novel fish species collected during a toxic diatom bloom were tested for DA. Fish as diverse as benthic sanddabs and pelagic albacore were found to contain the neurotoxin, suggesting that DA permeates benthic as well as pelagic communities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Observers scanned for cetaceans with 25x (Big Eye) binoculars from the flying bridge (platform height = 12m) at survey speeds of 18.5-22 km h-1 (10-12 knots). Transect survey effort was 1761 km in 1999, in a study area 196,885 km2; and 2194 km in 2000, in a study area 158,561 km2. An additional 609 and 402 km of trackline was surveyed in 1999 and 2000, respectively, while in transit to or from pollock survey way points. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) the most common small cetacean in both regions. In the CEBS (1999), uncorrected cetacean abundance estimates were: 3368 (CV = 0.29) fin whales, 810 (CV = 0.36) minke whales (B. acutorostrata), 14,312 (CV = 0.26) Dall's porpoise and 693 (CV = 0.53) harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). In the SEBS (2000), uncorrected abundance estimates were: 683 (CV = 0.32) fin whales, 102 (CV = 0.50) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), 1003 (CV = 0.26) minke whales, 9807 (CV = 0.20) Dall's porpoise and 1958 (CV = 0.21) harbor porpoise. These are the first estimates of cetacean abundance that can be directly compared between two regions of the eastern Bering Sea. Distributions of some species were associated with bathymetric features, and there were occasions when prey associations were obvious. For example, in the SEBS, fin whales occurred on the Middle Shelf (50-100 m) and on the Outer Shelf (100-200 m) near the Pribilof canyon, but in the CEBS fin whales occurred primarily on the Outer Shelf along the 200 m isobath (i.e. the Green Belt). Fin whales were sometimes associated with echo-sounder backscatter from a mixture of fish schools and zooplankton. Humpback whales were also seen on the Middle Shelf, near the 50-m contour where the Inner Front often develops. Non-pollock echosigns observed near cetaceans, some of which may have been cetacean prey, were not routinely identified during trawl sampling because the research focus was on pollock abundance assessment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using the multiple logistic regression, sightings of cetaceans during the 1990-1996 summer (June-September) surveys were modeled with oceanographic (sea surface temperature, monthly probability of front occurrence) and topographic (depth, slope) variables for the same period. Predicted habitat maps for June and August were created for each species using a Geographical Information System. The predicted habitat locations matched with current and historic cetacean sighting locations. The model also predicted habitat shifts for some species associated with oceanographic changes. The correct classification rate of the prediction models with 1997-1998 summer survey data ranged from 44% to 70%, of which most of the misclassifications were caused by false positives (i.e., absence of sightings at locations where the models predicted).","Cetaceans; Geographical Information System; Habitat prediction model; Western North Atlantic Ocean","cetacean; GIS; model; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; (North); Atlantic Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Stenella (Cetacea); Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Au, D.W.K., Perryman, W.L., Dolphin habitats in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (1985) Fishery Bulletin, U.S., 83, pp. 623-644; Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Cetaceans of the western tropical Indian Ocean: Distribution, relative abundance, and comparisons with cetacean communities of two other tropical ecosystems (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14, pp. 429-459; Cayula, J.F., Cornillon, P.C., Multi-image edge detection for SST images (1995) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 12, pp. 821-829; (1982) A Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid- and North Atlantic Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, , Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, University of Rhode Island.

Currently (April 2001), 19 permits, comprising 31 ships and two aircraft, allow whalewatching in the GBRMP. The combined passenger capacity of these craft is 3,238 at any one time (e.g., per day). However, fewer than 15,000 persons were recorded in 'dedicated' whalewatching tours each month during the May - October 'whale-watching' season between 1998 and 2000. Watching M. novaeangliae occurs primarily in the Central and Cairns Sections of the GBRMP, with most activity focused in the Whitsundays. Permitted levels of whale-watching are capped at eight permits in the Cairns Area, and at 11 permits in the Whitsundays. Other tours include: a specialised form of whale-watching involving swimming with B. acutorostrata which is being brought within a limited-entry management regime; one dolphin-watching tour in the Central Section of the GBRMP north of the Whitsundays; and one dugong-watching tour in the Hinchinbrook Region. Because of reported declines in the number of D. dugon on the Great Barrier Reef, this activity is being monitored closely before further permits are granted. Marine mammal watching activities in the GBRMP are managed through a combination of best practices guidelines, codes of conduct, regulations, zoning, wildlife protection areas and permits. The potential for the commercial whale-watching industry to become self-regulating is acknowledged.","Dolphin; Dugong; Dwarf minke whale; Great Barrier Reef; Humpback whale; Tourism; Whale-watching",,,,,,,,"Anderson, P.K., (1997) Commercial Dugong Tourism at Shark Bay.

These surveys included humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), for which biopsy sampling and photo-identification were also undertaken. Data gathered during the 1997/98 summer season indicate that the humpback whale is the most commonly seen cetacean in the surveyed areas. Its high encounter rate (0.32 whale/nautical mile) was followed by minke whales, Balaenoptera spp. (0.14 whale/nautical mile), killer whale, Orcinus orca (0.03 whale/nautical mile), sei whale, B. borealis (0.01 whale/nautical mile) and other unidentified animals (0.004 whale/nautical mile). The highest encounter rate for humpback whales was in the Gerlache Strait (0.42 whale/nautical mile; CV = 55.5%), where encounter rates were obtained from six surveys (1997/98), three surveys (98/99) and two surveys (99/00), allowing for inter-annual comparisons. Although a decrease in the mean encounter rate of humpback whales in the Gerlache Strait was observed over the period, Anova and Kruskal-Wallis tests showed no statistical significance. A longer time series would be necessary to draw conclusions with respect to temporal trends.",,"population density; population distribution; whale; Antarctica; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera borealis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"Armstrong, W.A., Curry, B.E., Hewitt, R.P., Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) feeding behaviour in Antarctic waters: Herding and concentration of krill (1998) Abstracts of the World Marine Mammals Conference Monaco, , 20-24 January, 1998; Bathmann, U.V., Scharek, R., Klaas, C., Dubischar, C.D., Smetacek, V., Spring development of phytoplankton biomass and composition in major water masses of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (1997) Deep Sea Research, 44 (1-2), pp. 51-67; Breiwick, J.M., Braham, H.W., The status of endangered whales (1984) Marine Fisheries Review, 46 (4), pp. 15-44. , eds; Brierley, A.S., Demer, D.A., Watkins, J.L., Heiwitt, R.P., Concordance of interannual fluctuations in acoustically estimated densities of Antarctic krill around South Georgia and Elephant Island: Biological evidence of same-year teleconnections across the Scotia Sea (1999) Marine Biology, 134, pp. 675-681; Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski) (1965) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 16, pp. 33-128; Dalla Rosa, L., Secchi, E.R., Zerbini, A.N., Moller, L.M., Cetacean sightings in western South Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans (1996) Abstracts of the 7th Reunion de Trabajos de Especialistas en Mamiferos Acuaticos de America del Sur Viña del Mar, 22-25 October, 1996; Dalla Rosa, L., Secchi, E.R., Kinas, P.G., Santos, M.C.O., Zerbini, A.N., Bassoi, M., Photo-identification and density estimation of humpback whales in Antarctic waters (1999) Abstracts of the 13th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, , Maui, 28 November - 03 December, 1999; Dalla Rosa, L., Secchi, E.R., Kinas, P.G., Santos, M.C.O., Martins, M.B., Zerbini, A.N., Bethlem, C.B.P., Photo-identification of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, off the Antarctic Peninsula from 1997/98 to 1999/2000 (2001) Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, 47 (2), pp. 555-561; Dawbin, W.H., Movements of humpback whales marked in the southwest Pacific Ocean 1952 to 1962 (1964) Norsk Hvalfangsttid, 53 (3), pp. 68-78; Dawbin, W.H., The seasonal migratory cycle of humpback whales (1966) Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises, pp. 145-170. , Norris K.S.

Since 1991 the Queensland Shark Control Programme of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has developed an acoustic alarm by catch reduction strategy. Four acoustic alarm types attached to gillnets have been utilised in an attempt to 'warn' humpback whales of the presence of these man-made obstacles. Another alarm type, under development, has been distributed to commercial fisheries operating in Queensland waters to reduce the risk of humpback whale entanglement in commercial gear. A standard acoustic warning protocol is under development for humpback whales, integrating specific alarm source levels, acoustic propagation and ambient noise levels. How relevant to humpback whales this standard will be is not clear, however it should provide a benchmark against which whale entanglement, or lack of it, may be compared.

The following year, the same animal (based on comparison of photographs of dorsal fin shape) was observed and extensively photographed in Hervey Bay, Queensland. Since then, more than 50 reports of white whale sightings have been obtained with reports in every year except 1997. The whale appears to be an albino and is the only documented occurrence of an all-white humpback whale. Sightings of this unusual animal provide important information on the migratory characteristics of humpback whales along the east coast of Australia. We investigated all known reports of a white whale from 1991-2000 and applied a scale of verifiability to each report. We plotted the location and time of each reliable sighting and summarised the range, rate of movement, social patterns and annual changes in migratory characteristics based on these reports.

A suite of 10 microsatellite markers was selected for this study, based on recommendations made by ANZECC and discussions with other research groups. Seven of the 10 markers were successfully used to genotype 12 sloughed skin samples from humpback whales on their northern migration along the east coast of Australia, resulting in 11 individual whales being identified. Two samples, collected from the same pod of whales, were found to be from one individual, as the genotypes of both samples were identical, while two further samples identified a pair of whales as a possible parent/offspring combination. In order to establish a worldwide database incorporating genetic and photographic identification of humpback whales, results must be standardised between research groups. To overcome potential technical difficulties of standardising results, we recommend that each research group sequence a reference sample or group of reference samples for each locus and that results are reported in repeat number rather than absolute PCR product size.",,"microsatellite DNA; genotype; identification method; photography; whale; animal skin; Australia; coastal waters; data base; genotype; microsatellite marker; photography; process optimization; sample; species identification; tandem repeat; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bain, D., Examining the validity of inferences drawn from photo-identification data, with special reference to studies of the Killer whale (Orcinus orca) in British Columbia (1990) Individual Recognition of Cetaceans: Use of Photo-identification and Other Techniques to Estimate Population Parameters, (12 SPEC.

The area is shallow with a mean depth of 30m and a group of five islands (the Abrolhos Archipelago) is located in the northern portion of the Bank. Data collected from 1992 to 1998 were analysed to identify possible different habitat use patterns by different humpback whale group types. An analysis of variance found differences in the mean water depths where different group types were recorded: single whales, 18.9m (se = 0.505); pairs, 18.6m (se = 0.386); competitive groups, 19.1m (se = 0.573); mother-calf pairs, 15.8m (se = 0.373); mother-calf-principal escort, 14.9m (se = 0.489); and competitive group with mother-calf pair, 16.4m (se = 0.889). With the exception of competitive groups, those containing calves (mother-calf alone or mother-calf-principal escort) occured in significantly shallower water than non-calf groups (Turkey test, p&lt;0.05). In addition, groups containing calves were found significantly more often nearer the Archipelago (within 4 nautical miles) than other groups (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0.139; X2 = 18.516, p&lt;0.05). Accordingly, a spatially stratified management scheme is recommended in order to protect mother-calf pairs from possible harassment by whale watching operations in the area.",,"habitat use; reproduction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Migration and local movement of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) through Hawaiian waters (1981) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 59, pp. 460-469; Bauer, G.B., Mobley, J.R., Herman, L.M., Responses of wintering humpback whales to vessel traffic (1993) Journal of the Acoustic Society America, 94 (3 PART 2), p. 1848; Castro, B.M., Miranda, L.B., Physical oceanography of the Western Atlantic continental shelf located between 4° N and 34° S coastal segment (4, W) (1998) The Sea, 11 (8), pp. 209-251; Cartwright, R., The impact of escort associations on humpback whales calves whilst in nursery waters- a cost and benefit analysis (1999) Abstracts of the 13th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, p. 30. , Maui - Hawaii, Nov 28 - Dec 3 1999; Chittleborough, R.G., Aerial observations on the Humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre), with notes on other species (1953) Australian Journal of Marine Freshwater Research, 4 (2), pp. 219-227; Clapham, P.J., Palsboll, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Vasquez, O., Composition and dynamics of humpback whale competitive groups in the West Indies (1992) Behavior, 122 (3-4), pp. 182-194; Clapham, P.J., Social organization of humpback whales on a North Atlantic feeding ground (1993) Symposia of the Zoological Society of London, 66, pp. 131-145; Clapham, P.J., Mead, J.G., Megaptera novaeangliae (1999) Mammalian Species No 604, pp. 1-9; Dawbin, W.H., The seasonal migratory cycle of humpback whales (1966) Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises, pp. 145-170. , Norris, K.S.

These demonstrated a high rate of population increase, at least between 1982 and 1991, of ~10% per year. Surveys were conducted over 10 'good' days in mid-July in an area off Shark Bay, WA, where humpback whales were taken in the last years of Australian whaling, to 1963. The 1994 survey confirmed the increase rate with an estimated population of 4-5,000. The most recent survey, in 1999, planned to obtain an estimate of absolute abundance, was considerably affected by poor weather (only 15 'good' days' flying were possible out of 30 planned over two months). Nevertheless, applying a correction factor for animals missed while submerged to the estimated number of animals sighted gives the 1999 population size within 8,207-13,640. The result is dependent on 'deep diving' time and would be proportionally lower should this dive time be less than the range used (10-15 minutes). We review reported rates of increase and population estimates for this stock in the Antarctic, as well as preliminary Southern Hemisphere population estimates that take account of much larger than officially reported catches in the 1950s-60s. Plans for future surveys are discussed. The population's exploitation history is briefly reviewed.",,"aerial survey; population estimation; population growth; whale; Indian Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second Symposium on Information Theory, , Petran, B.N. & F.

Of the 24 records, 4 were published reports and 20 collected by the authors. Significantly more animals were found dead or entangled during the 1996-2000 period (n = 18), than previous years 1986-1990 and 1991-95 (n = 6). Of all deaths and harassments 54.2% were calves, 41.7% adults and 4.2% juveniles, with the number of calves being significantly high, considering that the calf vs adult population ratio was consistent with 3:7 hypotheses. Deaths/harassments were more common in the Negritos Banks area (54%), followed by the Gorgona-mainland (21%), Bahía Solano-Utría sound (12.5%) and other areas (12.5%). Greatest incidence (87.5%) was in the second half of the year: August (n = 6), September (n = 5) and October (n = 6). Two calf strandings were recorded early in the year, one in February and one in April and probably originated from the Northern Hemisphere population. Annual frequency of occurrence over the 15-year period indicates an increasing trend of entanglement and vessel strike since 1996.

The stock that passes close to the coast of southeast Queensland has been extensively surveyed visually, but little is known of movements of whales that pass out of sight of land here, or in other areas of the world, where the migratory paths of humpback whales are often across open ocean. Acoustic surveying may be useful in quantifying whale movements in oceanic waters beyond the range of land surveying and an addition to visual monitoring. For acoustic surveys to be of use, the acoustic cues of the whales must be quantified and calibrated against the numbers of whales in an area. In 1997 we performed a combined visual and acoustic survey of whales migrating close to shore on the coast of southeast Queensland. Song activity was measured using two indices: number of passing singers and number of singer-hours observed within a 10km sector, and correlated with the number of whales passing through the area determined visually. Both were significantly correlated with r = 0.68 and 0.64 for singers and singer-hours respectively on a daily basis, and 0.79 and 0.89 respectively on a weekly basis. Linear regressions of daily measures of song activity with numbers of whales seen lead to estimates of ratios of singers with whales seen of 0.127 ± 0.027 (95% confidence interval) and singer-hours with whales seen of 0.288 ± 0.065. We discuss the possible use of these indices for conducting stand-alone acoustic surveys.",,"migration; survey; vocalization; whale; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Mobley, J., Burgess, W.C., Lammers, M.O., Nachtigall, P.E., Seasonal and diurnal trends of chorusing humpback whales wintering in waters off western Maui (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16 (3), pp. 530-544; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Population characteristics and migration of summer and late-season humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in southeastern Alaska (1985) Marine Mammal Science, 1 (4), pp. 304-323; Bannister, J.L., Southern right (Eubalaena australis) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales off Western Australia: Some recent work (1985) Studies of Sea Mammals in South Latitudes, pp. 105-114. , Ling, J.R. & Bryden, M.M.

Prof. Elie, Rio Grande, RS 96200-970, Brazil","During three summer seasons (1997/98-1999/00), photographic sampling of humpback whales was conducted by Projeto Baleia/Brazilian Antarctic Programme in waters of the Antarctic Peninsula. Whales photographed totalled: 63 (1997/1998), 70 (1998/1999) and 21 (1999/2000). Of these, 74.6% (n = 47), 87.1% (n = 61) and 100% (n = 21), respectively, were represented by photographs categorised as quality 1 (excellent) or 2 (moderate). Inter-annual comparisons showed two matches: a whale photographed on 27 January 1998 in the Gerlache Strait was resighted on 11 January 1999 in the same region; the second on 3 February 1998 in the Gerlache Strait was resighted on 25 January 1999 at almost the same coordinates. These matches indicate that humpback whales may show fidelity to feeding grounds off the Antarctic Peninsula. Intra-annual comparisons showed two matches: a whale photographed on 22 January 1998 close to the King George Island and another on 27 January 1998 in the Bismarck Strait were resighted together on 7 March 1998 in the Gerlache Strait. Average indices of fluke colouration obtained for 1997/1998 and 1998/1999 were 2.39 (n = 44) and 2.60 (n = 53), respectively. Total average index, including photographs from the three periods, resulted in 2.54 (n = 116). All values are significantly different from those obtained by Rosenbaum et al. (1995) for western and eastern Australia (p<0.001) and similar to that found for Colombia (p >0.05) (non-parametric test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov). These results reinforce the view that humpback whales feeding in the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula probably originate from eastern South Pacific breeding grounds.",,"identification method; photography; whale; Antarctica; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.W., Bannister, J.L., Abernathy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urbán, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, world-wide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Bethlem, C.B.P., (1998) Estimativas de abundância das baleias jubarte (Megaptera novaeangliae) em sua concentração reprodutiva no Banco dos Abrolhos, Bahia, Brasil, , Unpubl.

Recordings were made from a drifting boat a few kilometres seaward of the observation point, during the peak of at least one of the annual migration phases. This paper presents an analysis of song vocalisation in relation to the observed movements of the whales to determine the vocalisation rates and their value as an index of relative abundance. The proportion of whales singing as they passed Point Lookout was ~ 5% during the northern migration (towards the breeding grounds) and ~ 13% during the southern migration, the difference being statistically significant. There was no significant trend in the proportion of singers as the stock size increased by a factor of 3. From 1982 to 1993, the number of singers passing per 10 hours during the southern migration increased at a rate of 10.6% (95% confidence interval 3% - 19%), consistent with the rate of increase of 11.7% obtained from the visual survey over a similar period.",,"migration; vocalization; whale; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bryden, M.M., Studies of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), area V (1985) Studies of Sea Mammals in South Latitudes, pp. 115-123. , Ling, J.L. & Bryden, M.M.

Crude catch per unit of effort (CPUE) indices were calculated as annual catch per catcher vessel for the Falkland Island Dependencies, African and South American whaling grounds. No CPUE indices could be calculated for the Australian grounds or the Antarctic pelagic whaling grounds. Catch trends in most grounds showed marked declines within the first decade of whaling, followed by no recovery.

Analyses of photo-identification data and acoustic recordings suggest that this population is a component of the Area V stock. To date, 206 humpback whales have been individually identified. Photo-ID comparisons prove migratory movements between New Caledonia and each of eastern Australia, New Zealand and Tonga. The constant increase in re-sightings of individuals from 1996 to 1998 suggests that the population is not large with an estimate of 314 (±72) using a weighted mean of the Petersen estimate. Crude birth rate was calculated at 3.4-10% per year. The most commonly encountered pod types were singles (39%) and pairs (31%). Occurrences were greater in August and July. Reproductive groups (16%) and cow and calf pairs (11%) were most often observed in August. Size structure of the population was dominated by large whales (83%). A maximum lenght of stay of 60 days was observed for a male. A sex-ratio of 1.9:1 in favour of males was calculated.

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA variation suggests that humpback whale populations are subjected to contraction and expansion cycles associated with glaciations. Contrast between nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversities show that expansion phases may be related to regional differentiation dependent upon sex-biased dispersal. To explain trans-oceanic gene flow from sex-biased dispersal, we analysed the species' wintering habits in the Mexican Pacific as described from the sex composition and temporal profile of social groupings. In consideration of the energetic burden for reproduction of female humpback whales and the resultant pre-copulatory competition among males, trans-oceanic gene flow may be explained by changes in winter distribution driven by male dispersal dynamics and gametic exchange across high productivity areas close to the equatorial coast of the American Pacific, as well as by the influence of long-term climatic change in forming trans-equatorial corridors for female interchange. Because of the sensitivity of humpback whale reproduction and dispersal to environment perturbations, our results raise concerns about the effects of climate change on the phylogeographic structure and thereby the evolution and long-term conservation of this species.",,"gene flow; genetic structure; mitochondrial DNA; population genetics; whale; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Acevedo, A., Smultea, M.A., First records of humpback whales including calves at Golfo Dulce and Isla del Coco, Costa Rica, suggesting geographical overlap of northern and southern hemisphere populations (1995) Marine Mammal Science, 11, pp. 554-560; Avise, J.C., Ball, R.M., Arnold, J., Current versus historical population sizes in vertebrate species with high gene flow: A comparison based on mitochondrial DNA lineages and inbreeding theory for neutral mutations (1988) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 5, pp. 331-344; Bak, P., Paczuski, M., Complexity, contingency and criticality (1995) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 92, pp. 6689-6696; Baker, C.S., (1985) The Population Structure and Social Organization of Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Central and Eastern North Pacific, , Unpubl.

While its function remains unclear, the association between song and its production during the breeding season has lead to the hypothesis that song may be an acoustic display used by males to attract potential mates and repel rival males. If so, significant differences in the song between singers might be expected. Here we describe the structure of the song off east Australia in 1998 and present a quantitative comparison of the acoustical characteristics of two sound types between six individual singers to determine the extent that these provided discrimination between individuals. The song was found to consist of five themes produced in a fixed order, consistent with other observations of humpback whale song. Multivariate and univariate tests showed significant measurable differences between individuals for all acoustical parameters included in the analysis. However, for any parameter, the differences were accounted for by one or two individuals and there was no observable pattern or consistent differences between individuals. Canonical analysis showed substantial overlap between clusters suggesting poor discrimination between individuals. The frequency of different units of the same sound type varied by less than two semi-tones for an individual and no more than three semi-tones between individuals, suggesting that humpback whales have a well refined perception of pitch. We conclude that while there were differences between individuals in the characteristics of the two sounds analysed, these did not provide useful discrimination between individuals.",,"intraspecific variation; song; vocalization; whale; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Brown, M.R., Corkeron, P.J., Hale, P.T., Schultz, K.W., Bryden, M.M., Evidence for sex-segregated migration in the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 259 B, pp. 229-234; Bryden, M.M., Studies of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), Area V (1985) Studies of Sea Mammals in Southern Latitudes, pp. 115-123. , Ling, J.L. & Bryden, M.M (eds) (South Australian Museum: Adelaide); Bryden, M.M., Kirkwood, G.P., Slade, R.W., Humpback whales, Area V.

A preliminary study applied molecular techniques to an initial set of 32 biopsied or sloughed skin samples. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to provide an estimate of genetic variability and intra-population structure. Diversity of RAPD banding patterns suggest substantial genetic variability among sampled individuals. A parsimony tree was constructed using presence/absence of RAPD bands as characters, revealing three distinct groups: one of closely related individuals separate from two distinct clades within which relationships were unresolved. Mitochondrial DNA sequences for a consensus fragment 283 base pair in length of the rapidly evolving mitochondrial control region were then generated for the 32 samples and an additional 48 skin samples obtained from further fieldwork. An extensive comparative analysis was made with both published and unpublished control region sequences from humpback whales previously sampled in Colombia (n=64) and other regions in the Southern hemisphere (n=193) and the North Pacific (n=21). Haplotype diversity of the Colombian humpback population was high relative to other sampled populations, with 37 distinctive haplotypes, 11 of which were represented by a single animal. Both RAPD and mtDNA sequence data suggest further genetic substructure within the Colombian Pacific Coast humpback whale population. A large proportion of haplotypes (n=17) are shared with humpback whales sampled off the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting a strong migratory connection between these regions as reported elsewhere.

Of 1410 instances of double tagging, there were 414 resightings. No false positive and 14 false negative errors were identified. The rate of error increased with decreasing photographic quality; no errors were observed among photographs of the highest quality rating, whereas an error rate of 0.125 was identified in sightings for which only part of the area used for identification was visible. There was also a weaker relationship between error rate and the distinctiveness of markings, which may result from non-independence in coding for image quality and distinctiveness. A correction is developed for the Petersen two-sample abundance estimator to account for false negative errors in identification, and a parametric bootstrap procedure for estimation of variance is also developed. In application to abundance estimates from the North Atlantic, the correction reduces the bias in estimates made using poorer quality photographs to a negligible level while maintaining comparable precision.",,"error analysis; identification method; mark-recapture method; whale",,,,,,,"Agler, B.A., Testing the reliability of photographic identification of individual fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1992) Rep.

These were fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), sei whale (B. borealis), minke whale (B. acutorostrata), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus), Sowerby's beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens), killer whale (Orcinus orca), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), white-beaked dolphin (L. albirostris), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Atlantic white-sided dolphin was the most abundant species in the region with a total of 6317 animals recorded. Harbour porpoise was the most frequently sighted cetacean species. The geographical distribution of sightings indicate that cetacean species have varying ecological requirements, with species such as sperm whale, pilot whale and white-sided dolphin favouring deep water off the continental shelf edge, while minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise were apparently limited to the continental shelf. The diversity of species recorded in the region suggests that the Atlantic Frontier is an important habitat for cetaceans. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Atlantic Frontier; Cetaceans; Continental shelf; Distribution; North-east Atlantic; Scotland; Surveys","biological survey; cetacean; geographical distribution; species diversity; species occurrence; Atlantic Ocean; United Kingdom; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Bidens; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon bidens; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,"This work was sponsored by both the Government and members of the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network.

In addition we present a method for testing hypotheses regarding relative reproductive success of different ecologically or behaviorally defined groups as well as a new method for estimating the current population size of males from genotypic data. This method is an extension of the fractional paternity method to the case where only a proportion of all putative fathers have been sampled. It can also be applied to provide abundance estimates of the number of breeding males from genetic data.

Singing humpbacks were consistently detected between October and March from the Shetland-Faroe Islands south to waters west of the English Channel. Temporal and geographic patterns of song detections, and movements of individually tracked whales, exhibited a southwesterly trend over this period, but with no corresponding northward trend between April and September. These results, together with a review of historical data from this area, suggest that the offshore waters of the British Isles represent a migration corridor for humpbacks, at least some of which summer in Norwegian (and possibly eastern Icelandic) waters. The migratory destination of the detected animals remains unknown, but the limited data suggest that these whales are bound primarily for the West Indies rather than historical breeding areas off the northwestern coast of Africa. Humpbacks detected in British waters after early to mid-March probably do not undertake a full migration to the tropics. These data provide further evidence that singing is not confined to tropical waters in winter, but occurs commonly on migration even in high latitudes.","Acoustic monitoring; Britain; Europe; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; North Atlantic; Song; SOSUS","acoustic method; migration; spatiotemporal analysis; vocalization; whale; North Sea; Animalia; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Abileah, R., Martin, D., Lewis, S.D., Gisiner, R., Long-rage acoustic detection and tracking of the Hawaii-Alaska migration (1996) MTS/IEEE Oceans 96, 1, pp. 373-377. , Ft.

We used this positional information and oceanographic data (bathymetry, temperature, and salinity) to predict critical habitat off the coast of British Columbia for sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and blue (Balaenoptera musculus) whales. We used generalized linear models at annual and monthly time scales to relate whale occurrence to six predictor variables (month, depth, slope, depth class, and sea surface temperature and salinity). The models showed critical habitat for sei, fin, and male sperm whales along the continental slope and over a large area off the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Habitat models for blue, humpback, and female sperm whales were relatively insensitive to the predictor variables, owing partially to the smaller sample sizes for these groups. The habitat predictions lend support to recent hypotheses about sperm whale breeding off British Columbia and identify humpback whale habitat in sheltered bays and straits throughout the coast.

We compiled records collected between 1979 and 1995 by eight independent research groups, which yielded 29 cases where 25 different mothers sighted in Hawai'i were identified later the same year in Alaska. In 7 of 29 cases, a calf sighted with its mother in Hawai'i was missing from its mother's Alaska sighting(s). After investigating many factors, we determined that the largest potential bias would occur in late-autumn observations, when calf absences might indicate weaning or temporary mother-calf separation rather than calf mortality. Our minimal and most robust estimate excluded all mortalities and survivals based on sightings of the mother after October 31; 3 of 20 cases or 0.150 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.032, 0.378). The maximal calf mortality rate, derived from all the available data, was 7 of 29 cases or 0.241 (95% CI = 0.103, 0.434). An intermediate estimate that excluded all cases based on single Alaska sightings and omitted late-season sightings (2 of 11 cases or 0.182; 95% CI = 0.023, 0.518) is perhaps closest to the actual first-year mortality rate for humpback whale calves, although it is compromised by its small sample size. Our results demonstrate both the value and the limitations of using longitudinal data to determine the life-history parameters that are essential for documenting the recovery of endangered populations.",,"Marine biology; Research; Humpback whale calves; Biodiversity; estimation method; mortality; whale; (North); Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in Hawaiian waters (1984) Can.

Whales uttered series of cries similar in acoustic structure to those described previously as stereotyped, rhythmic ‘feeding calls’. Individual cries ranged in duration from 0.4 to 8.2 sec. (median = 2.6 sec). Cries typically had a short, strongly frequency modulated (FM) introductory and ending component (labeled Section A and C, respectively). Cries had relatively little FM over the main body of the call (labeled Section B) which ranged in fundamental frequency from 360 to 988 Hz (median = 553 Hz) and sometimes exhibited a frequency oscillation over a bandwidth of approximately 16 to 65 Hz. Principle components analysis indicated that most variation in the data-set (over 35%) could be attributed to measures of absolute frequency, however a substantial amount of variation was also due to other acoustic parameters such as duration, frequency oscillation and average slope of cry sections A and C. Within series, cries were stereotyped and varied little, whereas there was statistically significant variation in cries between series. Furthermore, overlapping cries, which are considered to represent the vocalizations of different individuals, varied significantly. These results suggest that whales may produce individually specific cries, and we propose two alternative hypotheses to account for our observations: 1) cries may carry individual signature information, and 2) simultaneously vocalizing animals may actively mismatch cries to maximize a herding effect on prey. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Feeding vocalization; Foraging; Humpback whale; Individual variation; Multivariate","feeding behavior; individual variation; vocalization; whale; Pacific Ocean; United States; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., (1985) The Population Structure and Social Organization of Humpback Whales (Megaptera Novaeangliae) in the Central and Eastern North Pacific, , Ph.D. thesis, University of Hawaii, Honolulu; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Mar.

We searched historical records and computerized stranding databases for evidence of ship strikes involving great whales (i.e., baleen whales and the sperm whale). Historical records suggest that ship strikes fatal to whales first occurred late in the 1800s as ships began to reach speeds of 13-15 kn, remained infrequent until about 1950, and then increased during the 1950s-1970s as the number and speed of ships increased. Of 11 species known to be hit by ships, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are struck most frequently; right whales (Eubalaena glacialis and E. australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whales (Physeter catodon), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are hit commonly. In some areas, one-third of all fin whale and right whale strandings appear to involve ship strikes. To assess contributing factors, we compiled descriptions of 58 collisions. They indicate that all sizes and types of vessels can hit whales; most lethal or severe injuries are caused by ships 80 m or longer; whales usually are not seen beforehand or are seen too late to be avoided; and most lethal or severe injuries involve ships travelling 14 kn or faster. Ship strikes can significantly affect small populations of whales, such as northern right whales in the western North Atlantic. In areas where special caution is needed to avoid such events, measures to reduce the vessel speed below 14 kn may be beneficial.","Mortality; Right whales; Ship collisions; Species conservation; Strandings","collision; mortality; shipping; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon",,,,,,,"Alexander, G., (1980) Blue whale apparently killed by Ship, (PART II), p. 8. , Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, CA. 8 July; Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Boston Society of Natural History.

For this purpose, surveys were carried out onboard whale-watching boats at two different sites: Puerto López and Puerto Cayo. Some population parameters such as distribution, group structure, population size, calving rate and behavior were evaluated. The first whales arrived by the end of May, they peaked in July and most of them had left the area by the end of September. Along the Puerto López route, groups were significantly larger (P<0.01) but whales were significantly less abundant (P<0.01) than Puerto Cayo's. GPS-positioned sightings showed that whales presented a clumped distribution with concentrations at specific sites along both surveyed routes. Analyses of group composition suggest a type of age/sex-class segregation inside the study area. Around sites such as La Plata Island and the Bajo de Cantagallo groups were composed mainly of adult and subadult animals. In contrast, nearby Puerto Cayo groups were composed mainly of mothers with calves and solitary individuals. Groups changed at least one member every 257 minutes on the average, but no change in membership was noticed when a mother-calf pair was present. Most calves recorded from the second half of August onward and showed a preference for shallow waters with 20m or less in depth. The crude birth rate average obtained (0.039) is considered underestimated. A low resighting rate of photo-identified individuals indicates both a low residence level and a poor degree of fidelity to the study site. The size of the stock was estimated in 1996 to be 1,922 whales (95% C.I. 77-3,367).","Ecuador; Humpback whale; Population parameters; South America; Southeastern Pacific stock","behavioral ecology; population structure; reproduction; whale; Ecuador; Pacific Ocean; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Aguayo, A., Baleen whales off continental Chile (1974) The Whale Problem, a Status Report, pp. 209-217. , W.

It has been hypothesized that whales maintain continuity through cultural transmission via migratory movements of males. We examined songs of whales breeding off Hawaii and Mexico to determine whether they changed similarly in both areas during the course of a breeding season. Songs recorded off Kauai, Hawaii (11 individuals) and Isla Socorro, Mexico (13 individuals) during winter and spring of 1991, were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. We measured 44 acoustic variables describing all known levels of song structure for each singer and we grouped these variables into six categories. We used two-factor analyses of variance to assess change across the season in each area, comparing the two regions and two 3-week periods (January/February and April). Twenty-seven variables changed significantly during the 12-week study in at least one area. Variables within categories displayed similar trends of change. Time and frequency characteristics describing the structure of song elements (units and phrases) changed synchronously in each area, with 21 of 25 variables displaying significant differences between periods and no interaction with region. Structures of song patterns, as defined by frequency of occurrence and number of unit and phrase types, changed differently in each area, with five of 12 variables indicating a significant interaction between region and period. Our results may suggest cultural transmission during the season, since many variables changed in similar manners. We propose an alternative hypothesis, that whales may be predisposed to gradually change certain features of song independently of cultural influences; change of structural elements may be governed by a discrete set of rules, or according to an innate template. Therefore, continuity of song patterns across the ocean basin may be due to a combination of mechanisms, only partially involving cultural transmission. We assess these hypotheses in relation to humpback whale behaviour and population structure, and cultural transmission and evolution of avian song. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,"song; spatial variation; temporal variation; whale; (North); Pacific Ocean; Aves; Cetacea; Galliformes; Hawaiia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,"Animal Behavior Society, ABS

To evaluate these, from 24 January-13 April 1997 off Maui, Hawaii, 42 singers were located, audio-recorded, photo-identified and monitored for interactions with other whales. Whales that joined singers were biopsy sampled for molecular determination of sex. In 76% (32 of 42) of the interactions, a lone non-singing adult joined the singer. In the remainder, singers stopped singing and joined a nearby group or accompanied other whales. In 81% (26 of 32) instances where a lone adult joined a singer, the pair split again within minutes; otherwise a group formed. In one such group the pair became a trio and eventually joined a competitive group. Behavior in joining/splitting interactions ranged from a single pass-by, to surface activity such as tail lobs and breaches. The sex of 22 joiners was determined: 14 genetically and eight behaviorally. All were males. Humpback whale song preceded, and at times followed, male-male interactions of variable duration and agonistic level in and around the breeding season. If considered within the context of a proposed dominance polygyny mating system, these observations appear to support speculation that the song may function in male social ordering.","Communication; Dominance polygyny; Humpback whale; Mating behavior; Megaptera novaeangliae; Secondary sexual display; Song","dominance; intrasexual interaction; male behavior; social behavior; song; Hawaiian Islands; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Amos, W.A., Hoelzel, A.R., Long-term preservation of whale skin for DNA analysis (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

We report on a comprehensive analysis of interchange in the North Pacific among three wintering regions (Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan) each with two to three subareas, and feeding areas that extended from southern California to the Aleutian Islands. Of the 6,413 identification photographs of humpback whales obtained by 16 independent research groups between 1990 and 1993 and examined for this study, 3,650 photographs were determined to be of suitable quality. A total of 1,241 matches was found by two independent matching teams, identifying 2,712 unique whales in the sample (seen one to five times). Site fidelity was greatest at feeding areas where there was a high rate of resightings in the same area in different years and a low rate of interchange among different areas. Migrations between winter regions and feeding areas did not follow a simple pattern, although highest march rates were found for whales that moved between Hawaii and southeastern Alaska, and between mainland and Baja Mexico and California. Interchange among subareas of the three primary wintering regions was extensive for Hawaii, variable (depending on subareas) for Mexico, and low for Japan and reflected the relative distances among subareas. Interchange among these primary wintering regions was rare. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin.","Humpback whale; Interchange; Megaptera novaeangliae; Migration; Movements; North Pacific; Photo-identification; Population structure","identification method; migration; photography; population structure; whale; (North); Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Allen, J.M., Rosenbaum, H.C., Katona, S.K., Clapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Regional and sexual differences in fluke pigmentation of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from the North Atlantic Ocean (1994) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 72, pp. 274-279; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Migration and local movement of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) through Hawaiian waters (1981) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 59, pp. 460-469; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Straley, J.H., Population characteristics and migration of summer and late-season humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in southeastern Alaska (1985) Marine Mammal Science, 1, pp. 304-323; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Östman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertson, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature (London), 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Gilbert, D.A., Weinrich, M.T., Lambertsen, R., Calambokidis, J., McArdle, B., Chambers, G.K., O'Brien, S.J., Population characteristics of DNA fingerprints in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1993) Journal of Heredity, 84, pp. 281-290; Baker, C.S., Slade, R.B., Bannister, J.L., Abernethy, R.B., Weinrich, M.T., Lien, J., Urbán-R, J., Palumbi, S.R., Hierarchical structure of mitochondrial DNA gene flow among humpback whales, world-wide (1994) Molecular Ecology, 3, pp. 313-327; Baker, C.S., Medrano-Gonzalez, L., Calambokidis, J., Perry, A., Pichler, F., Rosenbaum, H., Straley, J.M., Von Ziegesar, O., Population structure of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation among humpback whales in the North Pacific (1998) Molecular Ecology, 7, pp. 695-708; Barlow, J., Recent information on the status of large whales in California waters (1994) NOAA Technical Memorandum NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-203, , National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22167. 27 pp; Barlow, J., Forney, K.A., Hill, P.S., Brownell R.L., Jr., Carretta, J.V., DeMaster, D.P., Julian, F., Reeves, R.R., U.S. pacific marine mammal stock assessments: 1996 (1997) NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-248, , National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22167. 223 pp; Berzin, A.A., Rovnin, A.A., The distribution and migrations of whales in the northeastern part of the Pacific, Chuckchee and Bering Seas (1966) Soviet research on marine mammals in the Far East, pp. 179-207. , K.

Under favorable ice conditions, these whales repeatedly appeared at the shelf off Chukotka, even in late May. In the summer, in the coastal zone, humpback whales were only rarely seen, individually or in pairs. In the fall, humpback whales formed aggregations in the most southern part of the Chukchi Sea, in the Senyavin Strait, and in the northern part of the Gulf of Anadyr. The whales left the area of the survey prior to the start of ice formation. Both in the past and at present, these waters are the summer feeding grounds of humpback whales.

Respiratory and movement behaviors of humpback whales off North Kauai, hawaii, were examined for potential changes in response to these transmissions and to vessels. Few vessel effects were observed, but there were fewer vessels operating during this study than in previous years. No overt responses to ATOC were observed for received levels of 98-109 dB re 1 μPa. An analysis of covariance, using the no-sound behavioral rate as a covariate to control for interpod variation, found that the distance and time between successive surfacings of humpbacks increased slightly with an increase in estimated received ATOC sound level. These responses are very similar to those observed in response to scaled-amplitude playbacks of ATOC signals [Frankel and Clark, Can. J. Zool. 76, 521-535 (1998)]. These similar results were obtained with different sound projectors, in different years and locations, and at different ranges creating a different sound field. The repeatability of the findings for these two different studies indicates that these effects, while small, are robust. This suggests that at least for the ATOC signal, the received sound level is a good predictor of response.

Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted species in terms of number of schools and number of individuals (82 sightings:159 animals). All humpback sightings were west of 120 °E; distributed over a wide latitudinal band from the ice edge out to the northern limit of the survey (63 °S); correlated with high integrated-Chl a (&gt; 50 μm/m2); and generally concentrated in the waters to the south of the Antarctic Divergence and the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Baleen whale distribution reflected the overall patterns of biological productivity and oceanographic processes. Most animals were found to the west of 120 °E and to the south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (which lies well offshore in this region) and the Antarctic Divergence, which coincided with the ACC between 85 and 135 °E on this survey. The large-scale patterns observed in this survey indicate that baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean may be concentrated in areas where extensive winter sea-ice cover and oceanographic features allow extended residence time in surface waters for primary producers during the Austral summer ice retreat. Odontocete species were less abundant and generally concentrated at meso-scale high-productivity areas produced by the interactions of identifiable physical features.

Berths and funding were provided by ANARE, and funds were also provided by the then Australian Nature Conservation Agency and W.V. Scott Estate. The positive attitude between scientists from a wide range of disciplines, both on the survey and since, has made sharing of data and ideas and the objective of multidisciplinary analysis an enjoyable reality.

Identification photographs of individual whales, including 63 females sighted in at least 2 different years and with at least 1 calf, were collected from waters off the islands of Maui and Hawaii ('Big Island') between 1977 and 1994. Calves formed a significantly larger proportion of the population off Maui than off the Big Island. The overall proportion of calves to all whales identified (crude birth rate) was 0.099 off Maui and 0.061 off the Big Island. Also, considering only females seen in more than 1 year, the number of calves per female per year (calving rate) was 0.71 off Maui and 0.52 off the Big Island. These rates may be inflated somewhat because of the greater likelihood of sighting and identifying females with calf than females without. Females sighted at both Maui and the Big Island in different years were with a calf significantly more often in Maui waters than in Big Island waters. It was concluded that habitat utilisation by females varies between Maui and the Big Island, and appears to depend in part upon reproductive status.","Calving; Habitat; Humpback whale; Reproduction","habitat selection;

Box 159, Gloucester, MA 01930, United States","Photographs of 99 humpback whales of known age were analyzed to assess the temporal variability and recognizability of individually distinctive fluke and dorsal fin features used for photo-identification. Stable features tended to be morphological in nature (dorsal fin shape and edges, the trailing edge of the fluke, and the raised bumps on the caudal peduncle termed 'knobs'). Transitory features typically were superficial marks (scarring, scratching, and pigmentation). The variability of several features was found to be age-dependent as well. Young animals sometimes experienced substantial change to their fluke coloration patterns, though this feature stabilized with age. Dorsal fin edges and fluke serration peaks tended to undergo more change in males than in females, with most changes occurring following sexual maturation. Peduncle knobs were the most stable feature, with no documented change in any age interval given the extreme stability (and hence recognizability) of dorsal fin shape and peduncle knobs, we suggest that photographs combining the dorsal fin and the caudal peduncle provide the most consistent way to reidentify humpback whales, particularly calves following weaning.","Flukes; Humpback whale; Matching; Megaptera novaeangliae; Peduncle knobs; Photo-identification","Animalia; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,"Agler, B.A., Beard, J.A., Bowman, R.S., Corbett, H.D., Frohock, S.E., Hawvermale, M.P., Katona, S.E., Seipt, I.E., Finback whale, Balaenoptera physalus, photographic identification: Methodology and preliminary results from the Western North Atlantic (1990) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

Criteria for evaluating photographic quality and individual distinctiveness were developed involving judgments about overall quality or distinctiveness and about specific aspects of each. These criteria were tested for the level of agreement among judges. The distinctiveness scheme was tested for the independence of distinctiveness judgments and photographic quality. Our results show that judges could agree when evaluating specific and overall aspects of photographic quality and individual distinctiveness. The level of agreement varied for different pairs of judges, and less adept judges were identified. Ability to agree on evaluations of photographic quality was independent of the experience of the judges. Overall photographic quality and overall distinctiveness were successfully predicted from more specific variables, but the agreement between judges for these was not significantly greater than the agreement for the overall measures judged directly. There was no correlation between individual distinctiveness and photographic quality for four of the five judges, but the power of this test may be low. Analyses of photographic identification data frequently require evaluations of photographic quality and individual distinctiveness.

The catch data were analyzed using annual and monthly mean values. Monthly and annual variation in whaling effort was deduced from accounts of the history of British Columbia coastal whaling, and biases arising from changes in effort were considered in the interpretation of the results. During the later years of whaling (1948-1967), the mean lengths of captured whales declined significantly and pregnancy rates dropped to near zero in fin, sei, and blue whales. Monthly patterns in numbers killed revealed a summer migration of sei and blue whales past Vancouver Island, and confirms anecdotal suggestions that local populations of fin and humpback whales once spent extended periods in the coastal waters of British Columbia. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that sperm whales mated (April-May) and calved (July-August) in British Columbia's offshore waters. The historic whaling records reveal much about the migratory behavior and distribution of the large whales species as they once were, and may continue to be, in the northeastern Pacific. Verifying the persistence of these trends in the remnant populations is a necessary and logical next step.","Blue whale; British Columbia; Fin whale; Humpback whale; Migration; North Pacific; Population structure; Sei whale; Sperm whale; Whaling","fishery survey; long-term change; migration; population structure; whale; (Northeast); British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter macrocephalus",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Perry, A., Lawton, W.S., Straley, J.M., Wolman, A.A., Kaufman, G.D., Ostman, J., Migratory movement and population structure of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the central and eastern North Pacific (1986) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 31, pp. 105-119; Best, P.B., (1979) Social Organization in Sperm Whales, pp. 227-289. , H.

A clear difference in densities against the physiographic variables (the sea floor-slope type) was identified between baleen whales and toothed whales. Densities of sperm whales and ziphiids were low in the waters over the continental shelf where minke whales' densities were highest. This led to an apparent negative correlation in the density between minke and sperm whales, and minke whale and ziphiids. A significant positive correlation in density between minke and blue whales was identified. No association in density between minke and humpback whales was observed. Distribution of killer whales shows strong positive correlation with that of minke whales. The positive correlation existed between minke and blue whales, and minke and killer whales even when the effect of environmental variables was excluded.

Annual reproductive rates were measured by two methods: proportion of all whales that were calves based on sightings (0.6%-5.9% per year, mean = 3.6%, SD = 1.6) and based on individually identified animals (1.1%-8.0% per year, mean = 4.1%, SD = 1.8). The reproductive rate based on sightings varied significantly by year (G test, P < 0.001), region (G test, P < 0.001), and by month (G test, P < 0.05). Seventy-nine sexually mature females were identified with 97 calves out of a total of 844 known individuals over the 11-yr study. Mother-calf separation on the feeding grounds was recorded in several instances. The apparent reproductive rates of this population are considerably lower than rates of 4%-15% reported from other feeding areas for this species. Our estimates are likely biased downward because this population has been increasing at about 5% per year. Calves may have been missed due to early weaning and because of our sampling from small boats late in the season. We also found evidence of geographic segregation of mother-calf pairs within our large study area. Despite these factors, we conclude the reproductive rate of this population appears to be lower than has been reported in other areas.","California; Humpback whales; Megaptera novaeangliae; North Pacific; Photographic identification; Reproductive rates","reproduction biology; United States; reproduction; whale; California; United States; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Addison, R.F., Organochlorines and marine mammal reproduction (1989) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 46, pp. 360-368; Baker, C.S., Perry, A., Herman, L.M., Reproductive histories of female humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the North Pacific (1987) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 41, pp. 103-114; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Lambertson, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., O'Brien, S.J., Influence of seasonal migration on geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humpback whales (1990) Nature (London), 344, pp. 238-240; Baker, C.S., Straley, J.M., Perry, A., Population characteristics of individually identified humpback whales in Southeastern Alaska: Summer and fall 1986 (1992) Fishery Bulletin, 90, pp. 429-437. , U.S; Baraff, L., Weinrich, M.T., Separation of humpback whale mothers and calves on the feeding ground in early autumn (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 431-434; Barlow, J., Abundance of large whales in California coastal waters: A comparison of ship surveys in 1979/80 and in 1991 (1994) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 44, pp. 399-406; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

The data logger sampled the sounds for four minutes every half hour using a digitizing rate of 2 kHz, and the data were stored on a hard disk. The results between January and April showed a peak in the sound pressure level between mid-February and mid-March. This peak of approximately 120 dB re 1 μPa coincided with the peak in the number of whales sighted by aerial survey on 7 March 1998. The choruses had spectral peaks at 315 Hz and 630 Hz. Some of the sounds at 630 Hz were second harmonics of the 315 Hz peak and others were not. The data also indicated a diurnal pattern in the sound pressure level, with levels at night significantly louder than the daytime levels. The sound levels began to increase during sunset and remained relatively high until sunrise, when they progressively decreased to a minimum. The nighttime peak occurred within an hour before and after midnight, and the daytime minimum occurred between 1100 and 1500. That more humpback whales appear to sing at night may reflect a switch to sexual advertisement as the primary male mating strategy at this time. It may also indicate that daylight and vision play key roles in the formation of competitive groups. It is suggested that the relative number of humpback whales in a given locale may be estimated by monitoring changes in sound pressure levels.","Ambient noise; Chorusing sounds; Data logger; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae","diurnal variation; seasonal variation; vocalization; whale; Hawaiian Islands; Maui; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Green, M., Acoustic interaction of humpback whales and whale watching boats (2000) Marine Environmental Research, , In press; Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Aggressive behavior between humpback whales (Megaptera novaeanglaie) wintering in hawaiian waters (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1922-1937; Brigham, E.O., (1988) The Fast Fourier Transform and Its Application, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Burgess, W.C., Tyack, P.L., Le Booeuf, B.J., Costa, D.P., A programmable acoustic recording tag and first results from free-ranging northern elephant seals (1998) Deep-Sea Research II, 45, pp. 1327-1351; Chapham, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Humpback whale songs as indicators of migration routes (1990) Marine Mammal Science, 6, pp. 155-160; Clapham, P.J., PalsbØll, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Vasquez, O., Composition and dynamics of humpback whale competitive groups in the west Indies (1992) Behaviour, 122, pp. 182-194; Clark, C.W., Fristrup, K.M., Whales '95: A combined visual and acoustic survey of blue and fin whales off southern California (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 583-600; Frankel, A.S., Acoustic and visual tracking reveals distribution, song variability and social roles of humpback whales in Hawaiian waters (1994) Doctoral Dissertation, University of Hawaii, , Manoa. 142 pp; Frankel, A.S., Clark, C.W., Herman, L.M., Gabriele, C.M., Spatial distribution, habitat utilization, and social interactions of humpback whales, megaptera novaeangliae, off Hawaii, determined using acoustic and visual techniques (1995) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 73, pp. 1134-1146; Fristrup, K.M., Clark, C.W., Combining visual and acoustic survey data to enhance density estimation (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 933-936; Goold, J.C., A diel pattern in vocal activity of short-beaked common dolphins, Delphinus delphis (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 240-244; Guinee, L.N., Chu, K., Dorsey, E.M., Changes over time in the songs of known individual humpback whales (Megaptera novaeanglaie) (1983) Communication and Behavior of Whales, pp. 59-80. , R.

Seventeen species were represented: Blue Whale (1 single stranding), Fin Whale (1 single stranding), Minke Whale (3 single strandings), Humpback Whale (4 single strandings), Sperm Whale (8 strandings, 13 animals), Pygmy Sperm Whale (3 strandings, 4 animals), Dwarf Sperm Whale (2 single strandings), Northern Bottlenose Whale (3 single strandings), Sowerby's Beaked Whale (1 single stranding), Killer Whale (1 single stranding), Long-finned Pilot Whale (37 strandings, 173+ animals), White-beaked Dolphin (1 stranding, 2 animals), Atlantic White-sided Dolphin (9 strandings, 13 animals), Risso's Dolphin (1 single stranding), Striped Dolphin (8 strandings, 22 animals), Short-beaked Common Dolphin (4 strandings, 6 animals), Harbour Porpoise (11 strandings, 13 animals). The records of the Dwarf Sperm Whale and that of the Risso's Dolphin are the first for eastern Canada. The record of the Sowerby's Beaked Whale is the first reported stranding in Nova Scotia. Humpback, Minke, and Killer whales, and Short-beaked Common Dolphins have not previously been recorded stranded on Sable Island. The majority of stranding events (84) were of a single animal; nine involved two animals; eight involved 3-10 animals; and one event involved over 130 animals. Recorded strandings increased from 1.9 strandings/year between 1970-1989 to 7.1 strandings/year between 1990-1998. Mass strandings of multiple male Sperm Whales have occurred three times (all since 1990). All Atlantic White-sided Dolphin strandings investigated were also comprised of male animals.","Cetacean; Nova Scotia; Sable Island; Stranding","animal behavior; canada; Cetacea; dolphin; humpback whale; sperm whale; whale; cetacean; stranding; Canada; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Mammalia; Martes zibellina; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella coeruleoalba; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., True's beaked whale in Nova Scotia (1939) Journal of Mammalogy, 20, pp. 259-260; Ailing, A.K., Whitehead, H.P., A preliminary study of the status of White-beaked Dolphins, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and other small cetaceans off the coast of Labrador (1987) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 101, pp. 131-135; Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Status of Risso's Dolphin, Grampus griseus, in Canada (1991) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 105, pp. 233-242; Baird, R.W., Stacey, P.J., Whitehead, H., Status of the Striped Dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, in Canada (1993) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 107, pp. 455-465; Baird, R.W., Walters, E.L., Stacey, P.J., Status of the Bottlenose Dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, with special reference to Canada (1993) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 107, pp. 466-480; Baird, R.W., Nelson, D., Lien, J., Nagorsen, D.W., The status of the Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia breviceps, in Canada (1996) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 110, pp. 525-532; Bloch, D., Desportes, G., Petersen, A., Sigurjónsson, J., Strandings of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and sightings in the Northeast Atlantic, north of 50 N latitude (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 125-132; Bossart, G.D., Walsh, M.T., Odell, D.K., Lynch, J.D., Beusse, D.O., Friday, R., Young, W.G., Histopathologic findings in a mass stranding of pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) (1991) Marine Mammal Strandings in the United States, pp. 85-90. , Proceedings of the 2nd marine mammal stranding workshop, Miami, Florida.
