Although human-caused mortality is the primary factor contributing to poor recovery of E. glacialis, variability in reproductive success may also play a role. The present study evaluates the idea that seasonal distributions and reproductive success in E. glacialis are linked to food availability or related environmental conditions that can be assessed by treating satellite-derived sea-surface chlorophyll (chl) concentration as a proxy. Sea-surface chl time series in the major high-use feeding habitats and whale-sightings data were compared. Whale transition between habitats reflects a pattern in the seasonal distribution of peak concentration in satellite-derived chl. A regionally and seasonally weighted chl index was calculated to reflect aspects of average potential food condition. We found a significant correlation between the number of whale calves born and the weighted chl averaged over the prior 2 yr. These findings are consistent with the view that food availability during and just before the gestation period may be a critical factor regulating reproductive success, with low food years contributing to delays in conception. Longer time series are necessary to examine the predictive relationship between weighted chl concentration and calf production. Although ecological interactions and whale reproductive biology are certainly more complex than can be encompassed by emphasizing only food availability, analysis of satellite-derived surface chl concentrations provides a practical means to monitor a level of ecosystem variability that affects right-whale distributions and productivity. © Inter-Research 2009.","Calving; Chlorophyll; Eubalaena glacialis; Ocean color; Remote sensing; Right whale; Seasonal patterns; SeaWiFS","anthropogenic effect; chlorophyll; endangered species; environmental conditions; feeding ground; food availability; mortality; ocean color; population distribution; pregnancy; remote sensing; reproductive success; SeaWiFS; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Mem Boston Soc Nat Hist, 8, pp. 107-322; Angell, C.M., (2005) Body Fat Condition of Free-ranging Right Whales, Eubalaena Glacialis and Eubalaena Australis, , PhD dissertation, Boston University; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Tvn, C., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Mayo, C.A., Kenney, R.D., Enormous carnivores, microscopic food, and a restaurant that's hard to find (2007) The Urban Whale: North Atlantic Right Whales at the Crossroads, pp. 138-171. , In: Kraus SD, Rolland R (eds), Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C., Wishner, K.F., MacAulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Campbell, J.W., The lognormal distribution as a model for bio-optical variability in the sea (1995) J Geophys Res, 100, pp. 13237-13254; Campbell, R.G., Runge, J.A., Durbin, E.G., Evidence for food limitation of Calanus finmarchicus production rates on the southern flank of Georges Bank during April 1997 (2001) Deep-Sea Res II, 48, pp. 531-549; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; (1982) A Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid-and North Atlantic Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, , CETAP (Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program), Report no.

Of the factors hypothesized as contributing to the observed reproductive dysfunction in right whales, exposure to marine biotoxins such as domoic acid (DA) has received comparatively little consideration. The present study assessed the occurrence of DA in right whale feces, copepods, and krill collected from April through September of 2005 and 2006 on the whales' feeding grounds along the northeastern USA and eastern Canada. DA was detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in 69 right whale fecal samples, 6 krill samples, and 32 copepod samples. Many of the latter were dominated largely by Stage V Calanus finmarchicus copepodites. DA detection by SPR in fecal and zooplankton collections was verified by receptor binding assay and confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Moreover, LC-MS/MS determined the presence of a putative methylated DA metabolite in all fecal and zooplankton samples analyzed. Frustules of several potentially toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were identified in whale feces and phytoplankton samples by light and electron microscopy. Electron microscopy also revealed an abundance of C. finmarchicus mandibles in right whale feces. These findings confirm that E. glacialis was exposed to DA for several months, likely through ingestion of a DA-contaminated copepod vector. The extent to which this algal biotoxin may contribute to the failed recovery of the E. glacialis population warrants further investigation. © Inter-Research 2010 · www.int-res.com.","Biotoxin trophic transfer; Calanus finmarchicus; Copepod; Domoic acid; Eubalaena glacialis; Harmful algal blooms; Pseudo-nitzschia; Right whale","algal bloom; amino acid; crustacean; endangered species; feeding ground; fishing gear; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; pollution exposure; reproductive health; toxin; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; United States; algae; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Decapoda (Crustacea); Eubalaena glacialis; Euphausiacea; Pseudo-nitzschia",,,,,,,,"Bargu, S., Silver, M.W., Field evidence of krill grazing on the toxic diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia in Monterey Bay, California (2003) Bull Mar.

Low-frequency ocean noise has increased in recent decades, often in habitats with seasonally resident populations of marine mammals, raising concerns that noise chronically influences life histories of individuals and populations. In contrast to physical harm from intense anthropogenic sources, which can have acute impacts on individuals, masking from chronic noise sources has been difficult to quantify at individual or population levels, and resulting effects have been even more difficult to assess. This paper presents an analytical paradigm to quantify changes in an animal's acoustic communication space as a result of spatial, spectral, and temporal changes in background noise, providing a functional definition of communication masking for free-ranging animals and a metric to quantify the potential for communication masking. We use the sonar equation, a combination of modeling and analytical techniques, and measurements from empirical data to calculate time-varying spatial maps of potential communication space for singing fin (Balaenoptera physalus), singing humpback (Megoptera novaeangliae), and calling right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales. These illustrate how the measured loss of communication space as a result of differing levels of noise is converted into a time-varying measure of communication masking. The proposed paradigm and mechanisms for measuring levels of communication masking can be applied to different species, contexts, acoustic habitats and ocean noise scenes to estimate the potential impacts of masking at the individual and population levels. © Inter-Research 2009.","Acoustic habitat; Ambient noise; Baleen whales; Communication masking; Communication space; Cumulative effects; Marine mammals; Spatio-temporal variability; Spectral variability","ambient noise; bioacoustics; communication behavior; ecological impact; human activity; life history; marine ecosystem; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Andrew, R.K., Howe, B.M., Mercer, J.A., Dzieciuch, M.A., Ocean ambient sound: Comparing the 1960's with the 1990s for a receiver off the California coast (2002) ARLO, 3, pp. 65-70; Arons, B., A review of the cocktail party effect (1992) J Am Voice I/O Soc, 12, pp. 35-50; Au, W.W.L., (1993) The Sonar of Dolphins, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Beranek, L.L., Ver, I.L., (1992) Noise and Vibration Control Engineering, , Wiley, New York; Bregman, A.S., (1990) Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Brenowitz, E.A., The active space of red-winged blackbird song (1982) J Comp Physiol [A], 147, pp. 511-522; Broadbent, D.E., (1958) Perception and Communication, , Pergamon, New York; Brown, C.H., The active space of blue monkey and greycheeked mangabey vocalizations (1989) Anim Behav, 37, pp. 1023-1034; Brungart, D.S., Informational and energetic masking effects in multitalker speech perception (2004) Speech Separation by Humans and Machines, pp. 261-267. , Divenji P (ed) Kluwer Academic Press, Boston, MA; Cherry, E.C., Taylor, W.K., Some further experiments upon the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears (1954) J Acoust Soc Am, 26, pp. 554-559; Clark, C.W., Acoustic communication and behavior of the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) (1983) Communication and Behavior of Whales, pp. 163-198. , Payne R (ed) Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Clark, C.W., Call tracks of bowhead whales based on call characteristics as an independent means of determining tracking parameters (1989) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 39, pp. 111-112; Clark, C.W., Acoustic behavior of mysticete whales (1990) Sensory Abilities of Cetaceans, pp. 580-583. , Thomas J, Kastelein R (eds) Plenum Press, New York; Clark, C.W., Ellison, W.T., Potential use of low-frequency sounds by baleen whales for probing the environment: Evidence from models and empirical measurements (2004) Advances in the Study of Echolocation in Bats and Dolphins, pp. 564-589. , Thomas JA, Moss CF, Vater M (eds) University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; Clark, C.W., Gagnon, G.C., Insights from IUSS detections, locations and tracking from 1992 to 1996.

In addressing these issues, we first demonstrate a 3-to 4-fold increase in the number of reported large whale-vessel strikes worldwide from the early 1970s to the early 2000s, corresponding to a 3-fold increase in the number of vessels in the world fleet that is paralleled by an increase in vessel tonnage and speed. Second, we estimate a 50% chance of 14 or more annual vessel-strike reports worldwide between 1999 and 2002. For North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, we estimate a 60% chance of observing at least 1 right whale death from vessel strike. Adjusting for undetermined causes of death and unobserved deaths, we estimate a 10-fold increase (from 1 to 10) in the expected annual number of fatal ship strikes. Third, we evaluate the eastern United States geographic distribution of right whales and vessels to calculate relative probabilities of vessel-whale encounters among 3 major right whale habitats. We determine that the Southern Calving Ground poses the greatest threat of a vessel strike: 1.6-and 7-fold greater than in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel, respectively. Finally, for the Great South Channel region we present a quantitatively determined vessel-traffic routing option that would achieve a 39% reduction in vessel-whale encounter probabilities. The methods employed in assessing encounter probabilities and vessel-routing options can be applied elsewhere to enhance the conservation of endangered and threatened species that suffer vessel-strike mortality. © Inter-Research 2010.","Encounter; Eubalaena glacialis; Mitigation; Mortality; Right whale; Routing; Ship; Strike; Vessel","conservation management; ecological impact; endangered species; estimation method; mitigation; mortality; population distribution; probability; vessel traffic management system; whale; Cape Cod Bay; Great South Channel; Massachusetts; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"(2007) Resolution 3.14: Ship strikes on large whales in the Mediterranean Sea, , ACCOBAMS (Agreement on the conservation of cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area) ACCOBAMS, Monaco; Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep Int Whal Comm Spec Iss, 10, pp. 191-199; Best, P.B., Peddemors, V.M., Cockcroft, V.G., Rice, N., Mortalities of right whales and related anthropogenic factors in South Africa waters (2001) 1963-1998.

Various conservation policies have been implemented to reduce vessel-strike mortality in this species. The International Maritime Organization adopted the Roseway Basin Area to be avoided on the Scotian Shelf as a voluntary conservation initiative to reduce the risk of lethal vessel strikes to right whales. We initiated the Vessel Avoidance & Conservation Area Transit Experiment to evaluate the efficacy of this initiative because the effectiveness of the avoidance scheme in reducing risk without the imposition of vessel-speed restrictions depends entirely on vessel-operator compliance. Using a network of automatic identification system receivers, we collected static, dynamic, and voyage-related vessel data in near real time from the Roseway Basin region for 12 months before and 6 months after the implementation of the area to be avoided. Using pre- and post-implementation vessel navigation and speed data, along with right whale sightings per unit effort data, all resolved at 3′N latitude by 3′W longitude, we estimated the post-implementation change in risk of lethal vessel strikes. Estimates of vessel-operator voluntary compliance ranged from 57% to 87% and stabilized at 71% within the first 5 months of implementation. Our estimates showed an 82% reduction in the risk of lethal vessel strikes to right whales due to vessel-operator compliance. We conclude that the high level of compliance achieved with this voluntary conservation initiative occurred because the area to be avoided was adopted by the International Maritime Organization. Our results demonstrate that international shipping interests are able and willing to voluntarily alter course to protect endangered whales. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Endangered whales; Marine area closure; Roseway Basin; Ship strikes; Vessels; Voluntary compliance; Voluntary conservation practices","conservation planning; endangered species; mortality; policy implementation; risk assessment; vessel; voluntary approach; whale; animal; article; endangered species; environmental protection; ship; whale; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Ships; Whales; Atlantic Ocean; Roseway Basin; Scotia Shelf; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, pp. 435-438. , Pages. in.

There has been disagreement on two questions of balaenid systematics and nomenclature-concerning the number of extant species of right whales and whether or not bowhead whales and right whales are congeneric. They have an extremely robust body form, bordering on rotund, with thick blubber layer and the girth at times exceeding 60% of total body length. The body is mostly black, sometimes with irregular white ventral patches. Right whales are found in the middle latitudes of both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres. There are three geographically isolated populations currently recognized as separate species: in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern oceans. Right whales feed entirely on zooplankton, especially on large calanoid copepods. At times they also feed on smaller copepods, krill (larger shrimp-like crustaceans), pteropods (tiny planktonic snails), or the planktonic larval stages of barnacles and other crustaceans. They migrate annually between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude calving and breeding grounds. Calving in right whales occurs during winter. Where the calving grounds are known, they are in shallow coastal regions or bays. The only known current calving ground in the western North Atlantic is in coastal waters near Georgia and northeastern Florida. Right whales are observed to frequently perform highly energetic behaviors at or above the surface of the water. These aerial behaviors include breaching, lobtailing, and flippering. North Atlantic right whales were the first whales to be harvested commercially by the Basques along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe as early as the eleventh century. The whales were killed primarily for oil, which was sold across Europe, as the technology of the time did not permit preservation and widespread transportation of meat. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals are differentiated on the basis of age or, in general, life cycle stages. The movement of an individual through its life cycle is a random process, and although the eventual destination (death) is certain, the pathways taken to that destination are stochastic and will differ even between identical individuals; this is individual stochasticity. A stage-classified demographic model contains implicit age-specific information, which can be analyzed using Markov chain methods. The living stages in the life cycles are transient states in an absorbing Markov chain; death is an absorbing state. This paper presents Markov chain methods for computing the mean and variance of the lifetime number of visits to any transient state, the mean and variance of longevity, the net reproductive rate R0, and the cohort generation time. It presents the matrix calculus methods needed to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of all these indices to any life history parameters. These sensitivities have many uses, including calculation of selection gradients. It is shown that the use of R0 as a measure of fitness or an invasion exponent gives erroneous results except when R0=λ= 1. The Markov chain approach is then generalized to variable environments (deterministic environmental sequences, periodic environments, iid random environments, Markovian environments). Variable environments are analyzed using the vec-permutation method to create a model that classifies individuals jointly by the stage and environmental condition. Throughout, examples are presented using the North Atlantic right whale (Eubaleana glacialis) and an endangered prairie plant (Lomatium bradshawii) in a stochastic fire environment. © 2009 Oikos.",,"demography; endangered species; environmental change; generation time; life cycle; life history; longevity; Markov chain; plant community; prairie; reproductive status; stochasticity; variance analysis; whale; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lomatium bradshawii",,,,,,,,"Abadir, K.M., Magnus, J.R., (2005) Matrix Algebra.

This paper focuses on applications of passive acoustic technologies over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is divided into sections dealing with archival and real-time passive acoustic sensor applications. Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors. © Inter-Research 2009.","Archival arrays; Automated detection; Fish; Localization; Marine mammals; Mesoscale; Passive acoustics; Real-time buoys; Towed arrays","abundance; automation; bioacoustics; buoy system; conservation management; data set; endangered species; fish; marine ecosystem; marine mammal; real time; reproductive strategy; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; tracking; vocalization; Brazil; Cetacea; Erignathus; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Melanogrammus",,,,,,,,"Akamatsu, T., Wang, D., Wang, K., Wei, Z., Comparison between visual and passive acoustic detection of finless porpoise in the Yangtze River, China (2001) J Acoust Soc Am, 109, pp. 1723-1727; Anderson, P.K., Barclay, R.M.R., Dugong acoustic signals: Physical characteristics, individual differences, and behavioral correlates (1995) J Mammal, 76, pp. 1226-1237; Au, D., Perryman, W., Movement and speed of dolphin schools responding to an approaching ship (1982) Fish Bull, 80, pp. 371-379; Barlow, J., Gisiner, R., Mitigating, monitoring and assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on beaked whales (2006) J Cetacean Res Manag, 7, pp. 239-249; Barlow, J., Rankin, S., False killer whale abundance and density: Preliminary estimates for the PICEAS study area south of Hawaii and new estimates for the US EEZ around Hawaii (2007) SWFSC Admin Report LJ-07-102; Barlow, J., Taylor, B.L., Estimates of sperm whale abundance in the northeastern temperate Pacific from a combined acoustic and visual survey (2005) Mar Mamm Sci, 21, pp. 429-445; Barnes, C.R., Best, M.M.R., Bornhold, B.D., Juniper, S.K., Pirenne, B., Phibbs, P., The NEPTUNE Project-a cabled ocean observatory in the NE Pacific: Overview, challenges and scientific objectives for the installation and operation of Stage I in Canadian waters (2007) Symposium on Underwater Technology and Workshop on Scientific Use of Submarine Cables and Related Technologies, , Tokyo, Japan.

In this study, we compared the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of a metal pollutant, hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], which has been shown to cause damage in lung cells from both humans and North Atlantic right whales. Our results show that Cr induces increased cell death and chromosome damage in lung cells from both species with increasing intracellular Cr ion levels. Soluble Cr(VI) induced less of a cytotoxic and genotoxic effect based on administered dose in right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) cells than in human (Homo sapiens) cells. Whereas, particulate Cr(VI) induced a similar cytotoxic effect but less of a genotoxic effect based on administered dose in right whale cells than in human cells. Differences in chromium ion uptake explained soluble chromate-induced cell death but not all of the soluble chromate-induced chromosome damage. Uptake differences of lead ions could explain the differences in particulate chromate-induced toxicity. The data show that both forms of Cr(VI) are less genotoxic to right whale than human lung cells, and that soluble Cr(VI) induces a similar cytotoxic effect in both right whale and human cells, while particulate Cr(VI) is more cytotoxic to right whale lung cells. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, only rarely are these 2 independent data sets systematically compared with each other to estimate the error rates inherent in these studies. Here, >25 years of photo-identification data on the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) were compared with high-resolution genetic profiles, available for >75% of the individuals in the photo-identification catalog, in order to identify sources and rates of errors associated with both methods of individual identification. The resulting estimates were 0.0308 errors/identification for the photo-identification data, and 0.00121 errors/locus and 0.0327 errors/multilocus profile for the genetic data. These are among the lowest error rates yet reported, and indicate that the approaches used provide reliable means of individual identification for this species. However, despite these low error rates, the large size of the data sets results in a nonnegligible estimated number of errors, indicating that the potential for these errors needs to be incorporated into other analyses that are based on these data. A similar situation likely exists in other long-term studies where, although error rates are assumed to be low, the size of the data set results in a large number of errors that will influence subsequent analyses. Regularly conducting and reporting extensive database comparisons such as this is invaluable for maintaining the integrity of long-term data sets by identifying where sources of error are occurring and how protocols can be improved to lower error rates in the future. © 2009 American Society of Mammalogists.","Error rates; Genotyping; Individual identification; Photo-identification; Right whale","conservation genetics; endangered species; error correction; genotype; identification method; species conservation; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Amos, W., Hoelzel, A.R., DNA fingerprinting cetacean biopsy samples for individual identification (1990) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 12 (SPECI.

A suitable collection method and analytical technique using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed. Blow samples were collected opportunistically from free-ranging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 35) and North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (n = 18) using a 13-m carbon fiber pole with a collection device. Samples were analyzed for the presence of testosterone and progesterone using a 55% isocratic gradient with LC-MS. Testosterone was detected in four humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. Progesterone was detected in seven humpback whale samples and eight northern right whale samples. This is the first documented use of lung mucosa to determine the presence of reproductive hormones in any free-swimming cetacean and may provide a novel non-invasive technique to quantify the hormonal condition of free-swimming animals that spend brief periods of time at the water's surface. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Blow; Progesterone; Testosterone; Whale","feasibility study; hormone; identification method; reproduction; steroid; swimming; whale; Animalia; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,,"Atkinson, S., Combelles, C., Vincent, D., Natchigall, P., Pawloski, J., Breese, M., Monitoring of progesterone in captive female false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens (1999) General and Comparative Endocrinology, 115, pp. 323-332. , and; Bressolle, F., Bromet-Petit, M., Audran, M., Validation of liquid chromatographic and gas chromatographic methods: Applications to pharmacokinetics (1996) Journal of Chromatography B, 686, pp. 3-10. , and; Brittebo, E.B., Metabolism of progesterone by the nasal mucosa in mice and rats (1982) Acta Pharmacology and Toxicology (Copenhagen), 51, pp. 441-445; Brittebo, E.B., Localization of oestradiol in the rat nasal mucosa (1985) Acta Pharmacology and Toxicology (Copenhagen), 57, pp. 285-290; Brittebo, E.B., Rafter, J.J., Steroid metabolism by rat nasal mucosa: Studies on progesterone and testosterone (1984) Journal of Steroid Biochemistry, 20, pp. 1147-1151. , and; Chittleborough, R.G., Southern right whale in Australian waters (1956) Journal of Mammalogy, 37, pp. 456-457; Chittleborough, R.G., The breeding cycle of the female humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre) (1958) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 9, pp. 1-18; Chittleborough, R.G., Dynamics of two populations of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaengliae (Borowski) (1965) Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 16, pp. 33-128; Connor, M.L., Sanford, L.M., Howland, B.E., Saliva progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle and late pregnancy (1982) Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, 60, pp. 410-413. , and; Constable, S., Parslow, A., Dutton, G., Rogers, T., Hogg, C., Urinary cortisol sampling: A non-invasive technique for examining cortisol concentrations in the Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddellii (2006) Zoo Biology, 25, pp. 137-144. , and; Cross, N., Pines, M.K., Rogers, L.J., Saliva sampling to assess cortisol levels in unrestrained common marmosets and the effect of behavioral stress (2004) American Journal of Primatology, 62, pp. 107-114. , and; Czekala, N., Sicotte, P., Reproductive monitoring of free-ranging female mountain gorillas by urinary hormone analysis (2000) American Journal of Primatology, 51, pp. 209-215. , and; Czekala, N.M., Robbins, M.M., Assessment of reproduction and stress through hormone analysis in gorillas (2001) Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology, 27, pp. 317-339. , and; Dawbin, W.A., Whale marking in South Pacific waters (1956) The Norwegian Whaling Gazette, 9, pp. 485-508; Dellman, H.D., Eurell, J., (1998) Textbook of Veterinary Histology. 5th Edition., , and.

The goal of the study is to develop a numerical modeling tool to predict the forces and stresses during impact and thereby the resulting mortality risk to whales from ship strikes. Based on post-mortem examinations, jaw fracture was chosen as a fatal endpoint for the whales hit by a vessel. In this paper we investigate the overall mechanical behavior of a right whale mandible under transverse loading and develop a finite element analysis model of the bone. The equivalent elastic modulus of the cortical component of right whale mandible is found by comparing full-scale bending tests with the results of numerical modeling. The finite element model of the mandible can be used in conjunction with a vessel-whale collision event model to predict bone fracture for various ship strike scenarios. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the adverse effects of these toxicants in marine mammals are uncertain. Previously, we reported that North Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered great whales, have tissue chromium levels that are high, levels that may pose a risk to the whale's health. Furthermore, the study suggested that inhalation may be an important exposure route. Exposure to chromium through inhalation is mainly because of particulate compounds. However, the toxicity of particulate chromium compounds in marine mammal cells is unknown. Accordingly, in this study, we tested the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of particulate hexavalent chromium in primary cultured lung and skin fibroblasts from the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Cytotoxicity was measured by clonogenic survival assay, and genotoxicity was measured as production of chromosome aberrations. Particulate hexavalent chromium induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner in both right whale lung and skin fibroblasts. Lung fibroblasts were more resistant to chromium cytotoxicity, but presented with more chromosome damage than skin fibroblasts. These data further support the hypothesis that chromium may be a health concern for the endangered North Atlantic right whale. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cytotoxicity; Genotoxicity; Marine mammal; North Atlantic right whale; Particulate chromium","chromium; chromium hexavalent ion; animal cell; article; chromosome damage; cytotoxicity; genotoxicity; in vitro study; lung; nonhuman; skin fibroblast; survival; whale; animal; cell culture; cell survival; chemically induced disorder; chromosome aberration; cytology; drug effect; fibroblast; lung; metabolism; skin; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Animals; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Chromium; Chromosome Aberrations; Fibroblasts; Lung; Skin; Whales",,"chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; Chromium, 7440-47-3; chromium hexavalent ion, 18540-29-9",,,,,,"(2000) Toxicological Profile for Chromium, , Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

Here, we describe a system that can produce useful estimates of right whale Eubalaena glacialis presence and abundance on their feeding grounds in the Gulf of Maine. The foundation of our system is a coupled physical-biological model of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the preferred prey of right whales. From the modeled prey densities, we can estimate when whales will appear in the Great South Channel feeding ground. Based on our experience with the system, we consider how the relationship between right whales and copepods changes across spatial scales. The scale-dependent relationship between whales and copepods provides insight into how to improve future estimates of the distribution of right whales and other pelagic predators. © Inter-Research 2009.","Calanus finmarchicus; Eubalaena glacialis; Gulf of Maine; Model; Population dynamics","abundance; crustacean; ecological modeling; feeding ground; habitat use; human activity; population distribution; population dynamics; prey availability; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Great South Channel; Gulf of Maine; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Barton, A.D., Greene, C.H., Monger, B.C., Pershing, A.J., Continuous plankton recorder survey phytoplankton measurements and the North Atlantic Oscillation: Interannual to multidecadal variability in the Northwest Shelf, Northeast Shelf, and Central North Atlantic Ocean (2003) Prog Oceanogr, 58, pp. 337-358; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol.

Local environmental conditions that influence movements of feeding right whales, such as ultradense copepod patches, are unpredictable and ephemeral. We examined the utility of using the regional-scale mean copepod concentration as an indicator of the abundance of right whales in 2 critical habitats off the northeastern coast of the United States: Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Right whales are usually found in Cape Cod Bay during the late winter and early spring, and in the Great South Channel during the late spring and early summer. We found a significant positive relationship between mean concentration of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in the western Gulf of Maine and the frequency of right whale sightings in the Great South Channel. In Cape Cod Bay we found a significant positive relationship between the mean concentration of other copepods (largely Pseudocalanus spp. and Centropages spp.) and the frequency of right whale sightings. This information could be used to further our understanding of the environmental factors that drive seasonal movement and aggregation of right whales in the Gulf of Maine, and it offers a tool to resource managers and modelers who seek to predict the movements of right whales based upon the concentration of copepods. © Inter-Research 2009.","Calanus finmarchicus; Cape Cod Bay; Centropages; Eubalaena glacialis; Great South Channel; Prey density; Pseudocalanus; Right whale","abundance; crustacean; environmental conditions; human activity; management practice; mortality; movement; prey availability; resource management; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Cape Cod Bay; Great South Channel; Gulf of Maine; Massachusetts; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Centropages; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis; Pseudocalanus",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England.

Within the environment, marine waters are a common site for hexavalent chromium deposition. We have recently reported significantly high levels of chromium in skin tissue from North Atlantic right whales. These findings demonstrate that marine species are being exposed to chromium. It is possible that such exposures may be playing a role in population declines evident among certain marine mammals, such as the Steller sea lion. We developed a Steller sea lion lung cell line from Steller sea lion lung tissue. Hexavalent chromium was cytotoxic to these primary lung fibroblasts as 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 μM sodium chromate induced 104, 99, 92, 58 and 11% relative survival, respectively. It was also genotoxic as 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged chromosomes in 6, 11, 21, 36, and 39% of metaphases and damaged 6, 12, 27, 49 and 57 total aberrations in 100 metaphases, respectively. We also considered the toxicity of particulate hexavalent chromium, as it is the more potent carcinogen in humans. We found that 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 μg/cm2 particulate chromate induced 95, 88, 91, 70, and 52% relative cell survival, respectively. These concentrations were genotoxic and damaged chromosomes in 9, 13, 18, and 23% of metaphases and induced 9, 15, 20 and 30 total aberrations per 100 metaphases, respectively. These data indicate that if sufficiently exposed, chromium may adversely affect the struggling Steller sea lion population. It would be prudent to investigate the effects chromium has in other Steller sea lion organs in order to derive a better understanding of how chromium in the marine environment may be affecting the declining Steller sea lion population. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Marine resource managers are charged with conserving and managing many diverse species. Southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), commonly known as whiting, are found from southern New England to Florida. During the fall through winter, western North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are primarily found in the coastal nearshore waters off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, overlapping the whiting's range and habitat. In January 2006, a right whale calf was discovered dead, as a result of gillnet entanglement, in close proximity to the Florida commercial whiting fishing grounds; thus, to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with developing appropriated right whale conservation management measures, this study evaluated the newly established commercial Florida whiting fishery. Findings revealed that the whiting fishery was established in 2004 and the fishery was prosecuted during the time and area where right whales were found. Moreover, the study found that whiting landings, market value, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), dealers, and fishing effort significantly increased during 2000 through 2005. As a result of the right whale calf mortality and threat of gillnet gear to whales, the NMFS prohibited the use of gillnet gear in the US southeastern waters, which inevitably closed the newly established whiting fishery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Calanus possesses 2 classes of storage lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and wax esters (WE), the latter comprising 94% of total lipids. Most mammals are incapable of metabolizing WE and thus eliminate it in their feces. The objective of this study was to determine whether right whales are capable of metabolizing both TAG and WE. We compared the lipid composition of copepods collected during plankton tows (n = 64) over 2 summers (2006 and 2007) with the lipid composition of 24 right whale fecal samples collected synoptically in the Bay of Fundy. Using ingestion and defecation models, we estimated that an average right whale (40 000 kg) ingests ∼58000 g of WE d-1 but eliminates only 250 g of WE, implying that right whales are assimilating over 99% (57765 g) of dietary WE. Lipids in the feces differed significantly from those of the diet. Copepod lipids were dominated by saturated fatty acid (FA) components 14:0 (14.73 ± 0.32wt%) and 16:0 (8.99 ± 0.20 wt%), with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated components comprising the remainder. Long chain monounsaturated 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-11 dominated the fatty alcohol composition of copepods. Fecal lipid composition consisted primarily of saturated FA, many of which were absent in the copepods. These data suggest that right whales have evolved an unusual metabolic capability, such as specialized enzymatic machinery or a gut symbiont, which, unlike other mammals, enables them to utilize most of their WE-rich diet. © Inter-Research 2009.","Calanus finmarchicus; Copepod; Eubalaena glacialis; Feeding; Lipid metabolism; Right whale; Triacylglycerol; Wax ester","diet; enzyme activity; ester; fatty acid; ingestion rate; lipid; metabolism; symbiont; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Ackman, R., McLeod, C., Banerjee, A., An overview of analyses by chromarod-iatroscan TLC-FID (1990) J Planar Chromatogr Mod TLC, 3, pp. 450-490; Baumgartner, M.F., Comparisons of Calanus finmarchicus fifth copepodite abundance estimates from nets and an optical plankton counter (2003) J Plankton Res, 25, pp. 855-868; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Baumgartner, M.F., Mayo, C.A., Kenney, R.D., Enormous carnivores, microscopic food, and a restaurant that's hard to find (2007) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, pp. 138-171. , Kraus SD, Rolland RM eds, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, p; Blueweiss, L., Fox, H., Kudzma, V., Nakashima, D., Peters, R., Sams, S., Relationships between body size and some life history parameters (1978) Oecologia, 37, pp. 257-272; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell, R.L., Baleen whales: Conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mammal Rev, 29, pp. 37-60; Comita, G.W., Marshall, S.M., Orr, A.P., On the biology of Calanus finmarchicus XIII.

I used latent class analysis to partition responses from a national Internet-based survey that asked respondents about their preferred conservation program from amongst scenarios that varied according to target species (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, Atlantic whitefish Coregonus huntsmani, leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, porbeagle shark Lamna nasus, and white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus), program performance, cost, and method of payment. The large sample of the Canadian public (n = 2761) cleaved into 9 distinct segments that varied significantly in their patterns of preferences. Mean implicit prices, calculated using regression coefficients, ranged as high as CAD $85.99 annually for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. There was strong support for programs that had a high probability of success even though increases in population abundance and improvements in listing status were each only significant for 4 of the 9 segments. I also found evidence that members of 1 segment were unwilling or unable to make tradeoffs between the program attributes (i.e. they exhibited 'lexicographic preferences'). Members from all 9 segments were distributed across Canada, implying that the proper geographic scope of benefits assessments should be expanded beyond the regions in which regional aquatic species at risk actually occur. These findings should help ensure that the broad societal benefits of conservation are captured when making endangered species listing and investment decisions in Canada in the future. © Inter-Reaserch 2009.","Choice experiment; Endangered species; Internet survey; Latent class analysis; Passive use value; Species at Risk Act","abundance; aquatic organism; endangered species; Internet; species conservation; species inventory; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; North America; Acipenser transmontanus; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Coregonus huntsmani; Dermochelyidae; Dermochelys coriacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lamna nasus; Lamnidae; Salmo salar; Testudines",,,,,,,,"Alvarez, R.M., Sherman, R.P., VanBeselaere, C., Subject acquisition for web-based surveys (2003) Polit Anal, 11, pp. 23-43; Bergstrom, J.C., Boyle, K.J., Trading taxes vs. paying taxes to value and finance public environmental goods (2004) Environ Resour Econ, 28, pp. 533-549. , YabeM; Birol, E., Karousakis, K., Koundouri, P., Using a choice experiment to account for preference heterogeneity in wetland attributes: The case of Cheimaditida wetland in Greece (2006) Ecol Econ, 60, pp. 145-156; Boxall, P.C., Adamowicz, W.L., Understanding heterogeneous preferences in random utility models: A latent class approach (2002) Environ Resour Econ, 23, pp. 421-446; Carson, R.T., Mitchell, R.C., Hanemann, M., Kopp, R.J., Presser, S., Ruud, P.A., Contingent valuation and lost passive use: Damages from the Exxon Valdez oil spill (2003) Environ Resour Econ, 25, pp. 257-286; Christie, M., Hanley, N., Warren, J., Murphy, K., Wright, R., Hyde, T., Valuing the diversity of biodiversity (2006) Ecol Econ, 58, pp. 304-317; Couper, M.P., Kapteyn, A., Schonlau, M., Winter, J., Noncoverage and nonresponse in an Internet survey (2007) Soc Sci Res, 36, pp. 131-148; (2006) Potential socio-economic implications of adding porbeagle shark to the list of wildlife species at risk in the Species at Risk Act (SARA), , DFO Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Dartmouth; Environment Canada (2003) Species at Risk Act: a guide.

In the southeastern US, commercial fishermen target black sea bass (Centropristis striata) with pots from North Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida. During the fall through spring fishing season, western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) distribution overlaps the black sea bass commercial pot fishery. Fishermen interviews revealed that the number of pots set ranged from 3 to 240 and the number of pots set per trawl ranged from 1 to 18.

The analysis of the EST collection (archived at www.marinegenomics.org and GenBank) showed a 34.79% redundancy, yielding 1578 unigenes and 27 potential microsatellite markers. 96 genes were cloned by targeted PCR; moreover, 52 of these genes are stress and immune function related. A Gene Ontology analysis of the unigene collection indicates that the skin is a rich source of expressed genes with diverse functions, suggesting an important role in multiple physiological processes including those related to immunity and stress response. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A proposed solution is based on a multistage, hypothesis-testing technique that involves the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, spectrogram testing, and feature vector testing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are the inclusion of noise kernels for signals likely to produce false alarms and a second stage classification algorithm which extracts parameters from candidate contact calls and constructs a scaled squared error statistic for parameters which lie outside the range of expected calls. Closed-form representations of the algorithms are derived and realizable detection schemes are developed. Test results show that the proposed technique is able to detect approximately 80% of the contact calls detected by the human operator with about 26 false alarms per 24 h of observation. Testing data set included 44 227 right whale contact calls detected by eight human operators who performed visual and aural inspection of the data spectrogram. Data were collected in different periods from March 2001 to February 2007, in Cape Cod Bay, Great South Channel, and in the coastal waters of Georgia. © 2009, by The Institute of Electrical Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Medaka (Oryzias latipes) has been used as a model species for human and aquatic health, including the marine environment, though few studies have directly compared toxicological responses in medaka to humans or other aquatic species. We used a medaka fin cell line to compare the genotoxic response of medaka to Cr(VI) to the response observed in North Atlantic right whale cells to see if responses in medaka were similar to those of other aquatic species, particularly aquatic mammals. We used the production of chromosomal aberrations as a measure of genotoxicity. We found that in medaka cells, concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged 17, 32 and 43% of metaphases, respectively and these same concentrations 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 μM sodium chromate damaged 14, 24 and 49% of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale lung cells and 11, 32 and 41% of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale testes cells. These data show that genotoxic responses in medaka are comparable to those seen in North Atlantic right whale cells, consistent with the hypothesis that medaka are a useful model for other aquatic species. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In eastern Canadian waters, entanglement deaths of the critically endangered transboundary North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) are a key conservation concern and incidental mortalities of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in gillnets are a major source of mortality. Since the 1990s, a number of mitigation techniques to reduce mortalities in both species have been tested and the use of some in the US commercial fishery have been legislated. Despite this, the North Atlantic right whale population remains in a precarious state and entanglement deaths of harbour porpoise have been increasing in recent years. Further, mitigation devices, such as acoustic alarms, carry with them concerns about habituation, noise pollution, maintenance requirements and cost. The modifying of the physical characteristics of commercial fishing gear has shown some promise at reducing entanglement mortalities in initial testing while avoiding many of the drawbacks of other mitigation methods. In this study the current state of development and effectiveness of mitigation techniques through the addition of barium sulphate to fishing gear rope and twine were investigated. The development of a neutrally buoyant groundline, through the addition of barium sulphate, was undertaken in order to reduce the probability of large whale entanglements in lobster pot gear. The resulting product maintained a much lower profile in the water column relative to traditional polypropylene groundline, however, it was found unsuitable for hard-bottom areas as it was susceptible to chaffing and breaking. In order to reduce mortalities once large whales are entangled, a weak rope was developed again with the addition of barium sulphate. The breaking strength of this product was found to be 1,0651b which meets the US legislated limits (1,1001b), as opposed to traditional polypropylene rope which had a breaking strength of over 2,4001b. To meet the challenge of harbour porpoise entanglements, a gillnet twine was developed to have an increased acoustic profile and a more stiff form through the addition of barium sulphate. In field testing trials, the barium sulphate modified gillnets reduced harbour porpoise bycatch and had minimal effects on targeted groundfishes. Although they are in an early state of development, barium sulphate modified fishing gear shows promise at reducing entanglement deaths of cetaceans.","Atlantic ocean; Conservation; Echolocation; Fish; Fisheries; Gillnets; Harbour porpoise; Incidental catches; North America; North Atlantic right whale; Northern hemisphere; Sustainability","alarm signal; anthropogenic effect; barium; commercial activity; echolocation; fishery; fishing gear; gillnet; mitigation; mortality; Northern Hemisphere; porpoise; sulfate; sustainability; whale; Atlantic Ocean; North America; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,,"Au, W., Kastelein, R., Rippe, T., Schooneman, N., Transmission beam pattern and echolation signals of a harbor porpoise (1999) (Phocoena Phocoena).

Hence, any viable conservation strategy must include mitigation of this risk. In particular, the critical wintering habitat off the Atlantic shores of the southeastern United States overlaps with the shipping routes of some of the region's busiest ports. As a first step in the process of ship strike risk mitigation for this region, we estimated the risk associated with current patterns of shipping traffic, and compared this with estimates of risk for a set of hypothetical alternative routes. As a measure of risk, we selected the co-occurrence of whales and vessels within cells of a 4 km grid. We performed parametric estimation of whale encounter rate and associated risk within a Bayesian hierarchical model, using data from aerial surveys and the Mandatory Ship Reporting System of the SE United States, along with a selection of environmental covariates. Importantly, we were able to account for annual and monthly variation in encounters in our estimates. All alternative routes provided reduced overall risk, ranging from a 27 to 44% reduction, relative to the estimated risk of observed traffic. The largest marginal gains in risk reduction were attained by restricting traffic associated with the busiest port, Jacksonville, Florida, but restrictions on all ports achieved the highest reduction. We emphasize the importance of accounting for temporal as well as spatial variation in whale encounter rates, given the migratory behavior of the species. © Inter-Research 2008.","Bayesian model; Eubalaena glacialis; Hierarchical model; Right whale; Risk analysis","Bayesian analysis; hierarchical system; modeling; risk assessment; species conservation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); North America; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Besag, J., Kooperberg, C., On conditional and intrinsic autoregressions (1995) Biometrika, 82, pp. 733-746; Fujiwara, M., Caswell, H., Demography of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 537-541; Gamerman, D., (1997) Markov chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic simulation for Bayesian inference, , Chapman & Hall, London; Gelfand, A.E., Vounatsou, P., Proper multivariate conditional autoregressive models for spatial data analysis (2003) Biostatistics, 4 (1), pp. 11-15; Gelman, A.E., Carlin, J.B., Stern, H.S., Rubin, D.B., (2004) Bayesian data analysis, , 2nd edn.

During January-May, 1998-2002, 167 aerial surveys were conducted (66,466 km of total survey effort), providing a complete representation of the spatiotemporal distribution of right whales in the bay during winter and spring. A total of 1553 right whales were sighted; some of these sightings were multiple sightings of the same individuals. Right whale distribution and relative abundance patterns were quantified as sightings per unit of effort (SPUE) and partitioned into 103 23-km2 cells and 12 2-week periods. Significant interannual variations in mean SPUE and timing of SPUE maxima were likely due to physically forced changes in available food resources. The area of greatest SPUE expanded and contracted during the season but its center remained in the eastern bay. Most cells with SPUE&gt;0 were inside the federal critical habitat (CH) and this finding gave evidence of the need for management measures within CH boundaries to reduce anthropogenic mortality from vessel strikes and entanglement. There was significant within-season SPUE variability: low in December-January, increasing to a maximum in late February-early April, and declining to zero in May; and these results provide support for management measures from 1 January-15 May.",,"Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Mem.

The structures of recorded calls were broadly similar to those reported from other areas, but lacked the stereotypical patterning of those signals thought to represent reproductive displays. Counts of non-patterned blue whale calls indicated low vocalisation rates, with a mean of 0.62 phrases per whale per hour (0.12 A-B and 0.49 arch phrases per whale per hour). However, vocalisations were highly clustered in time, with 80% of blue whale calls ascribed to the focal animals arriving within a single 80 second period. It is not clear what behavioural, geographical or seasonal trends may influence the vocalisation rate of large baleen whales, and thus direct comparisons between areas are difficult. However, it is hoped the results presented will be of use in interpreting remote recordings of blue whales made from the North Atlantic. Hydrophones were also monitored continuously over 7,757km of trackline using an automated detection algorithm developed for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). However, no North Atlantic right whales were seen or heard during the study period.","Acoustics; Atlantic Ocean; Blue whale; Fin whale; North Atlantic right whale; Northern Hemisphere; Survey-acoustic; Vocalisation","acoustic survey; algorithm; behavioral ecology; detection method; hydrophone; seasonality; signaling; vocalization; whale; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Eurasia; Europe; Greenland; Iceland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Bass, A.H., Clark, C.W., The physical acoustics of underwater sound communication (2003) Acoustic Communication: Springer Handbook of Auditory Research, pp. 15-64. , Fay, R. and Popper, A, eds, Springer-Verlag, New York; Berchok, C.L., Bradley, D.L., Gabrielson, T.B., St. Lawrence blue whale vocalizations revisited: Characterisation of calls detected from 1998 to 2001 (2006) J.

Sixteen of the events involved whales that apparently survived. Events were recorded in all months except January and 65% occurred in the period July to October. Mortalities were more numerous in the western half of the continent where southern right whales are more frequently observed. Events were classified according to their outcome and nature: carcasses (with no evidence of human interaction) n=25, fatal entanglements n=1, non-fatal entanglements n=12, fatal vessel collisions n=2, non-fatal vessel collisions n=3, non-fatal shooting n=1. No live strandings were recorded. The number of both mortalities and non-fatal anthropogenic incidents has increased 4-fold since the mid 1970s. More calves than 'non-calf' whales were present in the carcass category, whereas the opposite was the case for events involving hurnan interaction. Lines, nets and buoys used in fishing crustaceans (rock-lobster, crab) were associated with several entanglements (n=5). A longline entanglement of a 14m female resulted in a chronic injury, debilitation and death. As a proportion of the total records for each region, there were fewer vessel collisions of right whales in Australia (11%) than in South Africa (16%) or the North Atlantic (35%).","Australasia; Incidental catches; North Atlantic right whale; Southern Hemisphere; Southern right whale; Strandings; Vessel collisions","anthropogenic effect; mortality; survival; whale; wildlife management; Africa; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Australasia; Australia; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Australia.

We use vessel traffic and right whale survey data (∼3 nautical miles [n miles], ∼5.6 km resolution) for the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (northwest Atlantic) to determine the relative risk of lethal vessel encounters by using 2 estimates: (1) the event - the relative probability of a vessel encountering a right whale, and (2) the consequence - the probability of a lethal injury arising from an encounter. For the Bay of Fundy region our estimates demonstrate that the relative risk of lethal collision could be reduced by 62 % by means of an amendment to the traffic separation scheme (TSS) that intersects a Right Whale Conservation Area. In the Roseway Basin region of the Scotian Shelf, the majority of vessels navigate outside of a Right Whale Conservation Area, although the highest relative risk is concentrated within the Conservation Area where fewer vessels navigate at greater speed. Here, our estimates demonstrate that a seasonal recommendatory area to be avoided (ATBA) could be designed to reduce the risk imposed by vessels upon right whales in the region. Our estimates contributed to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adoption of a TSS amendment in the Bay of Fundy and an ATBA on the Scotian Shelf. Thus, the goal of achieving the greatest reduction in the risk of lethal vessel-encounters with whales, balanced by some minimal disruption to vessel operations while maintaining safe navigation, can be achieved. © Inter-Research 2008.","Collision; Eubalaena glacialis; Fundy; Lethal encounter; Mortality; Right whale; Roseway; Shipping; Strike; Vessel","collision avoidance; ecological impact; endangered species; estimation method; mortality risk; shipping; species conservation; vessel; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Scotia Shelf; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mayo, C.A., Kenney, R.D., Enormous carnivores, microscopic food, and a restaurant that's hard to find (2007) The urban whale: North Atlantic right whales at the crossroads, pp. 138-171. , Kraus SD, Rolland RM eds, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, p; Brown MW, Allen JM, Kraus SD (1995) The designation of seasonal right whale conservation areas in the waters of Atlantic Canada.

Genetically profiling the feces facilitates this connection when the sample originator is unknown. Although genetic analysis of feces collected in terrestrial systems has become well established, genetic studies of cetacean DNA are rare. Here, the use of free-floating feces as a source of right whale DNA and the reliability of the genotypes produced are examined. On average, fecal extracts yielded 25 ng of DNA/mg dry weight, but less than 1% was right whale DNA. Although all samples were amplified using genus-specific mitochondrial control region primers, the quantity of right whale DNA present was over estimated when compared to amplifications using nuclear primers. No correlation was found between the quantity of right whale DNA recovered and the duration the sample sat in the water. Composite microsatellite profiles from multiple amplifications of 28 fecal samples of known origin were consistent with profiles of the same individuals obtained from skin biopsies, however, the rate of allelic dropout varied depending on the amount of right whale DNA added. A screening and genotyping protocol for reliable genetic profiling based on fecal DNA quantification is presented. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Allelic dropout; DNA quantification; Eubalaena glacialis;

Under straight pull abrasion tests, an adult right whale fluke required 3.7 times the load and 15 times the draw-length of a right whale calf flipper to induce epidermal failure whereas a humpback fluke was intermediate between these extremes. A load applied tangentially to the leading edge of the fluke or flipper resulted in a substantial, but reversible, deflection of the leading edge in the direction of the applied load. The maximum possible deformation of the leading edge under shear load, prior to the line slipping relative to the skin, was defined as the tissue compliance limit. Oscillatory abrasion tests revealed that line draw-lengths exceeding the tissue compliance limit resulted in substantially increased tissue abrasion. In actual entanglements, line draw-length relative to the tissue compliance may determine if the line will cut into the body or simply press against the skin. Increasing the entangling line's ability to stretch in response to a load could potentially minimize sliding of the line relative to the skin and help mitigate entanglement injuries. © 2008 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Cetacean; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Humpback whale; Injury; Megaptera novaeangliae; Modeling; Right whale","ecological modeling; experimental study; injury; muscle; skin; testing method; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Trematoda",,,,,,,,"Cloete, S.W.P., Schalkwyk, S.J.V., Hoffman, L.C., Meyer, A., Effect of age on leather and skin traits of slaughter ostriches (2004) South African Journal of Animal Science, 34, pp. 80-86. , and; Cua, A.B., Wilhelm, K.P., Maibach, H.I., Elastic properties of human skin: Relation to age, sex, and anatomical region (1990) Archives of Dermatological Research, 282, pp. 283-288. , and; Fung, Y.C., (1981) Biomechanics., , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Geraci, J.R., Lounsbury, V.J., (2005) Marine Mammals Ashore: A Field Guide for Strandings., , and.

The present study investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of hexavalent chromium in primary cultured North Atlantic right whale lung and testes fibroblasts and levels of total chromium in skin biopsies from North Atlantic right whales. Cytotoxicity was measured by clonogenic survival assay. Genotoxicity was measured as production of chromosome aberrations. Tissue chromium levels were determined from skin biopsies of healthy free-ranging whales in the Bay of Fundy using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Hexavalent chromium-induced concentration-dependent increases in right whale lung and testes fibroblast cytotoxicity with the testes more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects. It also induced concentration-dependent increases in chromosomal aberrations in both cell types with no significant difference in sensitivity. Skin biopsy data indicate that North Atlantic right whales are exposed to chromium and accumulate a range of 4.9-10 μg Cr/g tissue with a mean of 7.1 μg/g. Hexavalent chromium is cytotoxic and genotoxic to North Atlantic right whale cells. The whales have tissue chromium levels that are concerning. These data support a hypothesis that chromium may be a concern for the health of the North Atlantic right whales. Considering these data with chromium chemistry, whale physiology and atmospheric chromium levels further suggest that inhalation may be an important exposure route. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

On 1 January 2005, during the New England Aquarium research team's standard aerial survey, a single right whale was observed at the surface 17 nmi east of the northern tip of Talbot Island, Florida. While circling over the whale to obtain photographs for individual identification, observers noticed a red coloration visible in the water around the whale that looked like blood. The water around the whale's belly, side, and flukes was clearly red, but the color was dispersing quickly due to the thrashing behavior of the whale. After 3 min and 37 s of observation, a calf appeared to the side of the adult. The calf had no visible cyamid coverage on the head, body, or flukes. The flukes appeared to be slightly limp and curled under at both tips. The mother lifted the calf to the surface on her back. As the mother rose to the surface, the calf was draped limply over her body. The calf rolled off the mother's back into the water and began to swim next to the mother. The event described here is the first known observation of behaviors that have been interpreted as a birth of a right whale calf.","Birth; Calf; Cetacean; Eubalaena glacialis; Reproduction; Right whale","birth date; coastal zone; reproduction; whale; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Cyamida; Eubalaena glacialis; Trematoda",,,,,,,,"Beland, P., Faucher, A., Corbeil, P., Observations on the birth of a beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada (1990) Canadian Journal of Zoology Zoology, 68, pp. 1327-1329; Brown, M.

Injuries seen in vessel-struck whales fall into two distinct categories: 1) sharp trauma, often resulting from contact with the propeller, and 2) blunt trauma, presumably resulting from contact with a vessel's hull. This study analyzes four trauma cases that resulted from vessel-whale collisions, which together provide a framework for a more critical understanding of lethal blunt and sharp trauma resulting from vessel collisions with right whales. In case no. 1, contact with a propeller resulted in three deep lacerations. The animal survived acute trauma only to succumb nearly 14 years later when the lesions reopened and became infected. In case no. 2, anecdotal reports linked the laceration of large arteries of the peduncle and histologic evidence of perimortem trauma at a bone fracture site to vessel-whale collision trauma. Case no. 3 had a laceration of the oral rete and a fracture of the rostrum. Both of the areas displayed histologic evidence of perimortem blunt trauma. Finally, in case no. 4, an antemortem mandibular fracture, two additional skull fractures, and widespread hemorrhage were consistent with severe blunt trauma. Evidence from each case, including the timing of trauma relative to the time of death and identifying characteristics of both trauma types, are presented. Before this study, no detailed comparative analysis of trauma pathology that resulted from lethal interactions between vessels and right whales had been conducted. This study demonstrates the importance of detailed gross and histologic examination in determining the significance and timing of traumatic events. This work represents a new paradigm for the differential diagnosis of lethal sharp and blunt trauma in right whales hit by ships and will enhance the present understanding of the impact of anthropogenic mortality on this critically endangered species.

The hunting that occurred during this period is of primary significance for the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), because it has been interpreted as the largest human-induced reduction of the western North Atlantic population, with ∼12250-21000 whales killed. It has been frequently reported that the Basques targeted two species in this region: the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. To evaluate this hypothesis and the relative impact of this period of whaling on both species, we collected samples from 364 whale bones during a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Bones were found and sampled at 10 of the 20 sites investigated. DNA was extracted from a subset (n = 218) of these samples. Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b region identified five whale species. The identification of only a single right whale bone and 203 bowhead whale bones from at least 72 individuals indicates that the bowhead whale was likely the principal target of the hunt. These results imply that this whaling had a much greater impact (in terms of numbers of whales removed) on the bowhead whale population than on the western North Atlantic right whale population. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Balaena mysticetus; Basque; Bone; Cytochrome b; DNA; Eubalaena glacialis; Historical population size; Little ice age; Whaling","bone; cytochrome; DNA; ecological impact; human activity; Little Ice Age; mitochondrial DNA; population size; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Canada; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Strait of Belle Isle; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,,"McLeod, B.

The significance of killer whale Orcinus orca predation on baleen whales (Mysticeti) has been a topic of considerable discussion and debate in recent years. Discourse has been constrained by poor understanding of predator-prey dynamics, including the relative vulnerability of different mysticete species and age classes to killer whales and how these prey animals avoid predation. Here we provide an overview and analysis of predatory interactions between killer whales and mysticetes, with an emphasis on patterns of antipredator responses. 2. Responses of baleen whales to predatory advances and attacks by killer whales appear to fall into two distinct categories, which we term the fight and flight strategies. The fight strategy consists of active physical defence, including self-defence by single individuals, defence of calves by their mothers and coordinated defence by groups of whales. It is documented for five mysticetes: southern right whale Eubalaena australis, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and grey whale Eschrichtius robustus. The flight strategy consists of rapid (20-40 km/ h) directional swimming away from killer whales and, if overtaken and attacked, individuals do little to defend themselves. This strategy is documented for six species in the genus Balaenoptera. 3. Many aspects of the life history, behaviour and morphology of mysticetes are consistent with their antipredator strategy, and we propose that evolution of these traits has been shaped by selection for reduced predation. Fight species tend to have robust body shapes and are slow but relatively manoeuvrable swimmers. They often calve or migrate in coastal areas where proximity to shallow water provides refuge and an advantage in defence. Most fight species have either callosities (rough and hardened patches of skin) or encrustations of barnacles on their bodies, which may serve (either primarily or secondarily) as weapons or armour for defence. Flight species have streamlined body shapes for high-speed swimming and they can sustain speeds necessary to outrun pursuing killer whales (>15-20 km/h). These species tend to favour pelagic habitats and calving grounds where prolonged escape sprints from killer whales are possible. 4. The rarity of observed successful attacks by killer whales on baleen whales, especially adults, may be an indication of the effectiveness of these antipredator strategies. Baleen whales likely offer low profitability to killer whales, relative to some other marine mammal prey. High-speed pursuit of flight species has a high energetic cost and a low probability of success while attacks on fight species can involve prolonged handling times and a risk of serious injury. © Journal compilation © 2008 Mammal Society.","Cetacean; Defence; Killer whale; Orcinus orca; Predation; Predator avoidance","antipredator defense; marine mammal; morphology; pelagic environment; predation; predator-prey interaction; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Orcinus orca; Thoracica",,,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea I.

Migration behavior makes it more difficult to locate and sample marine animals systematically or to observe them opportunistically. The lack of data creates a critical gap in understanding social behavior; it also hampers the development of mitigation strategies to anthropogenic disturbances such as vessel strikes, acoustic pollution and entanglements. We employ regression analysis to fill this gap to model northerly movements of North Atlantic right whales in the coastal mid-Atlantic migratory corridor of the United States. The modeling suggests an early to mid-March departure from Jacksonville, Florida, with a 30 day departure range; an average travel time of 21-24 days to the tip of Long Island, corresponding to a mean migration/displacement rate of 1.5-1.7 knots (2.8-3.1 km/h). Right whales migrating with calves begin their northern migration several days after right whales migrating without calves. These statistical models can supplement the absence of migratory survey data and help direct and stratify survey efforts in migratory corridors. The combination of rigorous statistical prediction with direct observation also should facilitate the creation of more effective mitigation measures. The methods employed here can be applied to other megafauna elsewhere around the world in many situations where migratory data are sparse. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Most low-frequency anthropogenic noise in the ocean comes from commercial shipping which has contributed to an increase in ocean background noise over the past 150 years. The long-term impacts of these changes on marine mammals are not well understood. This paper describes both short- and long-term behavioral changes in calls produced by the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) in the presence of increased low-frequency noise. Right whales produce calls with a higher average fundamental frequency and they call at a lower rate in high noise conditions, possibly in response to masking from low-frequency noise. The long-term changes have occurred within the known lifespan of individual whales, indicating that a behavioral change, rather than selective pressure, has resulted in the observed differences. This study provides evidence of a behavioral change in sound production of right whales that is correlated with increased noise levels and indicates that right whales may shift call frequency to compensate for increased band-limited background noise. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Behavioral research; Mammals; Marine biology; Speech communication; Speech synthesis; Acoustic communication; Anthropogenic noise; Behavioral changes; Marine mammals; Acoustic intensity; acoustics; animal behavior; animal communication; article; lifespan; marine mammal; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; sound; whale; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Canada; Echolocation; Noise, Transportation; Perceptual Masking; Ships; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","The authors dedicate this paper to the memory of William Watkins, a pioneer of marine mammal bioacoustics, who provided access to the 1956 Schevill recordings from the North Atlantic.

Inputs to the model are energy availability and lipid-normalized toxicant concentration in the environment. The model predicts individual growth, reproduction, bioaccumulation, and transfer of energy and toxicant from mothers to their young. We estimated all model parameters for the right whale; with these parameters, reduction in energy availability increases the age at first parturition, increases intervals between reproductive events, reduces the organisms' ability to buffer seasonal fluctuations, and increases its susceptibility to temporal shifts in the seasonal peak of energy availability. Reduction in energy intake increases bioaccumulation and the amount of toxicant transferred from mother to each offspring. With high energy availability, the toxicant load of offspring decreases with birth order. Contrary to expectations, this ordering may be reversed with lower energy availability. Although demonstrated with parameters for the right whale, these relationships between energy intake and energetics and pharmacokinetics of organisms are likely to be much more general. Results specific to right whales include energy assimilation estimates for the North Atlantic and southern right whale, influences of history of energy availability on reproduction, and a relationship between ages at first parturition and calving intervals. Our model provides a platform for further analyses of both individual and population responses of marine mammals to pollution, and to changes in energy availability, including those likely to arise through climate change. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bioaccumulation; Dynamic energy budget (DEB) model; Energy intake and utilization; Eubalaena glacialis; Lipophilic; Marine mammal; North Atlantic right whale growth and reproduction; PCB; Toxicant transfer","bioaccumulation; bioenergetics; climate change; energy budget; food chain; lipid; marine pollution; parturition; PCB; pollutant transport; population modeling; reproduction; seasonal variation; toxic substance; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; polychlorinated biphenyl; aging; animal; article; biological model; energy metabolism; female; food chain; greenhouse effect; male; physiology; reproduction; water pollutant; whale; Aging; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Female; Food Chain; Greenhouse Effect; Male; Models, Biological; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Whales",,"Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Patterns of lipid content and stratification in the blubber of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1990) Journal of Mammalogy, 71, pp. 544-554; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Reproductive transfer and variation of body load of organochlorine pollutants with age in fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1994) Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 27, pp. 546-554; Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Pastor, T., Biological factors affecting variability of persistent pollutant levels in cetaceans (1999) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management Special Issue, 1, pp. 83-116; Angell, C., (2005) Body fat condition of right whales, Eubalaena glacialis and Eubalaena australis, , Dissertation.

K9J 7B8, Canada","Parentage analyses of baleen whales are rare, and although mating systems have been hypothesized for some species, little data on realized male reproductive success are available and the patterns of male reproductive success have remained elusive for most species. Here we combine over 20 years of photo-identification data with high-resolution genetic data for the majority of individual North Atlantic right whales to assess paternity in this endangered species. There was significant skew in male reproductive success compared to what would be expected if mating was random (P < 0.001). The difference was due to an excess of males assigned zero paternities, a deficiency of males assigned one paternity, and an excess of males assigned as fathers for multiple calves. The variance in male reproductive success was high relative to other aquatically mating marine mammals, but was low relative to mammals where the mating system is based on resource- and/or mate-defence polygyny. These results are consistent with previous data suggesting that the right whale mating system represents one of the most intense examples of sperm competition in mammals, but that sperm competition on its own does not allow for the same degree of polygyny as systems where males can control access to resources and/or mates. The age distribution of assigned fathers was significantly biased towards older males (P < 0.05), with males not obtaining their first paternity until ∼15 years of age, which is almost twice the average age of first fertilization in females (8 years), suggesting that mate competition is preventing younger males from reproducing. The uneven distribution of paternities results in a lower effective population size in this species that already has one of the lowest reported levels of genetic diversity, which may further inhibit reproductive success through mate incompatibility of genetically similar individuals. © 2007 The Authors.","Endangered species; Mating systems; Paternity; Polygyny; Reproductive success; Right whale","aging; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; classification; female; male; physiology; population density; reproduction; sexual behavior; species extinction; time; whale; Aging; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Extinction, Biological; Female; Male; Population Density; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Time Factors; Whales; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Amos, W., Balmford, A., When does conservation genetics matter?

We used a hydrodynamic model, observed Calanus finmarchicus (the preferred prey of right whales) abundance, and right whale sightings during 1997-2004 to examine the transport and retention of C. finmarchicus in MB-CCB and the implications for right whale activity. A particle-tracking program was embedded into the model to simulate the Lagrangian residual circulation, and the transport and retention of passive particles. The results indicate significant correlations in the inter-annual variability of coastal transport, circulation pattern, C. finmarchicus abundance, and right whale sightings in spring. In normal years (with prevailing northwesterly winds), the monthly mean distributions of particles and Lagrangian residual currents show a coherent pattern with 2 particle retention areas in central CCB and central MB, respectively. The CCB retention area closely matches the area of high probability of right whale occurrence and feeding activity, indicating that this is an area favorable to zooplankton aggregations. In other years (e.g. 2002), the coastal current is significantly reduced due to prevailing southwesterly winds, and the particle retention zone is shifted northward, coincident with low C. finmarchicus abundance and whale sightings in CCB. The study also suggests that the North Atlantic Oscillation may influence C. finmarchicus abundance and distributions, and hence, right whale feeding activity in CCB through surface winds affecting MB-CCB circulation, and hence, zooplankton distributions. © Inter-Research 2007.","Calanus finmarchicus; Cape Cod Bay; Circulation; Massachusetts Bay; North Atlantic Oscillation; Numerical model; Retention; Right whale","abundance; circulation; feeding behavior; foraging behavior; North Atlantic Oscillation; numerical model; population distribution; spring (season); whale; zooplankton; Cape Cod Bay; Massachusetts; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Barton, A.D., Greene, C.H., Monger, B.C., Pershing, A.J., The continuous plankton recorder survey and the North Atlantic Oscillation: Interannual- to multidecadal-scale patterns of phytoplankton variability in the North Atlantic Ocean (2003) Prog Oceanogr, 58, pp. 337-358; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C., Wishner, K.F., Macaulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Bigelow, H.B., Physical oceanography of the Gulf of Maine (1927) Bull US Bur Fish, 40 (2), pp. 511-1027; Blumberg, A.F., Mellor, G.L., A description of a three-dimensional coastal ocean circulation model (1987) Three-dimensional coastal ocean models; Coastal and estuarine sciences, 4, pp. 1-6. , Heaps NS ed, American Geophysical Union, Washington, DC, p; CETAP (Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program) (1982) A characterization of marine mammals and turtles in the Mid- and North-Atlantic areas of the US outer continental shelf, Final report.

Recent documentation of these phenomena in several species suggests that they may play a communicative role, though the exact function is still under investigation. Here, qualitative descriptions and quantitative analyses of nonlinearities in the vocalizations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are provided. All four nonlinear features were present in both species, with at least one feature occurring in 92.4% of killer and 65.7% of right whale vocalizations analyzed. Occurrence of biphonation varied the most between species, being present in 89.0% of killer whale vocalizations and only 20.4% of right whale vocalizations. Because deterministic chaos is qualitatively and quantitatively different than random or Gaussian noise, a program (TISEAN©) designed specifically to identify deterministic chaos to confirm the presence of this nonlinearity was used. All segments tested in this software indicate that both species do indeed exhibit deterministic chaos. The results of this study provide confirmation that such features are common in the vocalizations of cetacean species and lay the groundwork for future studies. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Chaos theory; Computer software; Gaussian noise (electronic); Living systems studies; Atlantic right whales; Biphonation; Nonlinear phenomena; Qualitative descriptions; Acoustic wave effects; article; Cetacea; computer program; controlled study; killer whale; noise; nonhuman; phonation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; species; vocalization; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Communication; Genetics, Population; Models, Biological; Software; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal; Whale, Killer; Whales",,,,,,,,"Cranford, T.W., Visualizing dolphin sonar signal generation using high-speed video endoscopy (1997) J.

Autonomous hydrophones recorded sound continuously from July 2004 to August 2005. Right whale contact calls (upcalls) were identified using automatic recognition software, and the resulting detections were checked manually. Substantial numbers of hours with upcalls were observed at both sites, with approximately four times as many hours with calls at the western site as the central one. Calls occurred mainly from August through October, with the earliest calls in late June and the latest at the end of December at both sites. In addition to this seasonal trend, there was a significant diel pattern in calling at the central site but not at the more westerly site. Results are analyzed in light of feeding ecology and broad-scale movements of right whales. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustic survey; Automatic detection; Eubalaena glacialis; Moored hydrophone; North Atlantic; Right whale","diel variation; movement; seasonal variation; species occurrence; vocalization; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 123-135. , and; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 155-166. , and; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 137-154. , and; Brown, M.W., Allen, J.W., Kraus, S.D., (1995) The Designation of Seasonal Right Whale Conservation Areas in the Waters of Atlantic Canada, pp. 90-98. , and.

Observations of copulations in North Atlantic right whale surface active groups (SAGs) have led to the hypothesis that the function of these groups is for conception. The occurrence and composition of SAGs sighted from 1992 to 2001 were investigated on the basis of age, sex, and reproductive status of individuals. A total of 918 SAG events were documented. SAGs were observed in all habitat areas and in all months in which right whales were sighted. Group compositions revealed both potentially conceptive groups and nonconceptive groups. Of right whales whose age was known, 93% were first sighted in SAGs as juveniles, and more than half of all observed groups contained at least one juvenile whale. The group composition and timing of occurrence of SAGs do not support the hypothesis that all groups serve a purely conceptive function. Their functional role is likely much broader. Other potential functions include play, mating practice, or maintenance of social bonds. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Baleen whale; Eubalaena glacialis; Right whale; Social behavior","community composition; functional role; group behavior; mating behavior; reproductive status; social behavior; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Seasonality of reproduction and the length of gestation in southern right whales Eubalaena australis (1994) Journal of Zoology, London, 232, pp. 175-189; Best, P.B., Schaeff, C.M., Reeb, D., Palsbøll, P.J., Composition and possible function of social groupings of southern right whales in South African waters (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 1469-1494. , and; Bortz, J., Lienert, G.A., Boehnke, K., (1990) Verteilungsfreie Methoden in der Biostatistik., , and.

The closed form representations for the detectors are derived and the detection performance is compared with that of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector. The test results demonstrate that in the presence of impulsive noise, the spectrogram-based detector using the French hat wavelet as the filter kernel outperforms the GLRT detector and decreases computational time by a factor of 6. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"FIR filters; Fish; Signal detection; Spectrographs; Statistical methods; Eubalaena glacialis; Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT); Spectrogram-based statistics; Acoustic waves; article; filter; infrared spectroscopy; kernel method; noise; priority journal; sound detection; statistical model; whale; Acoustics; Animal Communication; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biometry; Conservation of Natural Resources; Echolocation; Models, Theoretical; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","The authors wish to thank M.

Traditional behavioral or physiological techniques to test hearing are not feasible with right whales. Previous research on the hearing of marine mammals has shown that functional models are reliable estimators of hearing sensitivity in marine species. Fundamental to these models is a comprehensive analysis of inner ear anatomy. Morphometric analyses of 18 inner ears from 13 stranded North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were used for development of a preliminary model of the frequency range of hearing. Computerized tomography was used to create two-dimensional (2D) and 3D images of the cochlea. Four ears were decalcified and sectioned for histologic measurements of the basilar membrane. Basilar membrane length averaged 55.7 mm (range, 50.5 mm-61.7 mm). The ganglion cell density/mm averaged 1,842 ganglion cells/mm. The thickness/width measurements of the basilar membrane from slides resulted in an estimated hearing range of 10 Hz-22 kHz based on established marine mammal models. Additional measurements from more specimens will be necessary to develop a more robust model of the right whale hearing range. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Baleen whale; Basilar membrane; Cetacean; Cochlea; Hearing","acoustics; animal anatomy; article; auditory discrimination; basilar membrane; cochlea; computer assisted tomography; ear; Eubalaena glacialis; functional anatomy; hearing; mammal; marine environment; measurement; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; three dimensional imaging; whale; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ear, Inner; Hearing; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Biological; Sound; Whales; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Hearing in whales and dolphins: An overview (2000) Hearing by whales and dolphins, pp. 1-42. , Au WWL, Popper AN, Fay RR, editors, New York: Springer-Verlag. p; Clark, C.W., Clark, J.M., Sound playback experiments with southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) (1980) Science, 207, pp. 663-665; Cummings, W.C., Thompson, P.O., Gray whales, Eschrichtius robustus, avoid the underwater sounds of killer whales, Orcinus orca (1971) Fish Bull, 69, pp. 525-530; Echteler, S.W., Fay, R.R., Popper, A.N., Structure of the mammalian cochlea (1994) Comparative hearing: Mammals, pp. 134-171. , Popper AN, editor, New York: Springer-Verlag. p; Fay, R.R., Structure and function in sound discrimination among vertebrates (1992) The evolutionary biology of hearing, pp. 229-267. , Popper AN, editor, New York: Springer-Verlag. p; Frankel, A.S., Joseph, R., Mobley, J., Herman, L.M., Estimation of auditory response thresholds in humpback whales using biologically meaningful sounds (1995) Sensory systems of aquatic mammals.

Based on a consensus region of 275 base pairs of the mtDNA control region, 37 variable sites defined 37 unique haplotypes, of which only one was shared between regional samples of the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the southern right whale haplotypes revealed 2 distinct clades that differed significantly in frequencies between oceans. An analysis of molecular variance confirmed significant overall differentiation among the 4 calving grounds at both the haplotype and the nucleotype levels (FST = 0.159; ΦST = 0.238; P &lt; 0.001). Haplotype diversity was significantly lower in the Indo-Pacific (h = 0.701 ± 0.037) compared with the South Atlantic (h = 0.948 ± 0.013), despite a longer history of exploitation and larger catches in the South Atlantic. In fact, the haplotype diversity in the Indo-Pacific basin was similar to that of the North Atlantic right whale that currently numbers about 300 animals. Multidimensional scaling of genetic differentiation suggests that gene flow occurred primarily between adjacent calving grounds within an ocean basin, with mixing of lineages from different calving grounds occurring on feeding grounds. © The American Genetic Association. 2007.

As vessel speed restrictions are being considered to reduce the likelihood and severity of vessel collisions with right whales, we present an analysis of the published historical records of vessels striking large whales. We examine the influence of vessel speed in contributing to either a lethal injury (defined as killed or severely injured) or a nonlethal injury (defined as minor or no apparent injury) to a large whale when struck. A logistic regression model fitted to the observations, and consistent with a bootstrap model, demonstrates that the greatest rate of change in the probability of a lethal injury (Plethal) to a large whale occurs between vessel speeds of 8.6 and 15 knots where Plethal increases from 0.21 to 0.79. The probability of a lethal injury drops below 0.5 at 11.8 knots. Above 15 knots, Plethal asymptotically approaches 1. The uncertainties in the logistic regression estimates are relatively large at relatively low speeds (e.g., at 8 knots the probability is 0.17 with a 95% CI of 0.03-0.6). The results we provide can be used to assess the utility of vessel speed limits that are being considered to reduce the lethality of vessels striking the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale and other large whales that are frequent victims of vessel strikes. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Bootstrap; Lethal injury; Logistic regression; Probability; Right whale; Vessel speed; Vessel strike; Whales","bootstrapping; collision; historical record; human activity; injury; numerical model; probability; vessel; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"AGUILAR, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , W.

This is the most important collection existing in Italy for the number of taxa being included (27), seven of them being the sole present in Italian museums. Noteworthy are the skeletons of some large size species, among which the Blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus) and the Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis ) are the sole complete ones existing in Italy in addition to the adults of the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the Northern right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis). The collection must also be appreciated for several exotic species. The 53 skeletons here stored were mostly acquired during the XIX Century, thanks to prof. Sebastiano Richiardi, director of the Institute from 1871 to 1904, and increased from his successor, prof. Eugenio Ficalbi from 1905 to1922. This catalogue has been compiled throughout a long term study begun in 1984 and concluded only several years later, after the transfer of the collection to its present seat: as a matter of fact, an accurate revision of the conditions of the specimens was essential after the move and the final layout. At the same time, a wide documental research was run on the archivial historical sources, concerning the acquisition of the specimens, with many original information on the long history of the building of the collection; detailed data on the costs of several purchasing contracts are also reported. The catalogue lists each specimen in systematic order, with its taxonomic references and description of the fundamental osteometrical parameters. Specific bibliography concerning every specimen of the collection is also shown. © 2007, Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali.

These vocalizations were processed using a set of detection and localization algorithms developed as part of the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) program. Localization is performed using hyperbolic multilateration on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) data from a two stage FFT based energy detector. Binary FFTs are computed from the raw time series by thresholding the FFT using a time average in each bin as the threshold criteria. Clicks are detected by comparing the total number of bins above threshold to a secondary threshold. Detected clicks are split out of the data stream and the rest of the data is aligned using a spectrogram cross-correlation. Details of the marine mammal monitoring algorithms will be presented as well as results from the data set. ©2006 IEEE.",,"Bins; Fast Fourier transforms; Ground operations; Military operations; Time series analysis; Data sets; Eubalaena glacialis; North Atlantic; Mammals",,,,,,,,"Schevill, W.E., And Watkins, W.A., (1962) Whale and porpoise voices.

Morphometric data from whaling records and recent stranding events were compiled, and morphometric parameters describing the body length, and fluke and flipper dimensions for an ""average"" blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, gray whale Eschrichtius robustus, and right whale Eubalaena glacialis were determined. Body mass, body volume, body surface area, and fluke and flipper surface areas were estimated. The resultant morphological configurations lent themselves to the following classifications based on hydrodynamic principles: fast cruiser, slow cruiser, fast maneuverer, and slow maneuverer. Blue whales have highly stream-lined bodies with small, high aspect ratio flippers and flukes for fast efficient cruising in the open ocean. On the other hand, the rotund right whale has large, high aspect ratio flukes for efficient slow speed cruising that is optimal for their continuous filter feeding technique. Humpbacks have large, high aspect ratio flippers and a large, low aspect ratio tail for quick acceleration and high-speed maneuvering which would help them catch their elusive prey, while gray whales have large, low aspect ratio flippers and flukes for enhanced low-speed maneuvering in complex coastal water habitats. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cetacean; Feeding ecology; Functional morphology; Mysticete; Swim performance","adaptation; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; feeding behavior; histology; locomotion; physiology; predation; swimming; whale; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Locomotion; Models, Anatomic; Predatory Behavior; Swimming; Whales; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Digenea (flukes); Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; Andrews, R.C., Notes upon the external and internal anatomy of Balaena glacialis Bonn (1908) Bull Am Mus Nat Hist, 24, pp. 171-182; Andrews, R.C., Monograph of the pacific cetacean California gray whale (1914) Mem Am Mus Nat Hist, 1, pp. 229-287; Benke, H., Investigations on the osteology and functional morphology of the flipper of whales and dolphins (Cetacea) (1993) Investig Cetacea, 24, pp. 9-252; Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (SPEC.

The proposed solution is based on using a generalized likelihood ratio test detector of polynomial-phase signals with unknown amplitude and polynomial coefficients observed in the presence of locally stationary Gaussian noise. The closed form representation for a minimal sufficient statistic is derived and a realizable detection scheme is developed. The receiver operation characteristic curves are calculated using empirical data recordings containing known right whale calls. The curves demonstrate that the proposed detector provides superior detection performance as compared with other known detection techniques for northern right whale contact calls. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Contact calls; Minimal sufficient statistic; Receiver operation characteristic curves; Biodiversity; Gaussian noise (electronic); Maximum likelihood estimation; Polynomials; Acoustics; acoustics; animal communication; article; Atlantic Ocean; endangered species; nonhuman; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; signal detection; signal noise ratio; sound detection; statistical model; whale; Algorithms; Animals; Likelihood Functions; Models, Biological; Normal Distribution; ROC Curve; Vocalization, Animal; Whales",,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","The authors wish to thank M.

As with most coastal ecosystems, Cape Cod Bay is a dynamic system with a high degree of variability in both physical and biological parameters. However, the extent of these fluctuations and their effect on the suitability of the bay as a right-whale feeding ground are not known. This study was conducted to address variability in the biological and physical environment of the bay and the possible impacts of this variability on the right whales' use of the area as a feeding ground. This study synthesized data collected from January to May, in 2000 to 2003. During 2002, the whales made very limited use of the bay compared to the other 3 yr, providing a unique opportunity for comparing conditions in the bay during this change in pattern of usage by the whales. Data on the physical and biological environment of Cape Cod Bay were collected during weekly cruises. These data indicated that there was significant interannual variation in the wind-forcing affecting Cape Cod Bay. Coincident with this variation were changes in the hydrography of the bay, suggesting that circulation patterns changed during the course of the study. Circulation changes affected the zooplankton prey of the whales either directly through changes in advection, or indirectly by affecting the production of the zooplankton. © Inter-Research 2006.","Advection; Cape Cod Bay; Copepod production; Eubalaena glacialis; Hydrography; Interannual changes; Wind patterns; Zooplankton","annual variation; endangered species; environmental factor; feeding ground; habitat quality; hydrography; marine ecosystem; whale; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cape Cod Bay; Massachusetts; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Campbell, R.G., Teegarden, G.J., Durbin, E.G., Associations between North Atlantic right whales and their prey, Calanus finmarchicus, over diel and tidal time scales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 155-166; Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag Spec Issue, 2, pp. 161-170; Bigelow, H.B., Plankton of the offshore waters of the Gulf of Maine (1926) Bull Bur Fish Wash, 40, pp. 1-509; Bigelow, H.B., Physical oceanography of the Gulf of Maine (1927) Bull Bur Fish Wash, 40, pp. 511-1027; Blumberg, A., Signell, R.P., Jenter, H., Modeling transport processes in the coastal ocean (1993) J Environ Eng, 1, pp. 31-52; Brown, M.W., Nichols, O.C., Marx, M.K., Ciano, J.N., (2002) Surveillance of North Atlantic Right Whales in Cape Cod Bay and Adjacent Waters - 2002.

The highly endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) is a good model species, because most NARW individuals are photo-identified with known histories. We used an 125I corticosterone assay, shown to reliably measure cortisol metabolites, to determine glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in 177 NARW fecal samples collected between 1999-2004 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations varied significantly with sex and reproductive category, being highest in pregnant females (mean ±SE: 238.14 ± 74.37 ng/g) and mature males (71.6 ± 11.36), intermediate in lactating females (39.33 ± 5.82), and lower in non-reproducing females (23.11 ± 4.25) and immature males (34.33 ± 5.01) and females (14.0 ± 0.41). One case also suggests that glucocorticoids rise markedly in response to severe entanglement in fishing lines. Whales with fecal glucocorticoid content over 100 ng/g (termed ""high-cort"" samples) were rare, and included most pregnant females, some mature males, a fatally entangled whale, and several very young animals. Glucocorticoid concentrations were highly correlated with androgen concentrations in males and pregnant females. We analyzed the elution profiles of glucocorticoid and androgen metabolites in 13 samples with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the extent to which androgen metabolites cross-react with our glucocorticoid assay. Males, pregnant females, non-pregnant females, and ""high-cort"" whales each had distinctly different immunoreactive HPLC profiles of glucocorticoid and androgen metabolites. A major glucocorticoid metabolite was prominent in all ""high-cort"" whales including the fatally entangled whale. The major fecal androgen was not testosterone but was instead a more nonpolar steroid (possibly dihydrotestosterone), which may be diagnostic of males. Androgen metabolites showed only minor cross-reactivity to our glucocorticoid assay, having a slight influence on glucocorticoid results in particular individuals. We conclude that fecal glucocorticoid analysis appears to be a useful measure of adrenal activity and reproductive condition for NARW. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, the critique is based on a misinterpretation of the geographical, temporal, and taxonomic focus of our previous work. The source of the putative conflict appears to stem from the misinterpretation that our results, focused solely on the impact of Basque whaling in the 16th and 17th centuries on the western North Atlantic right whale, were intended to be representative of all whaling of both right and bowhead whales throughout the North Atlantic. To demonstrate this, we briefly review our original results and conclusions and show that the information reviewed by Romero and Kannada does not challenge any aspect of our original work. As such, their comment is not a critique of our paper, but rather a brief review of the history of whaling in the North Atlantic. © 2006 NRC.",,"Basque whaling; Bowhead whales; Genetic analysis; Taxonomy; Ecosystems; Genetic engineering; Population statistics; Biodiversity; genetic analysis; skeletal remains; whale; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

The NARW population consists of only about 300 individuals and is reproducing at an insufficient rate. There is growing concern about the potential effects of environmental contaminants on the reproductive and overall health of NARW. High contaminant burdens can accumulate in tissues of great whales but toxicological studies of their effects are limited due to legal, logistical and ethical restrictions and specific in vitro models are critically needed. Cell lines from NARW skin and internal organs were previously created in our laboratory. In this study, skin, testis and lung primary fibroblast cell lines were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BP) as part of a multi-chemical toxicity testing project in NARW. Cells were exposed for 24-72 h to 10 nM-10 μM BP dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. Cytotoxicity was measured with a clonogenic assay using standard methods. Some cytotoxicity was observed after 24 h, the highest concentration (10 μM BP) resulting in 77, 74 and 51 percent relative survival in testis, skin and lung cells, respectively, and indicating a higher cytotoxicity in the lung (p < 0.05). After 48 and 72-h exposure, 10 μM BP resulted in 24 and 3, 74 and 27, and 42 and 23 percent relative survival in testis, skin and lung cells, respectively. Cytotoxicity significantly increased with exposure time in all three tissues (p < 0.05 for skin and p < 0.01 for lung and testis), suggesting metabolic activation of BP in the three organs. Fibroblast cytotoxicity observed in the testis was higher than that observed either in the skin or lung after 48 h (p < 0.01) and was close to 100% after 72 h, warranting further investigation of the potential effects of PAHs on reproductive health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

During their residency in these waters, these whales are frequently observed feeding. This study evaluated spatial and temporal changes in the chemical composition (carbon weight and C/N ratio) of the food resource targeted by the right whales in Cape Cod Bay. The three taxa measured (Centropages typicus, Pseudocalanus spp., and Calanus finmarchicus) had highly variable chemical compositions resulting from the different life strategies and from fluctuations in their surrounding environment. The impact of seasonal variability in the energy densities of the food resource of right whales was calculated and compared to the energetic requirements of these whales. Calculations indicated that differences in the nutritional content of the zooplankton prey in Cape Cod Bay could have a considerable effect on the nutrition available to the right whales. Therefore, it is likely that using more precise estimates of the energetic densities of the prey of right whales would lead to a re-evaluation of the adequacy of the food resource available to these whales in the North Atlantic. © 2006 The Authors.

A line passing over the leading edge of a fluke specimen was fixed at one end while the other end was loaded in an oscillatory manner. A 24-h abrasion test using an accelerated loading rate of 60 cycles/min and a 9.0-kg load on the fixed end of the most abrasive line tested (old sink line) was used to simulate a whale swimming 2 m/s towing four standard lobster buoys for five days. A tension load of 267 N was generated on the oscillatory side of the fluke. The test line failed to break the skin on the fluke but, instead, produced a compression furrow (maximum depth 0.31 cm) that closely resembled marks found on stranded right (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. Different line types (float vs. sink) and ages of rope (new vs. old) produced furrows of varying depths and appearances. Further tests characterizing whale skin/fishing line interactions will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern entanglement injuries and provide a framework for better forensic analysis and interpretation of gear-related injuries observed in large whales. © 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Cetacean; Entanglement; Eubalaena glacialis; Humpback whale; Injury; Megaptera novaeangliae; Modeling; Right whale","fishing gear; injury; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Paralichthys dentatus; Trematoda",,,,,,,,"Barco, S.G.W.A., McLellan, J.M., Allen, R.A., Asmutis-Silvia, R., Mallon-Day, E.M., Meagher, D.A., Pabst, J., Clapham, J.P., Population identity of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the waters of the US mid-Atlantic states (2002) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 4, pp. 135-141; Caswell, H.M., Fujiwara, Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Fung, Y.C., (1981) Biomechanics.

Survey data were collected within four survey zones in and adjacent to federally designated critical habitat. These data, including whale-sighting locations and sampling effort, were used to describe right whale distribution in relation to sea-surface temperature (SST) from satellite-derived images. Locations where whales were sighted (n= 609) had an overall mean SST of 14.3°C ± 2.1°(range 8°-22°C). Data from two survey zones having sufficient data (including the ""early warning system"" (EWS) zone and the Florida nearshore) were pooled by season and stratified by month to investigate changes in monthly ambient SST and fine-scale distribution patterns of right whales in relation to SST within spatially explicit search areas. Using Monte Carlo techniques, SSTs and latitudes (means and standard deviations) of locations where whales were sighted were compared to a sampling distribution of each variable derived from daily-search areas. Overall, results support a nonrandom distribution of right whales in relation to SST: during resident months (January and February), whales exhibited low variability in observed SST and a suggested southward shift in whale distribution toward warmer SSTs in the EWS zone; while in the relatively warmer and southernmost survey zone (Florida nearshore), right whales were concentrated in the northern, cooler portion. Our results support that warm Gulf Stream waters, generally found south and east of delineated critical habitat, represent a thermal limit for right whales and play an important role in their distribution within the calving grounds. These results affirm the inclusion of SST in a multivariate predictive model for right whale distribution in their southeastern habitat. © 2006 by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.","Endangered species; Eubalaena glacialis; GIS; North Atlantic right whale; Sea-surface temperature; Southeastern U.S. calving grounds","aerial survey; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; whale; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; North America; United States; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Atkinson, L.P., Modes of Gulf Stream intrusion into the South Atlantic Bight shelf waters (1977) Geophysical Research Letters, 4, pp. 583-586; Atkinson, L.P.T.N., Lee, J.O., Blanton, Chandler, S.W., Climatology of the southeastern United States continental shelf waters (1983) Journal of Geophysical Oceanography, 88, pp. 4705-4718; Baumgartner, M.F.T.V.N., Cole, P.J., Clapham, Mate, R.B., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 264, pp. 137-154; Brodie, P.F., Cetacean energetics, an overview of intraspecific size variation (1975) Ecology, 56, pp. 152-159; Brown, C.W., Winn, E.H., Relationship between the distribution pattern of right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, and satellite-derived sea surface thermal structure in the Great South Channel (1989) Continental Shelf Research, 9, pp. 247-260; Burnell, S.R., Bryden, M.M., Coastal residence periods and reproductive timing in southern right whales, Eubalaena australis (1997) Journal of Zoology, 241, pp. 613-621; Caswell, H.M., Fujiwara, Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., The social and reproductive biology of humpback whales: An ecological perspective (1996) Mammal Review, 26, pp. 27-49; Clapham, P.J., Why do baleen whales migrate? a response to Corkeron and Connor (2001) Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 432-436; Corkeron, P.J., Connor, C.R., Why do baleen whales migrate?

The occasional occurrence of Phocoena dioptrica is confirmed. Since 1989, the most important result is the large number of sightings (n=1649) of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) beyond the Kerguelen Island plateau, in an area rarely visited by fishing boats in the past.

Among the factors identified as potentially contributing to this phenomenon, exposure to marine biotoxins associated with harmful algal blooms has received little consideration. We assessed the occurrence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins (saxitoxin [STX] analogues) in E. glacialis and in the co-occurring zooplankton assemblage dominated by Calanus finmarchicus, the primary food for this whale species in the North Atlantic. Samples of E. glacialis feces collected during August/September 2001 from at least 11 different whales in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, tested positive for PSP toxins using a receptor binding assay and were also quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, indicating concentrations as high as 0.5 μg STX equivalents g-1 of feces. Zooplankton samples collected in the Bay of Fundy during the same period contained similar levels of PSP toxins by weight using both methods. Additional data from the Bay of Fundy revealed the presence of PSP toxin-producing dinoflagellates, Alexandrium spp., immediately before and during the sampling period. Associated PSP toxin levels in shellfish from nearby Cheney Passage, New Brunswick, exceeded regulatory limits over the same time frame. These findings provide direct evidence for the occurrence of PSP toxins in E. glacialis and suggest that trophic transfer of marine algal toxins is a factor contributing to the failure of the endangered North Atlantic right whale population to recover. © Inter-Research 2006.","Alexandrium; Biotoxin trophic transfer; Calanus; Eubalaena; Harmful algal blooms; North Atlantic right whale; PSP toxins; Saxitoxin","endangered species; paralytic shellfish poisoning; toxin; whale; zooplankton; Alexandrium; algae; Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Dinophyceae; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.M., Kulis, D.M., Doucette, G.J., Gallagher, J.C., Balech, E., Biogeography of toxic dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium from the northeastern United States and Canada (1994) Mar Biol, 120, pp. 467-478; Paralytic shellfish poison.

Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.","Atlantic White-sided Dolphin; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Fin Whale; Harbour Porpoise; Humpback Whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; Minke Whale; Phocoena phocoena; White-beaked Dolphin","abundance; dolphin; porpoise; prey availability; research vessel; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; whale; Canada; Halifax; North America; Nova Scotia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Edited by W.

Images from a detailed photo-identification catalog of right whales were analyzed for the presence of skin lesions. Lesions were categorized as white lesions or blister lesions and each of those categories were further divided based on lesion morphology and location. Of 439 whales photo-analyzed between 1980 and 2002, white lesions were detected on 227 ind. (51.7%) and blister lesions were found on 76 ind. (17.3 %). The majority of white lesions (72.8 %) were detected in the Bay of Fundy where their prevalence increased dramatically during the 1990s (peaking at 40 and 41 % of all identified whales in 1997 and 1999, respectively). A correlation between whale density and white lesions in the Bay of Fundy suggested that this lesion type may have been the result of a contagious agent, though the data on mother/calf pairs did not indicate transmission from mother to calf. Blister lesions appeared at low levels throughout the population over the study period. Neither lesion category was more prevalent on males or females, nor were there any differences between adults and juveniles. One white lesion type appeared exclusively on whales that had been entangled, and whose subsequent survival was in most cases questionable. This is the first detailed analysis of skin lesions in this species. Only 1 tissue sample has been previously obtained from a lesion, and thus the histology and etiology of these lesions remain unknown. Further work is needed to explore the role of disease and environmental variables in lesion prevalence. © Inter-Research 2005.","Bay of Fundy; Cetacean; Epidermis; Eubalaena glacialis; Health; Lesions; Right whale; Skin","body condition; disease prevalence; etiology; lesion; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baker, J.K., Skin disease in wild cetaceans from British waters (1992) Aquat Mamm, 18, pp. 27-32; Beckmen, K.B., Lowenstein, L.J., Newman, J., Hill, J., Hanni, K., Gerber, J., Clinical and pathological characterization of northern elephants seal skin disease (1997) J Wildl Dis, 33, pp. 438-449; Black, F., Epidemiology of Paramyxoviridae (1991) The Paramyxoviruses, , Kingsbury DW (ed) Plenum Press, New York; Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Gaskin, D.E., White, B.N., Sexual composition and analysis of reproductive females in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, population (1994) Mar Mamm Sci, 10, pp. 253-265; Durbin, E., Teegarden, G., Campbell, R., Cembella, A., Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B., North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, exposed to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins via a zooplankton vector, Calanus finmarchicus (2002) Harmful Algae, 1, pp. 243-251; Flom, J.O., Houk, E.J., Morphologic evidence of poxvirus in 'tattoo' lesions from captive bottlenosed dolphins (1979) J Wildl Dis, 15, pp. 593-596; Gaydos, J.K., Balcomb, K.C., Osborne, R.W., Dierauf, L., Evaluating potential infectious disease threats for southern resident killer whales, Orcinus orca: A model for endangered species (2004) Biol Conserv, 177, pp. 253-262; Geraci, J.R., Hicks, B.D., St Aubin, D.J., Dolphin pox: A skin disease of cetaceans (1979) Can J Comp Med, 43, pp. 399-404; Haldiman, J.T., Tarpley, R.J., Anatomy and physiology (1993) The Bowhead Whale, Spec Publ No. 2, , Burns JJ, Montague JJ, Cowles CJ (eds) The Society for Marine Mammalogy, Lawrence; Hamilton, P.K., (2002) Associations among North Atlantic Right Whales, , MSc thesis, University of Massachusetts, Boston; Hamilton, P.K., Martin, S.M., (1999) A Catalog of Identified Right Whales from the North Atlantic: 1935-1997, , New England Aquarium, Boston; Hamilton, P.K., Knowlton, A.R., Marx, M.K., Kraus, S.D., Age structure and longevity in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and their relation to reproduction (1998) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 171, pp. 285-292; Henk, W.G., Mullan, D.L., Common epidermal lesions of the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetes (1996) Scanning Microsc, 10, pp. 905-916; Hughes-Hanks, J.M., Rickard, L.G., Panuska, C., Saucier, J.R., O'Hara, T.M., Dehn, L., Rolland, R.M., Prevalence of Cryptospondium spp. and Giardia spp. in five marine mammal species (2005) J Parasitol, 91, pp. 1225-1228; Report of the workshop on status and trends of western North Atlantic right whales (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (2 SPEC ISSUE), pp. 61-87; Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Mortality and serious injury of northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the western North Atlantic Ocean (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (2 SPEC ISSUE), pp. 193-208; Kraus, S.D., Rates and potential causes of mortality in the north Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (1990) Mar Mamm Sci, 6, pp. 278-291; Kraus, S.D., Hatch, J.J., Mating strategies in the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (2 SPEC ISSUE), pp. 237-244; Kraus, S.D., Moore, K.E., Price, C.E., Crone, M.J., Watkins, W.A., Winn, H.E., Prescott, J.H., The use of photographs to identify individual North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (1986) Rep IWC, (10 SPEC ISSUE), pp. 145-151; Kraus, S.D., Hamilton, P.K., Kenney, R.D., Knowlton, A.R., Slay, C.K., Status and trends in reproduction of the North Atlantic right whale (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, (2 SPEC ISSUE), pp. 231-236; Malik, S., Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., White, B.N., Analysis of mitochondrial DNA diversity within and between North and South Atlantic right whales (2000) Mar Mamm Sci, 16, pp. 545-558; Moore, M.J., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., McLellan, W.A., Bonde, R.K., Morphometry, gross morphology and available histopathology in North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) mortalities (1970-2002) (2005) J Cetacean Res Manage, 6, pp. 199-214; Morison, W.L., Effects of ultraviolet radiation on the immune system in humans (1989) Photochem Photobiol, 50, pp. 515-524; Paterson, S., Wilson, K., Pemberton, J.M., Major histocompatibility complex variation associated with juvenile survival and parasite resistance in a large unmanaged ungulate population (Ovis aries L.)

Although these parasites have been extensively studied in terrestrial ecosystems, little is known about either parasite in the marine environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of both Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. in 5 marine mammal species. Fecal samples were collected from 39 bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), 49 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), 31 ringed seals (Phoca hispida), 22 bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), and 18 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) between 1998 and 2003. Using an immunofluorescent assay, parasites were detected in the feces of bowhead whales, right whales, and ringed seals, while neither parasite was detected in samples from bearded seals or beluga whales. Overall, prevalences were highest in ringed seals (Cryptosporidium spp., 22.6%; Giardia spp., 64.5%) and right whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 24.5%; Giardia spp., 71.4%) and lowest in bowhead whales (Cryptosporidium spp., 5.1%; Giardia spp., 33.3%).

We used sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI gene to ask (i) whether cyamid population structures might reveal associations among right whale individuals and subpopulations, (ii) whether the divergences of the three nominally conspecific cyamid species on North Atlantic, North Pacific, and southern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis, Eubalaena japonica, Eubalaena australis) might indicate their times of separation, and (iii) whether the shapes of cyamid gene trees might contain information about changes in the population sizes of right whales. We found high levels of nucleotide diversity but almost no population structure within oceans, indicating large effective population sizes and high rates of transfer between whales and subpopulations. North Atlantic and Southern Ocean populations of all three species are reciprocally monophyletic, and North Pacific C. erraticus is well separated from North Atlantic and southern C. erraticus. Mitochondrial clock calibrations suggest that these divergences occurred around 6 million years ago (Ma), and that the Eubalaena mitochondrial clock is very slow. North Pacific C. ovalis forms a clade inside the southern C. ovalis gene tree, implying that at least one right whale has crossed the equator in the Pacific Ocean within the last 1-2 million years (Myr). Low-frequency polymorphisms are more common than expected under neutrality for populations of constant size, but there is no obvious signal of rapid, interspecifically congruent expansion of the kind that would be expected if North Atlantic or southern right whales had experienced a prolonged population bottleneck within the last 0.5 Myr. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cyamus;

Focal species warrant conservation attention because they serve keystone, umbrella, indicator or flagship functions, and/or are sensitive or vulnerable to threats. 2. Defining critical habitat requirements for viable populations of focal species could provide important information for marine protected area (MPA) network design, as a complement to other considerations such as habitat representation. 3. A generally applicable approach for selecting focal species based on 20 characteristics that identify species as important in the community and/or susceptible to threats is presented with reference to the Scotia-Fundy region of Atlantic Canada. 4. Although a rigorous quantitative assessment of all local species against these characteristics is not included, several potential focal species are shown to possess many of the characteristics. 5. The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) demonstrates flagship, umbrella and indicator characteristics, and is locally vulnerable to threats. Seasonally important feeding, nursery and socializing areas could be protected within a network of MPAs in the Scotia-Fundy region, which would concurrently protect sympatric species with smaller area requirements. 6. Cold-water corals (i.e. Primnoa resedaeformis, Paragorgia arborea, Lophelia pertusa) possess keystone, indicator and flagship characteristics and are sensitive and vulnerable to local threats; thus, areas of high coral density and/or diversity could be protected within an MPA network, which would also help protect associated species. 7. These examples illustrate how consideration of the characteristics can help identify focal species and how their life requisites may be applied to MPA network design. 8. Rigorous quantitative assessment of all local species is required to select a comprehensive suite of focal species, and further research is needed to fill data gaps and confirm underlying hypotheses. 9. Nonetheless, focal species considerations show promise as a complement to other approaches to MPA network design and thus warrant further exploration in the Scotia-Fundy region and elsewhere.

Recordings were made from 52 SAGs in the Bay of Fundy, Canada between July and September, from 1999 to 2002. The call types recorded from these groups were similar to those described previously for Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), with six major call types being termed scream, gunshot, blow, upcall, warble, and downcall. The percentage of total calls of each call type depended on the group size and composition. The most common call type recorded was the scream call. The scream calls were produced by the focal female in a SAG. Production of other sound types can be attributed to whales other than the focal female, with gunshot and upcalls produced by males, and warble calls produced by female calves. The source levels for these sounds range from 137 to 162 dB rms re 1 μPa-m for tonal calls and 174 to 192 dB rms for broadband gunshot sounds. © 2005 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Behavioral research; Ecosystems; Ocean habitats; Spectrum analysis; Call types; Eubalaena glacialis; Sound production; Surface activity group (SAG); Acoustic waves; acoustics; animal behavior; article; Eubalaena glacialis; hearing; measurement; nonhuman; priority journal; social behavior; sound; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Male; Social Behavior; Sound; Sound Spectrography; Videotape Recording; Whales",,,,,,,,"Clark, C.W., The acoustic repertoire of the southern right whale, a quantitative analysis (1982) Anim.

Monte Carlo tests were used to examine the distribution of the tagged whales in space and time and with respect to a variety of environmental variables to characterize right whale habitat on their northern feeding grounds. These environmental variables included depth, depth gradient, climatological surface and bottom hydrographic properties, and remotely sensed surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and their respective horizontal gradients. Site fidelity in the Bay of Fundy was very low during 1989-1991 and high during 2000. When the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundances of their primary copepod prey, Calanus finmarchicus, are thought to be high. Instead, right whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification. No evidence was found that the tagged right whales associated with oceanic fronts or regions with high standing stocks of phytoplankton. © 2005 NRC Canada.",,"biotelemetry; habitat use; movement; population distribution; site fidelity; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; oceanic regions; World; Animalia; Balaenidae; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Baith, K., Lindsay, R., Fu, G., McClain, C.R., SeaDAS: Data analysis system developed for ocean color satellite sensors (2001) EOS Trans.

This sound has been recorded in the Bay of Fundy, Canada from both single whales (n = 9) and social surface active groups (n = 49). Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n = 9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Acoustics; Bay of Fundy; Communication; Eubalaena glacialis; Gunshot sound; Male advertisement; Right whale; Surface active group","bioacoustics; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; oceanic regions; World; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., Frankel, A.S., Helweg, D.A., Cato, D.H., Against the humpback whale sonar hypothesis (2001) I.E.E.E.

Little is known about right whale reproductive physiology, and investigating this reproductive decline has been limited by a lack of non-lethal methods for assessing reproductive status (e.g., sexual maturation, ovarian activity, pregnancy, lactation, and reproductive senescence) in free-swimming whales. This paper describes validation of existing radioimmunoassay techniques to study reproduction in right whales by measuring estrogens, progestins, androgens, and their related metabolites in fecal samples. Over the past decade fecal steroid hormone assays have been used to assess reproductive status and function in a wide range of terrestrial wildlife species, but this is the first application of this methodology in wild cetaceans. Analysis of fecal hormone metabolite levels in combination with life history data from photographically identified whales shows that this non-invasive method can be used to determine gender, detect pregnancy and lactation, and to assess age at sexual maturity in right whales and potentially other endangered whale populations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Entanglements in the western North Atlantic are a major source of injury and mortality for endangered large whales. In this study, entanglements of 31 right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 30 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were analyzed to determine the types and parts of gear involved. When gear was identified, 89% (n = 32) of the entanglements were attributed to pot and gill net gear; however, a wide range of specific gear types were implicated. Despite gear recovery, gear type was not identified in 20% (n = 9) of the cases. Although pot gear was recovered from both species equally, gill net gear was less frequently retrieved from right whales (n = 2) than humpback whales (n = 11). When gear part was identified, 81% (n = 21) involved entanglements in buoy line and/or groundline. For right whales, the most common point of gear attachment was the mouth (77.4%); for humpback whales, the tail (53%) and the mouth (43%) were common attachment sites. Four right and three humpback whales in this sample were known to have died subsequent to entanglement. However, when identified, the gear types and parts involved in lethal cases were not substantially different from entanglements with non-lethal outcomes. Large whales can become entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear types and parts, and additional insight will depend on continued efforts to document entanglements and recover associated gear. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Bycatch; Entanglement; Entanglement risk; Eubalaena glacialis; Fisheries; Gear type; Humpback whale; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mortality; North Atlantic right whale","bycatch; fishing gear; fishing mortality; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Clapham, P.J., A new birth interval approach to estimating demographic parameters of humpback whales (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 535-546; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., Wetmore, S.E., Smith, T.D., Mead, J.G., Length at birth and at independence in humpback whales (1999) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 1, pp. 141-146; Clapham, P.J., Barlow, J., Bessinger, M., Cole, T., Mattila, D., Pace, R., Palka, D., Seton, R., Abundance and demographic parameters of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine, and stock definition relative to the Scotian Shelf (2003) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 5, pp. 13-22; Report of the Workshop on the Comprehensive Assessment of Right Whales Worldwide (1999) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 1 (SUPPL.), pp. 119-120; Report of the Workshop on Status and Trends of Western North Atlantic Right Whales (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 61-87; Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Mortality and serious injury of northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the western North Atlantic Ocean (2001) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue), 2, pp. 193-208; Pettis, H.M., Rolland, R.M., Hamilton, P.K., Brault, S., Knowlton, A.R., Kraus, S.D., Visual health assessment of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) using photographs (2004) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 82, pp. 8-19; Read, A.J., Wade, P.R., Status of marine mammals in the United States (2000) Conservation Biology, 14, pp. 929-940; Reeves, R.R., Smith, B.D., Crespo, E., Notarbartolo Di Sciara, G., (2003) Dolphins, Whales, and Porpoises: 2003-2010 Conservation Action Plan for the World's Cetaceans, 147p. , Species Survival Commission, IUCN, Gland, Switzerland; Waring, G.T., Pace, R.M., Quintal, J.M., Fairfield, C.P., Maze-Foley, K., U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico marine mammal stock assessments - 2003 (2003) NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-182, 287p. , U.S. Department of Commerce","Johnson, A.; National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Region, Protected Resources Division, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930, United States; email: amanda.johnson@noaa.gov",,,"Society for Marine Mammology",,,,,08240469,,MMSCE,,"English","Mari.

Some observers have speculated that cetaceans serve as hosts for these fish based on scars, but few lamprey - cetacean interactions have been described in detail in the literature. Here we discuss 35 previously unreported records of sea lampreys that were observed while attached to western North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, during the period 1984 - 2002. Of these observations, 11 were photographically documented with images of sufficient quality to identify the lamprey as P. marinus based on morphological characteristics. The majority of the attachments were recorded in the Bay of Fundy during the summer months when P. marinus are preparing to spawn. It is unknown how lampreys might benefit from this association or what cost may be incurred by their right whale hosts. Feeding and transport are two possible reasons for the attachments.","attachment; cetacean; distribution; ectoparasite; host","ectoparasite; fish; host-parasite interaction; spatial distribution; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; oceanic regions; World; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Petromyzon marinus; Petromyzontidae; sea lampreys",,,,,,,,"Beamish, F.W.H., Biology of the North American sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus (1980) Can.

Only when survival estimates are included in a demographic model are their population implications apparent. Survival describes the transition between living and dead. Biologically important as this transition is, it is only one of many transitions in the life cycle. Others include transitions between immature and mature, unmated and mated, breeding and non-breeding, larva and adult, small and large, and location x and location y. The demographic consequences of these transitions can be captured by matrix population models, and such models provide a natural link connecting multi-stage mark-recapture methods and population dynamics. This paper explores some of those connections, with examples taken from an ongoing analysis of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Formulating problems in terms of a matrix population model provides an easy way to compute the likelihood of capture histories. It extends the list of demographic parameters for which maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained to include population growth rate, the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate, the net reproductive rate, generation time, measures of transient dynamics. In the future, multi-stage mark-recapture methods, linked to matrix population models, will become an increasingly important part of demography. © 2004 Museu de Ciències Naturals.","Elasticity; Eubalaena glacialis; Matrix population models; Right whale; Sensitivity","population estimation; survival; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); oceanic regions; World; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Arnason, A., The estimation of population size, migration rates, and survival in a stratified population (1973) Researches in Population Ecology, 15, pp. 1-8; Besbeas, P., Freeman, S.N., Morgan, B.J.T., Catchpole, E.A., Integrating mark-recapture-recovery and census data to estimate animal abundance and demographic parameters (2002) Biometrics, 58, pp. 540-547; Besbeas, P., Lebreton, J.-D., Morgan, B.J.T., The efficient integration of abundance and demographic data (2003) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society C, 52, pp. 95-102; Brownie, C., Hines, J.E., Nichols, J.D., Pollock, K.H., Hestbeck, J.B., Capture-recapture studies for multiple strata including non-Markovian transitions (1993) Biometrics, 49, pp. 1173-1187; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York, New York, U.S.A; Caswell, H., A general formula for the sensitivity of population growth rate to changes in life history parameters (1978) Theoretical Population Biology, 14, pp. 215-230; Caswell, H., (1989) Matrix Population Models, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts, U.S.A; Caswell, H., Methods of matrix population analysis (1997) Structured Population Models in Marine, Terrestrial and Freshwater Systems, pp. 19-58. , (S.

Two main areas of offshore occurrence have been known or suspected, based largely on evidence from 19th century American whaling logbooks: the Cape Farewell Ground east and south-east of the southern tip of Greenland, and 'Maury's Smear', a mid-latitude area bounded by 35 to 43° N and 25 to 48° W. While the modern occurrence of whales on the old Cape Farewell Ground has been demonstrated by recent sightings, this is not the case for Maury's Smear. Moreover, by examination of original sources we provide direct evidence that the offshore distribution illustrated by Maury in 1852 and 1853 was at least partly and possibly entirely erroneous, based on faulty data extraction and transcription procedures. Our results cast doubt on Maury's charts of 19th century whale distribution more generally, leading us specifically to question the reliability of his depictions of right whale occurrence in offshore portions of other ocean basins.","Distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; Matthew Fontaine Maury; North Atlantic Ocean; North Atlantic right whale","documentary source; geographical distribution; historical ecology; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); oceanic regions; World; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep Int Whal Comm (Spec Issue), 10, pp. 191-199; Bannister, J., Mitchell, E., North Pacific sperm whale stock identity: Distributional evidence from Maury and Townsend charts (1980) Rep Int Whal Comm (Spec Issue), 2, pp. 219-230; Brown, M.W., Brault, S., Hamilton, P.K., Kenney, R.D., Sighting heterogeneity of right whales in the western North Atlantic: 1980-1992 (2001) J Cetacean Res Manag (Spec Issue), 2, pp. 245-260; Brown, S.G., Twentieth-century records of right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the northeast Atlantic Ocean (1986) Rep Int Whal Comm (Spec Issue), 10, pp. 121-127; Chatwin, D., The whale charts produced by Matthew Fontaine Maury.

K9J 7B8, Canada","The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis (Müller, 1776), is one of the world's most endangered large cetaceans. It is widely believed that Basque whalers caused the most dramatic decline of this species in the western North Atlantic during the early-16th and 17th centuries. Previous osteological analysis of 17 historic bones suggested that 50% of the Basque harvest consisted of right whales and 50% of bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus L., 1758. This 50:50 ratio has been used to estimate pre-exploitation population size, which has subsequently formed the basis of recovery goals and plans for the North Atlantic right whale. Genetic analysis of 21 bones, 13 identified as right whales and 8 as bowhead whales through osteological examination, indicates that in fact only 1 bone was a right whale and 20 were bowhead whales. Additionally, preliminary microsatellite analyses of this specimen are not consistent with the hypothesis that whaling resulted in the low genetic variation found in this species today. These results differ from what would be expected based on any previous view of Basque whaling, and raise questions regarding the impact of Basque whaling on this species. © 2004 NRC Canada.",,"Bone; Fisheries; Genes; Genetic engineering; Population statistics; Satellite communication systems; Cetaceans; Population size; Whalers; Whaling; Marine biology; genetic analysis; genetic variation; historical ecology; identification method; whaling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); oceanic regions; World; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep.

The overall distribution of these small, migratory populations is not well known, especially outside of summer. Passive acoustic monitoring is a tool that could provide information on locations of whales. Better distributional information will inform management efforts to reduce anthropogenic mortalities caused by both ship strikes and fisheries interactions. Recent research on passive acoustic monitoring is summarised, focusing on developments relevant to detection and classification of right whale calls. Some outstanding research requirements are outlined, including the need for the development of models to investigate the potential for risk reduction from acoustic data. Buoys capable of fully automatic whale vocalisation detection, classification and transmission to shore are currently under development.",,"Algorithms; Coastal zones; Data recording; Fisheries; Information analysis; Marine biology; Probability; Real time systems; Risk assessment; Ships; Underwater acoustics; Monitoring systems; Passive acoustic methods; Real-time detection systems; Risk reduction; Biodiversity",,,,,,,,"Brownell, R.L., Conservation status of North Pacific right whales (2001) J.

Using the fundamentally non-Gaussian nature of marine mammal vocalizations and data collected on multiple hydrophones, we are able to separate right whale source spectra, up to an unknown scale, from ambient noise. This technique assumes that the array data is a linear combination of non-Gaussian source signals but does not require specific knowledge of the array geometry. A detection algorithm which separates right whale vocalizations from ambient background using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is presented and tested on data collected in the Bay of Fundy. The performance of the detector was found to be such that it was possible to achieve a probability of detection of about three-fourths with a false alarm probability of about one-third. Independent component analysis was found to provide little improvement over standard principle component analysis, which was used as preprocessing step.",,"Acoustic automated detection; Multiple sound sources; Non-Gaussian signals; Vocalization; Algorithms; Automation; Data acquisition; Fish detectors; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hydrophones; Independent component analysis; Parameter estimation; Probability; Problem solving; Real time systems; Submarines; Marine biology",,,,,,,,"Perry, S.L., Demaster, D.P., Silber, G.K., Special issue: The great whales: History and status of six species listed as endangered under the U.S. endangered species act of 1973 (1999) Marine Fisheries Review, 61, pp. 1-74; Laist, D.W., Knowlton, A.R., Mead, J.G., Colliet, A.S., Podesta, M., Collisions between ships and whales Marine Mammal Science, 17, pp. 35-75; Hyvärinen, A., Karhurien, J., Oja, E., (2001) Independent Component Analysis, , J.

This call is one of the most common sounds, and frequently the most common sound, received from right whales, and as such is a useful indicator of the presence of right whales for acoustic surveys. A data set was prepared of 1857 calls and 6359 non-call sounds recorded from North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) near Georgia and Massachusetts. Two methods for the detection of the calls were compared: spectrogram correlation and a neural network. Spectrogram correlation parameters were chosen two ways, by manual choice using a sample of 20 calls, and by an optimization procedure that used all available calls. Neural network weights were trained via backpropagation on 9/10 of the test data set. Performance was measured separately for calls of different signal-to-noise ratio, as SNR heavily influences the performance of any detector. Results showed that the neural network performed best at this task, achieving an error rate of less than 6%, and is thus the preferred detection method here. Spectrogram correlation may be useful in situations in which a large set of training data is not available, as manual training on a small set of examples achieved an error rate (26%) that may be acceptable for many applications.",,"Error rate; Manual training; Spectrogram correlation; Spectrograms; Conservation; Error analysis; Frequency modulation; Hydrophones; Marine biology; Neural networks; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Personnel training; Real time systems; Signal to noise ratio; Fish detectors",,,,,,,,"Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell Jr., R.L., Baleen whales: Conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mamm.

To assess risk factors involved in ship strikes, we used a multi-sensor acoustic recording tag to measure the responses of whales to passing ships and experimentally tested their responses to controlled sound exposures, which included recordings of ship noise, the social sounds of conspecifics and a signal designed to alert the whales. The whales reacted strongly to the alert signal, they reacted mildly to the social sounds of conspecifics, but they showed no such responses to the sounds of approaching vessels as well as actual vessels. Whales responded to the alert by swimming strongly to the surface, a response likely to increase rather than decrease the risk of collision.","Controlled exposure experiment; Eubalaena gladalis; Ship-strike","auditory cue; behavioral response; conservation; mortality; shipping; whale; alertness; animal experiment; article; auditory response; controlled study; eubalaena glacialis; exposure; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; recording; risk factor; sensor; ship; sound; stimulus response; surface property; swimming; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Brandao, A., Butterworth, D.S., Demographic parameters of southern right whales off South Africa (2001) J.

However, recent modeling studies have shown that the population's growth rate increased gradually during the 1980s, but began declining in the early 1990s, when female mortality rates increased substantially. Demographic projections predict that, assuming birth and mortality rates remain comparable to those observed in the early 1990s, the population will become extinct in less than 200 years. Further extrapolations suggest that reducing mortality rates by a few female deaths per year through conservation efforts would be sufficient to support a slow recovery of the population. However, the effects of climate variability and change on calving rates may make the North Atlantic right whale even more vulnerable than previous projections have suggested. Failure to incorporate the effects of climate in demographic projections may lead us to underestimate the conservation efforts required to ensure recovery of this whale population. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 10, pp. 191-199. , (Spec Iss); Allen, J.A., The North Atlantic right whale and its near allies (1908) B Am Mus Nat Hist, 24, pp. 277-329; Best, P.B., Bannister, J.L., Brownell, R.L., Donovan, G.P., Right whales: Worldwide status (2001) J Cetac Res Manag, 2. , (Spec Iss); Boyce, M.S., Population viability analysis (1992) Ann Rev Ecol Syst, 23, pp. 481-506; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Nat Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Cook, E.R., Multi-proxy reconstructions of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index: A critical review and a new well-verified winter NAO Index reconstruction back to AD 1400 (2003) The North Atlantic Oscillation: Climatic Significance and Environ-mental Impact, pp. 63-79. , Hurrell JW, Kushnir Y, Ottersen G, and Visbeck M (Eds) Washington DC: American Geophysical Union; Drinkwater, K.F., Belgrano, A., Borja, A., The response of marine ecosystems to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (2003) The North Atlantic Oscillation: Climatic Significance and Environmental Impact, pp. 211-234. , Hurrell J W, Kushnir Y, Ottersen G, and Visbeck M (Eds) Washington DC: American Geophysical Union; Fujiwara, M., Caswell, H., Demography of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 537-541; Gillett, N.P., Graf, H.F., Osborn, T.J., Climate change and the North Atlantic Oscillation (2003) The North Atlantic Oscillation: Climatic Significance and Environmental Impact, pp. 193-209. , Hurrell J W, Kushnir Y, Ottersen G, and Visbeck M (Eds) Washington DC: American Geophysical Union; Greene, C.H., Pershing, A.J., The response of Calanus fin-marchicus populations to climate variability in the Northwest Atlantic: Basin-scale forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (2000) ICES J Mar Sci, 57, pp. 1536-1544; Greene, C.H., Pershing, A.J., The flip-side of the North Atlantic Oscillation and modal shifts in slope water circulation patterns (2003) Limnol Oceanogr, 48, pp. 319-322; Greene, C.H., Pershing, A.J., Kenney, R.D., Jossi, J.W., Impact of climate variability on the recovery of endangered North Atlantic right whales (2003) Oceanography, 16, pp. 96-101; Hillaire-Marcel, C., De Vernal, A., Bilodeau, G., Weaver, A.J., Absence of deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea during the last interglacial period (2001) Nature, 410, pp. 1073-1077; Hurrell, J.W., Decadal trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional temperatures and precipitation (1995) Science, 269, pp. 676-679; Hurrell, J.W., Kushnir, Y., Visbeck, M., The North Atlantic Oscillation (2001) Science, 291, pp. 603-605; Hurrell, J.W., Kushnir, Y., Ottersen, G., Visbeck, M., An overview of the North Atlantic Oscillation (2003) The North Atlantic Oscillation: Climatic Significance and Environmental Impact, pp. 1-35. , Hurrell J W, Kushnir Y, Ottersen G, and Visbeck M (Eds) Washington DC: American Geophysical Union; (2001) Climate Change 2000: The Science of Climate Change.

Here, we describe a technique for assessing health based on evaluation of selected physical parameters from archived photographs of right whales. A scoring system was developed to assess body and skin condition, blow-hole cyamids, and rake marks in over 200 000 photographs. Comparison of body condition scores of females during calving and noncalving years found that females were significantly thinner in calving years and in the year after calving compared with the year before calving, showing that changes in body condition known to occur during the reproductive cycle can be successfully evaluated from photographs. Comparison of scores for all parameters between living whales and whales with more than a 5-year gap in sighting history (""presumed dead"") found that presumed dead whales received health assessment scores indicating compromised health with body condition emerging as a key visual indicator. This health assessment method provides a new tool to monitor health trends in right whales at individual and population levels and may provide a model for assessments of other well-photographed cetaceans.",,"Biology; Biomarkers; Photography; Body conditions; Visual health assessment; Health; body condition; health status; photography; visual analysis; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Cetacea; Cyamida; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Beck, G.G., Smith, T.G., Hammill, M.O., Evaluation of body condition in the Northwest Atlantic harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) (1993) Can.

The vertical distribution of C. finmarchicus was measured at V2 h intervals with an optical plankton counter (OPC) and at 6 or 12 h intervals with a MOCNESS. Right whale abundance was estimated from periodic point scans. Late-stage C. finmarchicus exhibited diel vertical migration in the upper 100 m of the water column, but the bulk of the population remained at depths below 100 m throughout both the day and night and was likely in diapause. Diel vertical migration is unlikely to be influenced by right whales, but may instead be motivated by abundant, near-surface food resources and avoidance of visual predators. Right whale sighting rate was correlated with OPC-detected C. finmarchicus fifth copepodite (C5) abundance at mid-depths (90-140 m); variability in both right whale sighting rate and C. finmarchicus C5 abundance in this depth stratum appeared to have similar periodicity to that of the tide. Energetic considerations suggest that right whales continue to feed on deep, diapausing layers of C. finmarchicus during the night, but the occasional presence of exploitable near-surface concentrations of C. finmarchicus suggests that nighttime near-surface feeding might sometimes occur.","Bay of Fundy; Calanus finmarchicus; Diel vertical migration; Eubalaena glacialis; Gulf of maine; Optical plankton counter; Right whale; Tides","abundance; diel migration; predator-prey interaction; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; vertical distribution; whale; Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Copepoda; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Båmstedt, U., Karlson, K., Euphausiid predation on copepods in coastal waters of the Northeast Atlantic (1998) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 172, pp. 149-168; Baumgartner, M.F., Comparisons of Calanus finmarchicus fifth copepodite abundance estimates from nets and an optical plankton counter (2003) J Plankton Res, 25, pp. 855-868; Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summertime foraging ecology of North Atlantic right whales (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 123-135; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C., Wishner, K.F., Macaulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Bollens, S.M., Frost, B.W., Zooplanktivorous fish and variable diel vertical migration in the marine planktonic copepod Calanus pacificus (1989) Limnol Oceanogr, 34, pp. 1072-1083; Bollens, S.M., Frost, B.W., Thoreson, D.S., Watts, S.J., Diel vertical migration in zooplankton: Field evidence in support of the predator avoidance hypothesis (1992) Hydrobiologia, 234, pp. 33-39; Bowditch, N., (1995) The American Practical Navigator, , Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Bethesda, MD; Brown, R.G.B., Gaskin, D.E., The pelagic ecology of the grey and red-necked phalaropes Phalaropus fulicarius and P. lobatus in the Bay of Fundy, eastern Canada (1988) Ibis, 130, pp. 234-250; Campbell, R.G., Runge, J.A., Durbin, E.G., Evidence for food limitation of Calanus finmarchicus production rates on the southern flank of Georges Bank during April 1997 (2001) Deep-Sea Res II, 48, pp. 531-549; Dagg, M.J., The effects of food limitation on diel migratory behavior in marine zooplankton (1985) Arch Hydrobiol Beih Ergebn Limnol, 21, pp. 247-255; Dagg, M.J., Vertical migration and feeding behavior of Calanus pacificus females during a phytoplankton bloom in Dabob Bay, U.S. (1997) Limnol Oceanogr, 42, pp. 974-980; Dagg, M.J., Frost, B.W., Walser Jr., W.E., Copepod diel migration, feeding, and the vertical flux of pheopigments (1989) Limnol Oceanogr, 34, pp. 1062-1071; Dale, T., Bagøien, E., Melle, W., Kaartvedt, S., Can predator avoidance explain varying overwintering depth of Calanus in different oceanic water masses?

Sightings of right whales were recorded along predetermined transects through each region, while both in situ and remotely sensed oceanographic measurements were collected. Sampling with plankton nets and an optical plankton counter confirmed that right whales in these regions feed on Calanus finmarchicus copepodite stage 5 (C5). Spatial variability in right whale occurrence was associated with water depth and the depth of the bottom mixed layer. C. finmarchicus C5 aggregated over the deepest water depths in both regions, and within these areas, right whales occurred where the bottom mixed layer forced discrete layers of C. finmarchicus C5 to occur shallower in the water column (allowing more efficient foraging). Annual increases in right whale occurrence appeared to be associated with decreases in sea surface temperature (SST) in both regions; however, this observation merits caution in light of the short duration of the study (3 yr). There was also evidence to suggest that both spatial and interannual variability in right whale occurrence in Roseway Basin may be associated with SST gradient, a proxy for ocean fronts.","AVHRR; Calanus finmarchicus; Distribution; Eubalaena glacialis; Fronts; Gulf of Maine; Habitat; Optical plankton counter; Roseway Basin; SeaWiFS","food availability; remote sensing; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Scotia Shelf; Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Copepoda; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Aikman III, F., Mellor, G.L., Ezer, T., Sheinin, D., Chen, P., Breaker, L., Bosley, K., Rao, D.B., Towards an operational nowcast/forecast system for the U.S. East Coast (1996) Modern Approaches to Data Assimilation in Ocean Modeling.

Simultaneous observations of temperature, salinity and the vertical distribution of their principal prey, Calanus finmarchicus stage 5 copepodites (C5), were obtained along each whale's track with a conductivity-temperature-depth instrument (CTD) and an optical plankton counter (OPC). Right whale feeding dives were characterized by rapid descent from the surface to a particular depth between 80 and 175 m, remarkable fidelity to that depth for 5 to 14 min and then rapid ascent back to the surface. The average depth of dive was strongly and positively correlated with both the average depth of peak C. finmarchicus C5 abundance and the average depth of the bottom mixed layer's upper surface. Significantly longer surface intervals were observed for reproductively active females and their calves when compared to other individuals, indicating that this critical segment of the population may be at increased risk of ship strikes owing to their diving behavior. Ingestion rates calculated from TDR and OPC data exceeded estimated daily metabolic requirements for most of the tagged right whales; however, short deployment durations and uncertainty in metabolic rates make it impossible to judge whether individual right whales were obtaining sufficient energy to meet the metabolic costs of reproduction. Improvements in attachment durations and the development of novel methods to estimate the metabolic rates of large whales in situ are required to determine whether right whale reproduction is limited by insufficient food resources.","Aggregation; Calanus finmarchicus; Diving behavior; Energetics; Eubalaena glacialis; Right whale","bioenergetics; diving behavior; foraging behavior; ingestion rate; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Balaenidae; Calanus; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Copepoda; Eubalaena; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Comparisons of Calanus finmarchicus fifth copepodite abundance estimates from nets and an optical plankton counter (2003) J Plankton Res, 25, pp. 855-868; Beardsley, R.C., Epstein, A.W., Chen, C., Wishner, K.F., Macaulay, M.C., Kenney, R.D., Spatial variability in zooplankton abundance near feeding right whales in the Great South Channel (1996) Deep-Sea Res II, 43, pp. 1601-1625; Brown, M.W., Brault, S., Hamilton, P.K., Kenney, R.D., Sighting heterogeneity of right whales in the western North Atlantic: 1980-1992 (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage Spec Issue, 2, pp. 245-250; Castellini, M.A., Kooyman, G.L., Ponganis, P.J., Metabolic rates of freely diving Weddell seals: Correlations with oxygen stores, swim velocity and diving duration (1992) J Exp Biol, 165, pp. 181-194; Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 3308-3313; Clapham, P.J., Young, S.B., Brownell Jr., R.L., Baleen whales: Conservation issues and the status of the most endangered populations (1999) Mamm Rev, 29, pp. 35-60; Comita, G.W., Marshall, S.M., Orr, A.P., On the biology of Calanus finmarchicus.

Sounds were typically (82%, n = 45) in the 300- to 600-Hz range with up- and downsweeping modulations. Lower (&lt;200 Hz) and higher (&gt;900 Hz) frequency sounds were relatively rare. Most sounds were frequency modulated, with 95% of the observed instantaneous relative frequency variation being within ±4.5% of the mean peak frequency. Harmonics were observed in 18% of the sounds. The average sound duration was 0.42 s ±0.26 SD. The sounds occurred at a rate of between 0.3 and 0.7 min-1. The time intervals between adjacent sounds (2-700 s) were not randomly distributed. The number of sounds occurring among different waiting times did not reflect a Poisson distribution and a clustering of sounds (2 to 5 cluster-1) was observed.

This review of the last decade of sightings highlights northerly movements into temperate and sub-tropical waters, indicates that fatal entanglement has occurred and points toward an increasing likelihood of interactions between migrating whales and inshore marine development. Given that entanglements and vessel strike are preventing the recovery of North Atlantic Right Whales Eubalaena glacialis, we recommend a precautionary approach to risk assessment around Australia and the formation of a national animal entanglement committee with both a pre-emptive role in assessing coastal development applications and a reactive role in the event of entanglement.","Aquaculture; Entanglement; Eubalaena australis; Recovery; Risk assessment; Sightings; Southern Right Whale","aquaculture; conservation management; risk assessment; whale; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"(1999) Sydney Harbour's Whale May Be the First of Many, , http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s46323.htm, Australian Broadcasting Commission, The 7.30 Report.

The three-hour deployment on a single day provided two-dimensional localization of 94 right whale sounds based on arrival time differences determined from spectrogram cross-correlation analysis. The sounds were of two distinct types: tonal and gunshot. Maximum detection distances were about 30 km for both types of sound. The mean RMS location error was 1.8 km for tonal-type sounds and 2.5 km for gunshot-type sounds. The average RMS error was 20% of the average distance from the receiving hydrophones, the primary source of error being uncertainty in the sonobuoy positions.","Bay of Fundy; Eubalaena glacialis; Localization; Right whale; Sonobuoys","bioacoustics; detection method; hydrophone; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (10 SPEC.

SAGs are typically composed of an adult female with two or more males engaged in social behavior near the surface. Distinct calls, believed to be produced by the female, are associated with these groups. Calls recorded from three North Atlantic right whale SAGs and three South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) SAGs were played back to North Atlantic right whales to determine if these sounds are sufficient to attract males to the groups. Playbacks of gunshot sounds produced by North Atlantic right whales were used as a control stimulus. Thirty-six trials were carried out from 1999 to 2001 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Whales approached 27 of 31 SAG playbacks and 0 of 5 gunshot playbacks. Where sex was determined (n = 28), all approaches to North Atlantic SAG recordings were by males. Individuals (n = 22) of all age and sex classes approached South Atlantic SAG playbacks. These trials indicate that SAG calls from both populations are sufficient to attract tight whales to SAGs and that males and females respond differently to stimuli from the North Atlantic. The difference in response to North and South Atlantic SAG stimuli was unexpected. Novelty, species differences in calls, and different seasonal or behavioral context for the recorded stimuli may be responsible for the differences in response.","Baleen whale; Eubalaena glacialis; Playback; Reproduction; Right whale; Surface active group","behavioral response; calling behavior; intraspecific interaction; reproduction; social behavior; whale; (North); Atlantic Ocean; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,,"Brown, M.W., Kraus, S.D., Gaskin, D.E., White, B.N., Sexual composition and analysis of reproductive females in the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, population (1994) Marine Mammal Science, 10, pp. 252-265; Brownell R.L, Ralls, K., Potential for sperm competition in baleen whales (1986) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

A novel archival tag, called the DTAG, has been developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment. Several deployments have included sound playbacks to the tagged whale and a transient response to at least one playback is evident in the tag data.","Effects of noise; Marine animals; Tags; Underwater acoustic measurements","Acoustic noise measurement; Biocommunications; Hydrophones; Marine engineering; Sensors; Underwater acoustics; Deep diving lifestyle; Digital acoustic recording tag; Eubalaena glacialis; Marine animals; Physeter macrocephalus; Wild marine mammals; Ocean engineering",,,,,"International Fund for Animal Welfare, IFAW

This tag uses FLASH memory in place of moving magnetic tape or disks to record data and so can be encapsulated in plastic. A low-power digital signal processor combines audio, acquired from a hydrophone, with sensor measurements, and streams the data to the nonvolatile memory array. The sensor suite comprises acceleration, magnetic field, and pressure sensors and is tailored to measuring orientation at sampling rates of up to 50 Hz, much higher than traditional time–depth recorders.","Urick, R.J., (1986) Ambient Noise in the Sea, , Los Altos, CA: Peninsula; Green, D.M., DeFerrari, H.A., McFadden, D., Pearse, J.S., Popper, A.N., Richardson, W.J., Ridgway, S.H., Tyack, P.L., Low-frequency sound and marine mammals: Current knowledge and research needs (1994), National Academy Press, Washington, DC, NRC Rep; Richardson, W.J., Greene C.R., Jr., Malme, C.I., Thomson, D.H., (1995) Marine Mammals and Noise, , New York: Academic; Frantzis, A., Does acoustic testing strand whales?

In this paper, we improve the method in four major ways. We use a Markov chain formulation of the life cycle to express the likelihood functions in matrix form, which makes numerical calculations simpler. We introduce a method to incorporate capture histories with uncertain stage and sex identifications, which allows the use of capture history data with incomplete information. We introduce a simple function that allows multinomial transition probabilities to be written as functions of covariates (time or environmental factors). Finally, we show how to convert transition probabilities estimated by the MSMR method into a matrix population model. These methods are applied to data on the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis).","Capture-recapture studies; Eubalaena glacialis; Markov chain; Matrix population models; Multi-stage mark-recapture statistics; North Atlantic right whale; Population projection matrix; Survival probability; Transition probability","mark-recapture method; Markov chain; population estimation; population modeling; whale; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis",,,,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principles (1973) International Symposium on Information Theory.

We examine the effect of this population decline on levels of genetic variation at 16 microsatellite loci and contrast levels of variability to that in a closely related species (E. australis). Of the 13 loci developed from the E. glacialis genome, 100% were polymorphic in E. australis. In contrast, nine loci were polymorphic in E. glacialis and four were fixed. Both allelic diversity (A) and heterozygosity (H) were significantly lower in E. glacialis than E. australis (A = 3.2 ± 2.6 vs. A = 6.9 ± 3.3, P < 0.001; H = 0.31 ± 0.25 vs. H = 0.72 ± 0.23, P < 0.001, respectively). Bottleneck anlayses indicate that the population is in mutation-drift equilibrium and that a genetic bottleneck did not occur during the most recent decline (18th-20th centuries). Nevertheless, low frequency alleles are relatively uncommon in E. glacialis, suggesting that genetic variability has been reduced in this population. Possible origins of low genetic variability are discussed, including the slow but continual erosion of alleles during the 800-year period of decline.","Effective population size; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Heterozygosity; Microsatellites; Population bottleneck; Whales","Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; microsatellite DNA; allele; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; comparative study; environmental protection; gene frequency; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genetics; heterozygote; population density; population dynamics; population genetics; whale; Alleles; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Conservation of Natural Resources; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Heterozygote; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Variation (Genetics); Whales",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old Basque whaling and its effect on right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic (1986) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 10 (SPEC.

In an effort to prevent vessel strikes in the southeastern U.S. calving ground, a communication network was implemented to relay right whale sighting information, gathered by aerial survey teams, to mariners in the area. The system, which has evolved substantially since inception, now provides real-time sighting information to the marine community, thus assisting with avoidance of northern right whales. The current system utilizes 25 cloned alphanumeric pagers distributed to various state, federal, military, and industry representatives. Right whale sightings are reported and disseminated via the pagers, and ultimately via Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) to all ships 100 tons or larger in southeastern waters. This system has been successful in alerting mariners to the presence of right whales, however to address the critical management problems confronting this highly endangered species, further research into technological advancements that may assist in the detection of right whales should be encouraged.",,"Fishing vessels; Telecommunication networks; Whaling vessels; Endangered species; Marine engineering; aerial survey; cetacean; collision avoidance; endangered species; mortality; shipping; (Southeast); United States",,,,,,,,"Kenney, R.D., Kraus, S.D., Right whale mortality - A correction and an update (1993) Mar.

There are now fewer than 300 individuals, and the species may already be functionally extinct owing to demographic stochasticity or the difficulty of females locating mates in the vast Atlantic Ocean (Allee effect4). Using a data set containing over 10,000 sightings of photographically identified individuals we estimated trends in right whale demographic parameters since 1980. Here we construct, using these estimates, matrix population models allowing us to analyse the causes of right whale imperilment. Mortality has increased, especially among mother whales, causing declines in population growth rate, life expectancy and the mean lifetime number of reproductive events between the period 1980-1995. Increased mortality of mother whales can explain the declining population size, suggesting that the population is not doomed to extinction as a result of the Allee effect. An analysis of extinction time shows that demographic stochasticity has only a small effect, but preventing the deaths of only two female right whales per year would increase the population growth rate to replacement level.",,"Biodiversity; Photography; Population statistics; Extinction; Marine biology; demography; endangered species; population decline; whale; animal experiment; article; Atlantic Ocean; demography; environmental monitoring; growth rate; life cycle; nonhuman; priority journal; survival; whale; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Mortality; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Whales; Atlantic Ocean; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia",,,,,,,,"Caswell, H., Fujiwara, M., Brault, S., Declining survival probability threatens the North Atlantic right whale (1999) Proc.

A new non-invasive tag attached to North Atlantic right whales recorded swim stroke from changes in pitch angle derived from a three-axis accelerometer. These results show that right whales are positively buoyant near the surface, a finding that has significant implications for both energetics and management. Some of the most powerful fluke strokes observed in tagged right whales occur as they counteract this buoyancy as they start a dive. By contrast, right whales use positive buoyancy to power glides during ascent. Right whales appear to use their positive buoyancy for more efficient swimming and diving. However, this buoyancy may pose added risks of vessel collision. Such collisions are the primary source of anthropogenic mortality for North Atlantic right whales, whose population is critically endangered and declining. Buoyancy may impede diving responses to oncoming vessels and right whales may have a reduced ability to manoeuvre during free ascents. These risk factors can inform efforts to avoid collisions.","Buoyancy; Conservation; Diving behaviour; Eubalaena glacialis; Tagging","buoyancy; energy conservation; whale; accelerometer; animal behavior; article; Atlantic Ocean; diving; energy conservation; energy transfer; mortality; nonhuman; priority journal; risk factor; swimming; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Paralichthys dentatus; Vertebrata",,,,,,,,"Alexander, R.M., Size, speed, and buoyancy adaptations in aquatic animals (1990) Am.

We searched historical records and computerized stranding databases for evidence of ship strikes involving great whales (i.e., baleen whales and the sperm whale). Historical records suggest that ship strikes fatal to whales first occurred late in the 1800s as ships began to reach speeds of 13-15 kn, remained infrequent until about 1950, and then increased during the 1950s-1970s as the number and speed of ships increased. Of 11 species known to be hit by ships, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are struck most frequently; right whales (Eubalaena glacialis and E. australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whales (Physeter catodon), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are hit commonly. In some areas, one-third of all fin whale and right whale strandings appear to involve ship strikes. To assess contributing factors, we compiled descriptions of 58 collisions. They indicate that all sizes and types of vessels can hit whales; most lethal or severe injuries are caused by ships 80 m or longer; whales usually are not seen beforehand or are seen too late to be avoided; and most lethal or severe injuries involve ships travelling 14 kn or faster. Ship strikes can significantly affect small populations of whales, such as northern right whales in the western North Atlantic. In areas where special caution is needed to avoid such events, measures to reduce the vessel speed below 14 kn may be beneficial.","Mortality; Right whales; Ship collisions; Species conservation; Strandings","collision; mortality; shipping; whale; Balaenoptera physalus; Eschrichtius robustus; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Megaptera novaeangliae; Physeter catodon",,,,,,,,"Alexander, G., (1980) Blue whale apparently killed by Ship, (PART II), p. 8. , Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, CA. 8 July; Allen, G.M., The whalebone whales of New England (1916) Boston Society of Natural History.

Sequences from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from these samples were compared with those from a near-exhaustive survey (269 of approximately 320 individuals) of the remaining right whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest that there has been only relatively modest change in maternal lineage diversity over the past century in the North Atlantic right whale population. Any significant reduction in genetic variation in the species most likely occurred prior to the late nineteenth century. One historical specimen was from the last documented female capable of propagating one of the maternal lineages in the population today; no females in the existing population have been found to carry this mtDNA haplotype. Analysis of the only specimens from the eastern North Atlantic right whale population ever to be examined revealed that eastern and western North Atlantic right whales may not have been genetically differentiated populations. Loss of gene diversity experienced by North Atlantic right whales over the last century has been modest, and the six decades of protection have been successful in maintaining much of the maternal lineage diversity that was present in the late nineteenth century.",,"Balaenidae;

Little morphological evidence exists to support the current species designations for Eubalaena glacialis in the northern hemisphere and E. australis in the southern hemisphere. Differences in migratory behaviour or antitropical distribution between right whales in each hemisphere are considered a barrier to gene flow and maintain the current species distinctions and geographical populations. However, these distinctions between populations have remained controversial and no study has included an analysis of all right whales from the three major ocean basins. To address issues of genetic differentiation and relationships among right whales, we have compiled a database of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from right whales representing populations in all three ocean basins that consist of: western North Atlantic E. glacialis, multiple geographically distributed populations of E. australis and the first molecular analysis of historical and recent samples of E. glacialis from the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Diagnostic characters, as well as phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, support the possibility that three distinct maternal lineages exist in right whales, with North Pacific E. glacialis being more closely related to E. australis than to North Atlantic E. glacialis.

Total PCB concentrations in cetaceans from temperate and cold waters were higher than those in cetaceans from tropical regions. Residue levels were found to be the highest in Fraser's dolphins collected off Kii Peninsula, Japan, and hump-backed dolphins from Hong Kong, reflecting serious marine pollution by PCBs in industrialized Asian countries. Penta- and hexa-chlorobiphenyls were the predominant PCB congeners, accounting for about 70% of the total PCBs. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs) of non- and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs in the blubber of cetaceans ranged from 36 (in spinner dolphins from the Philippines) to 510 pg/g wet weight (in hump-backed dolphins from Hong Kong). Toxic evaluation of coplanar PCBs using the TEQ concept indicates an greater impact on cetaceans from mid-latitudes. Toxicity contribution of mono-ortho congener IUPAC 118 was prominent in species from high latitude oceans, such as the Bering Sea and the North Pacific, whereas non-ortho congener IUPAC 126 accounted for the highest contribution in cetaceans from lower latitude regions, such as the Philippines and India. The estimated TEQ concentrations in the blubber of some cetacean species, such as northern right whale dolphin and Pacific white-sided dolphin from the northern North Pacific, Dall's porpoise from the Japan Sea, striped dolphin off Sanriku and Fraser's dolphin off Kii Peninsula, Japan, hump-backed dolphin and finless porpoise from Hong Kong, exceeded the levels associated with immunosuppression in harbour seals.",,"2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; polychlorinated biphenyl; biological uptake; cetacean; geographical distribution; PCB; article; dolphin; environmental monitoring; evaluation; geographic distribution; industrialization; isomer; Japan; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; porpoise; priority journal; sea pollution; seashore; water pollutant; Animals; Cetacea; Male; Pacific Ocean; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Lissodelphis borealis; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Phocidae; Phocoenidae; Stenella coeruleoalba",,"2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Abnormally high polychlorinated biphenyl levels in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) affected by the 1990-1992 Mediterranean epizootic (1994) Sci Tot Environ, 154, pp. 237-247; Aono, S., Tanabe, S., Fujise, Y., Kato, H., Tatsukawa, R., Persistent organochlorines in minke whale (Balaenoptera Acutorostrata) and their prey species from the Antarctic and the North Pacific (1997) Environ Pollut, 98, pp. 81-89; Boon, J.P., Van der Meer, J., Allchin, C.R., Law, R.J., Klungsoyr, J., Leonards, P.E.G., Spliid, H., Wells, D.E., Concentration-dependent changes of PCB patterns in fish-eating mammals: Structural evidence for induction of cytochrome P450 (1997) Arch Environ Contam Toxicol, 33, pp. 298-311; Carvadine, M., (1995), p. 256. , Whales, dolphins and porpoises.

Organochlorines in right whale skin, feces, and prey were measured and used to identify factors influencing exposure and bioaccumulation. Concentrations of 30 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5.7 ± 8.9 μg/g lipid) and 20 pesticides (11.4 ± 15.4 μg/g lipid) in skin biopsies were consistent with other baleenopterids. Concentrations in feces and prey were two orders of magnitude less than in biopsies. In principal component analysis, organochlorines in biopsies matched those from Bay of Fundy, Canada, zooplankton, whereas feces were like Cape Cod, USA, copepods. Year of biopsy collection was the principal factor associated with differential accumulation of nonmetabolizable PCBs, 4,4'-DDE, and dieldrin. Biopsies collected during winter had lower concentrations of lipid and metabolizable compounds than biopsies collected during summer. Concentrations of metabolizable PCBs increased with age in males. The bioaccumulation patterns implied that blubber burdens change annually because of the ingestion of different prey or prey from distinct locations and the release of some organochlorines stored in blubber during lipid depletion in winter. Because biopsy concentrations were lower than those found in marine mammals affected by PCBs and DDTs, we do not have evidence that the endangered whales bioaccumulate hazardous concentrations of organochlorines.","Bioaccumulation; Pesticide; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Whale; Zooplankton","organochlorine derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; bioaccumulation; organochlorine; pollution exposure; whale; animal tissue; article; Atlantic Ocean; bioaccumulation; chlorination; contamination; copepod; environmental exposure; nonhuman; pesticide spraying; population growth; priority journal; water temperature; whale; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean",,,,,,,,"Waring, G.T., Palka, D.L., Mullin, K.D., Hain, J.H.W., Hansen, L.J., Bisack, K.D., (1997) U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Marine Mammal Stock Assessments - 1996, , NMFS-NE-114.

We examined sightings of right whales on and around Jeffreys Ledge, a 54-km-long glacial deposit off the coast of northern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Sightings on Jeffreys Ledge were extracted from three data sets: (1) a systematic survey of the entire northeastern continental shelf between 1979 and 1982, (2) whale-watch and research-cruise sighting data from 1984 to 1997, and (3) a collaborative database of sightings collected by organizations conducting right whale research and all other available sources. Each database supported two seasonal sighting peaks. During summer (especially July and August) sightings were primarily of mother-calf pairs. Several cow-calf pairs were seen over several days to weeks. Several females were resighted in more than one year, but only when calves were present. During October, November, and December, sightings included all age classes, surface-feeding behavior was frequently observed, and some animals were resighted over several weeks. Given the relatively reduced sighting effort during fall, this number of sightings is surprising. During the 20 yr of observations, 52 of 374 photo-identified North Atlantic right whales (13.9%) were seen at least once on Jeffreys Ledge. We suggest that Jeffreys Ledge may be a more important right whale habitat than previously believed, and that it may play an important role in annual movements and distribution of this population.","Eubalaena glacialis; Jeffreys Ledge; Right whale; Whale distribution; Whale migration","spatial distribution; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Cape Cod; Massachusetts; Nova Scotian Shelf; United States; Animalia; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Gadus morhua",,,,,,,,"Apollonio, S., The Gulf of Maine (1979) Courier of Maine Books, , Rockland, ME; Baraff, L., Weinrich, M.T., Separation of a humpback whale mother and calf on a feeding ground in early autumn (1993) Marine Mammal Science, 9, pp. 431-434; Boyar, C., Cooper, R.A., Clifford, R.A., A study of the spawning and early life history of the herring (Clupea harengus) on Jeffreys Ledge in 1972 (1973) ICNAF Research Document No. 73/96, , 7 pp. Available from Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, 2 Morris Drive, P.

L8S 4K1, Canada","DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of 180 North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 16 South Atlantic right whales (E. australis) have been determined using a combination of direct DNA sequencing and single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Five haplotypes were found in E. glacialis, and 10 in E. australis, but none were shared, supporting the reproductive isolation and separate species status of the North and South Atlantic right whales. One haplotype in E. glacialis was found in only three males born before 1982 and this matriline will likely be lost soon. The nucleotide diversity estimates for the five North Atlantic right whale haplotypes was 0.6% and 2.0% for the 10 haplotypes found in the South Atlantic right whales. The average haplotypic diversity was 0.87 in E. glacialis and 0.96 in E. australis, which is consistent with other studies showing a lower level of genetic variation in the North Atlantic right whale. Phylogenetic analysis identified two major assemblages of haplotypes in E. australis from the samples collected from Peninsula Valdes, suggesting a mixing of two historically divergent populations. Using genetic distance measurements with a divergence rate of 0.5%-1.0%/myr, we estimate E. glacialis diverged from E. australis 3-12.5 mya.","Genetic diversity; Mitochondrial DNA; Right whales","Atlantic Ocean; genetic distance; genetic diversity; genetic variance; haplotype; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; single strand conformation polymorphism; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; mitochondrial DNA; population genetics; reproductive isolation; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena australis; Eubalaena glacialis; Eubalaena glacialis; Mammalia; Mya",,,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., A review of old basque whaling and its effect on the right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the north Atlantic (1986) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.
