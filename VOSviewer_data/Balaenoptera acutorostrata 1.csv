We examined trends in the sex ratio of catches over time, season, space, and relative to sea temperature using 2400 records from inshore Greenland subsistence whaling operations (1960-2006) and 2072 records from offshore Norwegian commercial operations (1968-1985). Logistic regression models were developed to examine the trend in sex ratio in three regions (Northwest, NW; Central West, CW; Southwest, SW) and by latitude. The highly skewed proportion of females in all catches was strongly positively correlated (r2 = 0.8) with latitude in the offshore catches (&gt;100 km). Generalized linear models of inshore catches indicated slightly increasing though non-significant trends in the proportion of females taken off CW and NW Greenland and a significant declining trend off SW Greenland. Sensitivity analyses show that the declining inshore SW trend was entirely accounted for by the past 5 years (2002-2006) of data. Models containing both year and temperature interactions suggested that either parameter provided an equivalent explanation of the variation in trends across regions. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Because this species inhabits coastal areas, it became a main target species of coastal small-type whaling in the North Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific Oceans, and the species' population size dramatically decreased because of over-exploitation. As a result, the International Whaling Commission declared a global moratorium on whaling and launched the development of a management procedure for protecting the whales. Morphological studies, whaling history analysis, and genetic studies conducted mainly by Japanese scientists showed the existence of one unique ""E"" stock that inhabits the waters around the Korean peninsula and mixes with the ""O"" stock in the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. We used the mitochondrial DNA control region polymorphism of 348 Minke whales bycaught or stranded in Korean waters from 30 October 1998 to 25 June 2005 to assess the whale population structure by year. The frequency of the 10 major haplotypes from the 40 identified haplotypes was not significantly different among groups, suggesting that a subpopulation was not present. A comparison of the genetic distances calculated with Tamura-Nei's method showed that the distances between groups were lower than those within groups, which suggests that there was no genetic difference in the Minke whale populations. The Fst comparison between groups and the phylogenetic tree constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) method also detected no obvious sub-stock structure.","Haplotype; Minke whales; Mitochondrial DNA; Polymorphism; Population structure","Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mysticeti",,,,,"National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, NFRDI: RP-2009-BT-026","This work was funded by a grant from the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI), contribution number RP-2009-BT-026.

A discussion of the chronospecies Balaenoptera acutorostrata cuvieri is presented here which dismisses such taxon in the light of a thorough morphological analysis based upon the examination of a number of mystice te skeletons in the collections of many institutions all over the world. An overview of new mysticete taxa established from the Italian fossil record is also presented together with reconstructions of their skulls. The analysis of the Italian record shows that the Mediterranean basin played a role in the preservation of archaic biodiversity especially concerning the Balaenopteridae. The presence of Eschrichtiidae is also confirmed based on the newly discovered taxon Eschrichtioides gastaldi The study of the Italian record is, thus, of great help in the reconstruction of the past mysticete biodiversity evolution and in the analysis of the phylogeny of this marine mammal group.","Cetacea; Evolution; Italy; Mysticeti; Pliocene; Taxonomy","cetacean; evolutionary theory; fossil record; marine record; morphology; paleoenvironment; phylogeny; Pliocene; skull; taxonomy; Italy; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Arnold, R.W., Birtles, R.A., Sobtzik, S., Matthews, S., Dunstan, A., Gulping behaviour in rorqual whales: Underwater observations and functional interpretation (2005) Memoires of the Queensland Museum, 51, pp. 309-332; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Which whales are hunted?

Morphological and genetic evidence of a second species accumulated through the last quarter of the twentieth century, and the Antarctic minke whale, B. bonaerenis, came to be fully recognized in the late 1990s. Based on genetic data, the two species are hypothesized to have diverged less than 5 million years ago in the Southern Hemisphere. In both species, the rostrum is very narrow and pointed and there is a single ridge on the head. The dorsal fin is relatively tall and falcate and is located relatively far forward on the posterior one-third of the body. The average length of the common minke whale in the North Atlantic at physical maturity has been estimated variously at about 8.5-8.8 m in females and 7.8-8.2 m in males. The skull is larger in B. bonaerensis than in both northern and southern forms of B. acutorostrata. Common minke whales are noted for their curiosity about ships, often coming from afar to cross the bow or run with the vessel for minutes or hours. They are difficult to spot at a distance because of their small inconspicuous blow and brief surfacing behavior. Single animals are often seen and groups are usually small, consisting of two or three individuals, although larger aggregations of up to 400 may form on occasion in high latitudes. Differential migration by sex and age leads to segregation by sex and breeding condition. Mating behavior has not been directly observed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents data on the concentrations and accumulation features of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in muscle of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus capensis) collected from Korean coastal waters. The residue levels in cetaceans were in the order of mono-ortho PCBs> non-ortho PCBs>PCDFs>PCDDs. Total toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations in muscle of minke whales and common dolphins from Korea were lower than those reported for cetaceans and seals from other countries. The accumulation profiles of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs were different between the cetacean species. Concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in common dolphins were significantly higher than those measured in minke whales, due to differences in the habitat and diet. The relative contribution of individual chemical groups to total TEQs was different between the cetacean species, suggesting different exposures and metabolic activity. © 2009 The Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science and Springer.","Common dolphins; Metabolic activity; Minke whales; PCBs; PCDD/Fs; TEQ",,,,,,,,"Baccarelli, A., Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-dependent pathway and toxic effects of TCDD in humans: A population-based study in Seveso, Italy (2004) Toxicol Let, 149, pp. 287-293; Mos, L., Chemical and biological pollution contribute to the immunological profiles of free-ranging harbor seals (2006) Environ Toxicol Chem, 25, pp. 3110-3117; Covaci, A., The Belgian PCB/dioxin crisis-8 years late: An overview (2008) Environ Toxicol Pharmacol, 25, pp. 164-170; Olie, K., Vermeulen, P.L., Hutzinger, O., Chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and chlorodibenzofurans are trace components of fly ash and flue gas of some municipal incinerators in the Netherlands (1977) Chemosphere, 8, pp. 455-459; Kannan, K., Watanabe, S., Giesy, J.P., Congener profile of polychlorinated/brominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in soil and sediments collected at a former chlor-alkali plant (1998) Toxicol Environ Chem, 67, pp. 135-146; Lewis, M., Weber, D., Stanley, R., Albrecht, B., Treated wastewater as a source of sediment contamination in Gulf of Mexico near-coastal areas: A survey (2000) Environ Toxicol Chem, 19, pp. 192-203; Koh, C.-H., Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD equivalents (TEQs) in sediment from the Hyeongsan River, Korea (2004) Environ Pollut, 132, pp. 489-501; Moon, H.-B., Choi, H.-G., Lee, P.-Y., Ok, G., Congener-specific characterization and sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in marine sediments from industrialized bays of Korea (2008) Environ Toxicol Contam, 27, pp. 323-333; Moon, H.-B., Yoon, S.-P., Jung, R.-H., Choi, M., Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as a source of sediment contamination by toxic organic pollutants and fecal sterols in a semi-enclosed bay in Korea (2008) Chemosphere, 73, pp. 880-889; Kannan, K., Isomer-specific analysis and toxic evaluation of polychlorinated biphenyls in striped dolphins affected by an epizootic in the western Mediterranean Sea (1993) Arch Environ Contam Toxicol, 25, pp. 227-233; Hickie, B.E., Ross, P.S., Macdonald, R.W., Ford, J.K.B., Killer whales (Orcinus orca) face protracted health risks associated with lifetime exposure to PCBs (2007) Environ Sci Technol, 41, pp. 6613-6619; An, Y.-R., Kim, Z.-G., Progress report on cetacean research, January 2006 to December 2006, with statistical data for the calendar year 2006 in Republic of Korea (2008) J Cetacean Res Manage, 1, pp. 353-403; Moon, H.-B., Ok, G., Dietary intake of PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs, due to the consumption of various marine organisms from Korea (2006) Chemosphere, 62, pp. 1142-1152; Moon, H.-B., Choi, H.-G., Human exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs associated with seafood consumption in Korea from 2005-2007 (2009) Environ Int, 35, pp. 279-284; Kajiwara, N., Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Caspian seals of unusual mortality event during 2000 and 2001 (2008) Environ Pollut, 152, pp. 431-442; Yang, F., Preliminary hazard assessment of polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans to Yangtze finless porpoise in Dongting Lake, China (2008) Environ Toxicol Chem, 27, pp. 991-996; Imaeda, D., Accumulation features and temporal trends of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in Baikal seals (Pusa sibirca) (2009) Environ Pollut, 157, pp. 737-747; Weijs, L., Inter-species differences for polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in marine top predators from the Southern North Sea: Part 1.

The catalytic activity of major xenobiotic-metabolizing phase I and II hepatic microsomal enzymes was assessed. Relative to control dogs, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in exposed dogs was twofold higher ( p = 0.001). Testosterone hydroxylation yielded 6β- and 16β-hydroxy (OH) testosterone and androstenedione, with higher rates of production (23-27%; p ≤ 0.03) in the exposed individuals. In the exposed dogs, epoxide hydrolase (EH) activity was 31% higher ( p = 0.02) relative to the control dogs, whereas uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) activity was not different ( p = 0.62). When the exposed and control dogs were combined, the summed (Σ) plasma concentrations of OH-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were predicted by plasma ΣPCB concentrations and EROD activity ( p ≤ 0.04), whereas testosterone hydroxylase, EH, and UDPGT activities were not significant predictors of these concentrations. Consistent results were found for individual OH-PCB congeners and their theoretical precursor PCBs (e.g., 4-OH-CB-187 and CB-183, and 4-OH-CB-146 and CB-146) and for EROD activity. No association was found between ΣOH-polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and ΣPBDE plasma concentrations, or between potential precursor-metabolite pairs, and the enzyme activities. The present results suggest that liver microsomal EROD activity and plasma PCB concentrations have a greater (e.g., relative to EH activity) predictive power for the occurrence of plasma OHPCB residues in sledge dogs. These results also suggest that plasma OH-PBDEs likely are not products of cytochrome P450-mediated transformation but, rather, are accumulated via the diet. © 2009 SETAC.","Arctic; Biotransformation enzymes; Hydroxylated metabolites; Organohalogens; Sledge dog","Biotransformation enzymes; Catalytic activity; Contaminated diet; Control groups; Cytochrome p450; Epoxide hydrolases; EROD activity; Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase; Greenland; Hydroxylases; Hydroxylated metabolites; Microsomal enzymes; Minke whales; Organohalogens; PCB concentration; PCB congeners; Phase I; Plasma concentration; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers; Predictive power; Sledge dog; Testosterone hydroxylation; Xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes; Biomolecules; Catalysts; Concentration (process); Ecology; Electric circuit breakers; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Ethers; Hydroxylation; Metabolism; Metabolites; Nutrition; Organic pollutants; Plasmas; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuits; Chemical contamination; 16beta hydroxytestosterone; 6beta hydroxytestosterone; androstenedione; epoxide hydrolase; ethoxyresorufin deethylase; microsome enzyme; organohalogen derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; testosterone; testosterone derivative; testosterone hydroxylase; unclassified drug; uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase; cytochrome P450 1A1; epoxide hydrolase; glucuronosyltransferase; halogen; mixed function oxidase; organic compound; xenobiotic agent; blood; canid; captive population; comparative study; cytochrome; enzyme activity; metabolism; organohalogen; pollution exposure; testosterone; xenobiotics; animal experiment; article; biotransformation; blood level; Canis familiaris; controlled study; dog; enzyme activity; hydroxylation; liver microsome metabolism; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; animal; comparative study; enzymology; female; Greenland; liver microsome; metabolism; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Canis familiaris; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Dogs; Epoxide Hydrolases; Female; Glucuronosyltransferase; Greenland; Halogens; Hydroxylation; Microsomes, Liver; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Organic Chemicals; Xenobiotics",,"androstenedione, 26264-53-9, 63-05-8; epoxide hydrolase, 51004-26-3, 9048-63-9; ethoxyresorufin deethylase, 59793-97-4; testosterone, 58-22-0; glucuronosyltransferase, 37329-64-9, 9030-08-4; mixed function oxidase, 9040-60-2; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1, 1.14.14.1; Epoxide Hydrolases, 3.3.2.3; Glucuronosyltransferase, 2.4.1.17; Halogens; Mixed Function Oxygenases, 1.-; Organic Chemicals; Xenobiotics",,,,,"Hakk, H., Letcher, R.J., Metabolism in the toxicokinetics and fate of brominated flame retardants - A review (2003) Environ Int, 29, pp. 801-828; Kawano, M., Hasegawa, J., Enomoto, T., Onishi, H., Nishio, Y., Matsuda, M., Wakimoto, T., Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs): Recent advances in wildlife contamination study (2005) Environ Sci, 12, pp. 315-324; Letcher, R.J., Klasson-Wehler, E., Bergman, A., Methyl sulfone and hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (2000) The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry - New Types of Persistent Halogenated Compounds, 3, pp. 315-359. , Paasivita J, ed, Part K.

In order to better understand the habitat selection, movements and feeding ecology of the animals utilising this North Sea region, distribution data from the southern coastline of the outer Moray Firth were subsequently examined with respect to the marine physiography of the area, specifically the environmental variables water depth, slope, aspect and sediment-type. A total of 305 minke whale encounters - collected from dedicated boat surveys conducted between May and October 2001 to 2006 inclusive - were used in the construction of a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the 860 square-km study site. The subsequent analysis revealed a strong spatial preference by whales in this location for water depths between 20 and 50 metres (mean 46.9 m, SD=30.9), steep slopes (mean 75.7 degrees, SD= 8.9), a northerly-facing aspect and sandy-gravel sediment type. Kruskal-Wallis tests for variance confirmed that the distribution of B. acutorostrata was significantly different across each of these physiographic features examined (P&lt; 0.05). In particular, water depth and sediment type were shown to be highly correlated with the frequency of whales observed (Spearman's Rank Correlation P&lt;0.05 for depth and sediment respectively). From these results, we conclude that sea bottom characteristics may be used to predict the fine-scale distribution of minke whales on their feeding grounds; the physiographic features identified providing valuable proxies for inferring prey distributions in the absence of fisheries data. However, an appreciation of both abiotic and biotic factors (using a combination of GIS and remote sensing outputs) is clearly desirable for ecosystem-based management approaches for the coastal conservation of these whales. The application of GIS capacities to ecological studies based largely on field data of these marine mammals is highly recommended in the present study to cetologists, environmental modellers and conservation managers alike. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Conservation; Environmental factors; GIS; Habitat; Minke whale; Moray firth; Physiography",,,,,,"Scottish Natural Heritage, SNH","Acknowledgements This work was carried out under licence from Scottish Natural Heritage with financial assistance from the Earth-watch Institute, Ecocorps Scotland and Care for the Wild International.

As a consequence, there has been only limited use of active acoustic techniques by marine mammal researchers. Instead more attention has been given to the development and use of passive acoustic methods for the detection of cetaceans. Nevertheless there is great potential for the use of active acoustic systems in ecological studies, and studies aimed at improving conservation of whales and dolphins in their natural environment: active acoustic techniques can be used for the good of cetaceans, and should not just be considered a source of disturbance. We evaluated the capability of various acoustic systems - systems that are used commonly in fisheries research - to detect and track cetaceans underwater. We collected data initially with standard scientific echosounders (SIMRAD EK500) from moving vessels and from fixed moorings (EK60) at 38 and 120 kHz. Scientific echosounders have narrow beams and therefore enable sampling from only fixed and limited volumes. To overcome these limitations we progressed to use high frequency omnidirectional sonar (SIMRAD SH80) operating at 110 kHz. During Norwegian Sea ecosystem surveys (2006-2008) we recorded the backscatter energy from three species of large whales: Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeanglie). During the observations no avoidance reactions by cetaceans were observed, even when the vessel's entire suite of active acoustic instruments were running (frequency range from 18 kHz to 200 kHz, maximum source level 210 dB re 1 μPa (at 20 and 110 kHz). Here we present a small sample of data from two Fin whales that show the animals backscatter response at broadside. In addition, we give an overview of the present status and possible future development of the use of standard active acoustic methods for cetacean studies. Omnidirectional sonar shows great potential as a tool for marine mammal detection, and could be developed to produce an automatic cetacean detector. Such a detector would be a highly valuable aid for seismic mitigation and ship strike prevention, and in addition could contribute to behavioural studies with its high definition time scale. Much work is required to understand relationships between cetacean body shape, physiology, kinematics and acoustic reflectivity, before a detector can be realized.",,"Acoustic method; Acoustic systems; Acoustic techniques; Active sonar; Body shapes; Echo sounders; Ecological studies; Frequency ranges; High definition; High frequency; Humpback whales; Marine environment; Marine mammals; Minke whales; Narrow beams; Natural environments; Passive acoustics; Possible futures; Present status; Seismic mitigation; Small samples; Sonar use; Source level; Time-scales; Acoustic fields; Backscattering; Ecology; Fins (heat exchange); Mammals; Profilometry; Sonar; Tracking (position); Underwater acoustics; Bioacoustics",,,,,,,"Axelsen, B.E., Anker-Nilssen, T., Fossum, P., Kvamme, C., Nøttestad, L., Pretty patterns but a simple strategy: Predator-prey interactions between juvenile herring and atlantic puffins observed with multibeam sonar (2001) Can.

Quantitative information on prey consumption of whales is useful to understand their feeding ecology and role in the ecosystem. The purposes of this study are 1) to investigate the feeding habit of Antarctic minke whales based on information on prey species, freshness and diurnal change in stomach contents, and 2) to estimate the amount of prey consumed by whales. Estimates are made for whales of different sexual maturity classes as it is expected that the energy requirements vary among them. The analysis is based on the data from whales taken by JARPA (Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic) in a longitudinal sector between 35o E and 145o W, and south of 60o S. Sampling was conducted in the austral summer seasons from 1987/1988 to 2004/2005, mainly in the months from December to March. Daily prey consumption by the whales in each sexual maturity class was estimated using energy-requirement and energy deposition. The whales feed mainly before 05:00 h, which suggest that they cease to feed early in the day. Daily prey consumptions were estimated to be 83.7-325.5 kg, equivalent to 2.7-4.0% of body weight. The mean prey consumptions per capita during feeding season were 7.5 and 16.4 t for immature and mature male, 12.5 and 39.1 t for immature and mature female, respectively. In Area IV (70°-130°E), total prey consumptions of krill by Antarctic minke whales in 1999/2000 and 2001/2002 seasons were estimated to be 0.9 and 1.1 million t, respectively. In Area V (130° E-170° W including the Ross Sea), these estimates in 2000/2001 and 2002/2003 seasons were 3.9 and 4.1 million t, respectively. The estimations of feeding impact on krill resources by Antarctic minke whales in Areas IV and V were from 2.7 to 3.2%, and from 18.2 to 18.9% of krill biomasses, respectively. These results on prey consumption are important input data for the development of ecosystem modeling in the Southern Ocean.","Antarctic minke whale; Feeding habit; Krill; Prey consumption","body size; ecosystem modeling; feeding ecology; prey preference; sexual maturity; stomach content; whale; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Armstrong, A.J., Siegfried, W.R., Consumption of Antarctic krill by minke whales (1991) Antarct.

We investigated the geographic distribution and temporal changes in stock composition of NP minke whale products sold on Japanese markets between December 1997 and June 2004. From nearly 1200 'whale meat' products purchased during this time, 250 were identified as NP minke whales by phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. The 250 NP minke whale products were found to represent 201 unique 'market individuals' after exclusion of replicate products using microsatellite genotypes. Market individuals were further classified into four mtDNA haplogroups, three of which are characteristic of the J-stock (J-type) and one characteristic of the O-stock (O-type). There were moderate differences in the proportions of J-type individuals found in coastal prefectures, perhaps reflecting regional differences in the sale of local bycatch, but no significant difference across time. The absence of a change over time was inconsistent with the four- to fivefold increase in reported bycatch, from an average of 25-122 whales year-1, following a 2001 regulation allowing commercial sale of whales taken as bycatch. Using a mixed-stock analysis based on haplogroup frequencies over the entire survey period, we estimated that 46.1% (se, 4.2%) of all market individuals originated from the J-stock. This estimate of illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) exploitation is higher than expected from the officially reported bycatch, suggesting either large-scale under-reporting and/or unrecognized takes of J-stock minke whales from Pacific coastal waters by the scientific hunt. Our estimates of the true level of IUU exploitation have important implications for recovery of this depleted coastal stock. © 2009 The Authors.

Likely causes are natural variability, climate change, overfishing and predator-prey interactions. In this study, we use an age-length structured multi-species model (Gadget, Globally applicable Area-Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) to analyse the historic population dynamics of major fish and marine mammal species in the Barents Sea. The model was used to examine possible effects of a number of plausible biological and fisheries scenarios. The results suggest that changes in cod mortality from fishing or cod cannibalism levels have the largest effect on the ecosystem, while changes to the capelin fishery have had only minor effects. Alternate whale migration scenarios had only a moderate impact on the modelled ecosystem. Indirect effects are seen to be important, with cod fishing pressure, cod cannibalism and whale predation on cod having an indirect impact on capelin, emphasising the importance of multi-species modelling in understanding and managing ecosystems. Models such as the one presented here provide one step towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study we describe the nematode communities in sediments under the implanted whale carcass. Abundance of nematodes increased with the distance from the carcass. Dominant trophic group was non-selective deposit feeders. The highest values of indexes of a specific diversity and evenness were noted in sediments under the whale, while domination index occurred at the highest distance from the whale. The suggestion is made that the cause of low density of nematodes in sediments under the whale is an extreme increase in number of macrofaunal animals, and predation and food competition between macro- and meiofauna. The changes noted in nematode assemblages living in an implanted whale in shallow waters are similar to those in deep-sea assemblages. © 2009 Korea Ocean Research & Development Institute (KORDI) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Netherlands.","density; macrobenthos; marine nematodes; meiobenthos; whale carcass","abundance; community structure; macrobenthos; meiofauna; nematode; sediment analysis; shallow water; species diversity; species evenness; trophic structure; whale; Peter the Great Bay; Primorye; Russian Federation; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Nematoda",,,,,"Far East Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences

Since 1994, Brucella strains have been isolated from a wide range of marine mammals. They are currently recognized as two new Brucella species, B. pinnipedialis for the pinniped isolates and B. ceti for the cetacean isolates in agreement with host preference and specific phenotypic and molecular markers. In order to investigate the genetic relationships within the marine mammal Brucella isolates and with reference to terrestrial mammal Brucella isolates, we applied in this study the Multiple Loci VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) Analysis (MLVA) approach. A previously published assay comprising 16 loci (MLVA-16) that has been shown to be highly relevant and efficient for typing and clustering Brucella strains from animal and human origin was used. Results. 294 marine mammal Brucella strains collected in European waters from 173 animals and a human isolate from New Zealand presumably from marine origin were investigated by MLVA-16. Marine mammal Brucella isolates were shown to be different from the recognized terrestrial mammal Brucella species and biovars and corresponded to 3 major related groups, one specific of the B. ceti strains, one of the B. pinnipedialis strains and the last composed of the human isolate. In the B. ceti group, 3 subclusters were identified, distinguishing a cluster of dolphin, minke whale and porpoise isolates and two clusters mostly composed of dolphin isolates. These results were in accordance with published analyses using other phenotypic or molecular approaches, or different panels of VNTR loci. The B. pinnipedialis group could be similarly subdivided in 3 subclusters, one composed exclusively of isolates from hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) and the two others comprising other seal species isolates. Conclusion. The clustering analysis of a large collection of marine mammal Brucella isolates from European waters significantly strengthens the current view of the population structure of these two species, and their relative position with respect to the rest of the Brucella genus. MLVA-16 is confirmed as being a rapid, highly discriminatory and reproducible method to classify Brucella strains including the marine mammal isolates. The Brucella2009 MLVA-16 genotyping database available at http://mlva.u-psud.fr/ is providing a detailed coverage of all 9 currently recognized Brucella species. © 2009 Maquart et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article;

During 7 seasons (20002006), a total of 230 research cruises were performed, in which 38 events of interactions among humpback whales and other cetaceans (Tursiops truncatus, Steno bredanensis, Peponocephala electra and Balaenoptera acutorostrata) were observed, plus another 5 encounters without the whale's presence, including T. truncatus, S. bredanensis, P. electra, Stenella clymene and Stenella attenuata. Our results confirm the occurrence of multiple cetacean species in the Bahia State, being the first study in the world to report on a large range of interactions involving another 4 cetacean species, grouped with up to 3 mixed species per sighting, with humpback whales in their annual breeding ground. © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Bahia; Brazil; Cetacean interactions; Megaptera novaeangliae","behavior; breeding season; dolphin; interspecific interaction; spatial distribution; whale; Bahia; Brazil; South America; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Peponocephala electra; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella clymene; Steno bredanensis; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Arnbom, T., Papastavrou, V., Weilgart, L.S., Witehead, H., Sperm whales react to an attack by killer whales (1987) Journal of Mammalogy, 68, pp. 450-453; Baracho, C., Rossi-Santos, M.R., Cipolotti, S., Neto, E., Marcovaldi, E., Novas informa̧cões sobre a ocorrência de odontocetos (Cetacea: Delphinidae) na região de Itacaré, Estado da Bahia, Brasil (2006) Abstracts of the VII Congresso Internacional Sobre Manejo de Fauna Silvestre Na Amazônia e América Latina, , Universidade Estadual Santa Cruz, Ilhéus; Baumgartner, M.F., The distribution of Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) with respect to the physiography of the northern Gulf of Mexico (1997) Marine Mammal Science, 13, pp. 614-638; Carvalho, M.S., Rossi-Santos, M.R., Baracho, C.G., Cipolotti, S.R., Lima, F., Marcovaldi, E., Opportunistic sightings of dolphins in the North Coast of Bahia State, Northeastern Brazil, between 2001 and 2006 (2007) Abstracts of the 17th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, , Cape Town, South Africa; Ciano, J.N., Jorgensen, R., Observations on an interaction between a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and pilot whales (Globicephala melas) (2000) Marine Mammal Science, 16, pp. 245-248; Clapham, P.J., The humpback whale: Seasonal feeding and breeding in baleen whales (2000) Cetacean Societies, Field Studies of Dolphins and Whales, pp. 173-196. , Mann J., Connor R.C., Tyack P.T. and Whitehead H.

In the years 19922005, there were 252 cetacean stranding events, representing 19 species: three species of Balaenopteridae, three Physeteridae, two Kogiidae, two Ziphiidae and 11 Delphinidae. Three species comprised the majority (78.9%) of stranding events: estuarine dolphin, Sotalia guianensis (61.9%); sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (10.3%); and rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis (6.7%). There was an increasing trend in the number of cases reported in the first five years with a highest frequency achieved in 1996. Stranding events occurred throughout the year, with the lowest frequency occurring in the autumn (MarchMay). Approximately 4% of the events were attributed to natural causes while 24.6% were human-related, mainly incidental captures. Meat removal for human consumption or bait was recorded in 6.7% of events. In the study area, Sotalia guianensis, P. macrocephalus and Steno bredanensis were the most abundant cetacean species, whereas Lagenodelphis hosei, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Kogia sima, Mesoplodon europaeus, Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis are probably rare in the area. © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.","Cear; Cetacean strandings; Incidental capture; North-eastern Brazil","cetacean; coastal zone; seasonality; stranding; Brazil; Ceara; South America; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Kogia simus; Kogiidae; Lagenodelphis hosei; Mesoplodon europaeus; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Pseudorca crassidens; Sotalia guianensis; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Alves, M.D.O., Meirelles, A.C.O., Barros, H.M.D.R., Silva, C.P.N., Campos, A.A., Primeiro registro de falsa orca, Pseudorca crassi-dens (CETACEA: DELPHINIDAE), para o litoral do Estado do Ceará (2002) Arquivo de Ciências Do Mar, 35, pp. 107-112; Alves-Júnior, T.T., Registros de cetáceos para o litoral do estado do Ceará, Brasil (1996) Arquivo de Ciências Do Mar, 30, pp. 79-92; Attademo, F.L.N., (2007) Caracteriza̧cão da Pesca Artesanal e Interação Com Maḿiferos Marinhos Na Região da Costa Branca Do Rio Grande Do Norte, , MSc thesis.

The exposed group (n=16) was fed a diet based on wild minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber as a main fat source in order to mimic the exposure to OC cocktails in the Artic environment. This resulted in an exposure of approximately 17 μg ∑OC/kg day and a ∑OC residue adipose tissue and liver concentration of 1700 and 4470 ng/g l.w., respectively, after 16 months of exposure. Control foxes (n=13) were fed a diet with pork (Sus scrofa) fat as a main fat source containing significantly lower OC concentrations. The food composition fed to the control and exposed group was standardized for nutrient contents. Four OC-related histopathological changes were found: (1) flat-epithelial-cell true thyroid cysts (TC) characterized by neutral content; (2) remnants of simple squamous epithelial-cell embryonic ducts containing neutral debris (EDN); (3) remnants of stratified squamous epithelial-cell embryonic ducts containing acid mucins often accompanied with debris of leukocyte inflammatory nature (EDM) and (4) disseminated thyroid C-cell hyperplasia (HPC). Of these, the prevalence of TC, EDN and HPC was significantly highest in the exposed group (χ2 test: all p&lt;0.04). The study shows that the OC mixture in minke whale blubber may cause development of thyroid gland cysts, C-cell hyperplasia and increase the prevalence of cystic remnants of embryonic ducts. The mechanism causing these effects could include endocrine disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, a disturbance of the calcium homeostasis/metabolism or energy metabolism or immune suppression. Because concentrations of OCs are higher in wild Arctic foxes, it is likely that these animals could suffer from similar OC-induced thyroid gland pathological and functional changes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The current Norwegian policy on marine mammal management is one example. Scientific support for this policy includes the Scenario Barents Sea (SBS) models. These modelled interactions between cod, Gadus morhua, herring, Clupea harengus, capelin, Mallotus villosus and northern minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata. Adding harp seals Phoca groenlandica into this top-down modelling approach resulted in unrealistic model outputs. Another set of models of the Barents Sea fish-fisheries system focused on interactions within and between the three fish populations, fisheries and climate. These model key processes of the system successfully. Continuing calls to support the SBS models despite their failure suggest a belief that marine mammal predation must be a problem for fisheries. The best available scientific evidence provides no justification for marine mammal culls as a primary component of an ecosystem-based approach to managing the fisheries of the Barents Sea. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Balaenoptera; Ecosystem models; Ecosystem-based fishery management; Whaling","Atlantic cod; Atlantic herring; Balaenoptera; climate; ecosystem; food industry; marine mammal; minke whale; nonhuman; note; Phoca; policy; population; priority journal; process model; animal; Arctic; biological model; editorial; minke whale; Osmeriformes; Phoca; predation; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Clupea harengus; Clupeidae; Gadus morhua; Mallotus (fish); Mallotus villosus; Mammalia; Phoca groenlandica; Animals; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Gadus morhua; Minke Whale; Models, Biological; Osmeriformes; Phoca; Predatory Behavior",,,,,,,"Aldrin, M., Schweder, T., (2005) ScenarioC - Sluttrapport., , http://publications.nr.no/SAMBA1305.pdf, Unpublished report, Norsk Regnesentral.

Baleen whales in the Antarctic feed primarily on krill, and the large sympatric prewhaling community suggests resource partitioning among these species or a nonlimiting prey resource. In order to examine ecological differences between sympatric humpback and minke whales around the Western Antarctic Peninsula, we made measurements of the physical environment, observations of whale distribution, and concurrent acoustic measurements of krill aggregations. Mantel's tests and classification and regression tree models indicate both similarities and differences in the spatial associations between humpback and minke whales, environmental features, and prey. The data suggest (1) similarities (proximity to shore) and differences (prey abundance versus deep water temperatures) in horizontal spatial distribution patterns, (2) unambiguous vertical resource partitioning with minke whales associating with deeper krill aggregations across a range of spatial scales, and (3) that interference competition between these two species is unlikely. These results add to the paucity of ecological knowledge relating baleen whales and their prey in the Antarctic and should be considered in conservation and management efforts for Southern Ocean cetaceans and ecosystems. © 2009 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Antarctica; Diving and foraging behavior; Krill; Spatial analysis; Whales","coexistence; crustacean; deep water; diving behavior; environmental factor; foraging behavior; interference competition; niche partitioning; prey availability; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; sympatry; water temperature; whale; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Dugger, K.M., Toniolo, V., Gaffney, I., Cetacean occurrence patterns in the Amundsen and southern Bellingshausen Sea sector, Southern Ocean (2007) Marine Mammal Science, 23, pp. 287-305. , and; Anderson, P.S., Evidence of an Antarctic winter coastal polynya (1993) Antarctic Science, 5, pp. 221-226; Ashjian, C.J., Rosenwaks, G.A., Wiebe, P.H., Davis, C.S., Gallager, S.M., Copley, N.J., Lawson, G.L., Alatalo, P., Distribution of zooplankton on the continental shelf off Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, during Austral fall and winter 2001 (2004) Deep-Sea Research II, 51, pp. 2073-2098. , and; Baker, C.S., Clapham, P.J., Modelling the past and future of whales and whaling (2004) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 19, pp. 365-371. , and; Bolmer, S.T., Beardsley, R.C., Pudsey, C., Mooris, P., Wiebe, P.H., Hofmann, E.E., Anderson, J., Maldonado, A., (2004) High-resolution Bathymetry Map for the Marguerite Bay and Adjacent West Antarctic Peninsula Shelf for the Southern Ocean GLOBEC Program, p. 76. , and.

Location : The study area included all major inland waters of Southeast Alaska. Methods : Between 1991 and 2007, cetacean surveys were conducted by observers who kept a constant watch when the vessel was underway and recorded all cetaceans encountered. For each species, we examined distributional patterns, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends. Analysis of variance (anovaF) was used to test for differences in group sizes between multiple means, and Student's t-test was used to detect differences between pairwise means. Cetacean seasonal occurrence and annual trends were investigated using a generalized linear model framework. Results : Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were seen throughout the region, with numbers lowest in spring and highest in the fall. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) distributions were more restricted than that reported for humpback whales, and the low number of sightings precluded evaluating seasonal trends. Three killer whale (Orcinus orca) eco-types were documented with distributions occurring throughout inland waters. Seasonal patterns were not detected or could not be evaluated for resident and offshore killer whales, respectively; however, the transient eco-type was more abundant in the summer. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were distributed throughout the region, with more sightings in spring and summer than in fall. Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution was clumped, with concentrations occurring in the Icy Strait/Glacier Bay and Wrangell areas and with no evidence of seasonality. Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) were observed only occasionally, with more sightings in the spring. For most species, group size varied on both an annual and seasonal basis. Main conclusions : Seven cetacean species occupy the inland waters of Southeast Alaska, with distribution, group size, seasonal occurrence and annual trends varying by species. Future studies that compare spatial and temporal patterns with other features (e.g. oceanography, prey resources) may help in identifying the key factors that support the high density and biodiversity of cetaceans found in this region. An increased understanding of the region's marine ecology is an essential step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of cetaceans in Southeast Alaska. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Annual trends; Cetaceans; Distribution; Group size; Multi-year investigations; Seasonal occurrence; Southeast Alaska","biodiversity; biological survey; cetacean; ecotype; group size; inland sea; marine ecosystem; population distribution; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; species occurrence; variance analysis; zoogeography; Alaska; North America; United States; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli",,,,,,,"Baird, R.W., The killer whale - Foraging specializations and group hunting (2000) Cetacean Societies: Field Studies on Dolphins and Whales, pp. 127-153. , ed. by.

PCB congeners accounting for &gt;95% of the total PCBs burden in blubber were efficiently extracted with a small volume (20 mL) of n-hexane using MAE due to simultaneous saponification and extraction. Further, the crude extract obtained by MAE was rapidly purified and automatically substituted to a small volume (1 mL) of toluene using SPD without using concentrators. Furthermore, the concentration of PCBs in the purified and concentrated solution was accurately determined by GC-ECD. Moreover, the result of accuracy test using a certified material (SRM 1588b; Cod liver oil) showed good agreement with the NIST certified concentration values. In addition, the method quantification limit of total-PCB in whale blubbers was 41 ng g-1. This new measurement system for PCBs takes only four hours. Consequently, it indicated this method is the most suitable for the monitoring and screening of PCBs in the conservation of the marine ecosystem and safe distribution of foods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study investigated the influence of age, dietary and trans-generational factors on the fate of major lipophilic chlorinated and brominated OHCs in adipose tissue of a potential surrogate captive species for the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), the sledge dog (Canis familiaris) in West Greenland. Adult female sledge dogs (P) and their sexually-mature (F1) and/or pre-weaning pups (F1-MLK) were divided into an exposed group (EXP) fed blubber from a Greenland minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and a control group (CON) given commercially available pork fat. Large dietary treatment-related differences in summed and individual congener/compound adipose tissue concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), chlordanes (CHLs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found between the EXP and CON groups for all the sledge dog cohorts. However, among the F1-MLK, F1 and P dogs in both of the EXP and CON groups, little or no difference existed in PBDE, HCB, CHL and PCB concentrations, suggesting higher state of equilibrium in adipose tissue concentrations from a very early stage of life. In contrast, the distribution pattern (proportions to the summed concentrations) of OHC classes, and the major congeners/compounds constituting those classes, varied on a dietary group- and/or cohort-dependent manner. The present captive sledge dog study demonstrated the importance of the confounding effects of diet composition, mother-pup association (maternal transfer), reproductive status (nursing), and to a lesser extent age in the fate of OHCs in adipose tissue of a large top carnivore mammal. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For femur, also biomechanical properties during bending (displacement [mm], load [N], energy absorption [J] and stiffness [N/mm]) were measured. Sixteen foxes (EXP) were fed a wet food containing 7.7% OC-polluted minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber in two periods of body fat deposition (Aug-Dec) and two periods of body fat mobilisation (Jan-July) in which the food contained less energy and only 2% blubber. ΣOC food concentration in the food containing 7.7% whale blubber was 309 ng/g wet mass. This corresponded to a ΣOC exposure of ca. 17 μg/kg body mass/d and a responding ΣOC residue in subcutaneous adipose tissue of ca. 1700 ng/g live mass in the 8 EXP fat foxes euthanized after 16 months. A control group (CON) composed of 15 foxes were fed equal daily caloric amounts of clean pork (Sus scrofa) fat. After 16 months, 8 EXP and 7 CON foxes were euthanized (mean body mass = 9.25 kg) while the remaining 8 EXP and 8 CON foxes were given restricted food rations for 6 months resulting in a body weight reduction (mean body mass = 5.46 kg). The results showed that only BMDskull vs. BMDvertebrae were significantly correlated (R = 0.68; p = 0.03; n = 10) probably due to a similar composition of trabecular and cortical osteoid tissue. No difference in any of the BMD measurements or femoral biomechanical properties was found between EXP and CON foxes although BMD baculum was 1.6-folds lower in the EXP group. However, lean summer foxes had significantly lower femoral biomechanical properties measured as displacement (mm), energy absorption (J) and time (s) biomechanical properties than fat winter foxes (all p &lt; 0.004). This indicates lower stiffness and softer bones from fasting which is in agreement with previous studies. Further, it should be kept in mind when studying bone tissues in Arctic mammals also in order to avoid confounding effects from body condition. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The associations between in vitro PCB metabolism, activity of oxidative hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and concentrations of PCBs and hydroxylated metabolites were investigated. The CON dogs exhibited a 2.3-fold higher depletion percentage for the PCB congeners having at least two pairs of vicinal meta-para Cl-unsubstituted carbons (PCB-18 and -33) relative to the EXP dogs. This depletion discrepancy suggests that there exist substrates in liver of the organohalogen-contaminated EXP dogs that can competitively bind and/or interfere with the active sites of CYP isoenzymes, leading to a lower metabolic efficiency for these PCBs. Testosterone (T) hydroxylase activity, determined via the formation of 6β-OH-T, 16α-OH-T, 16β-OH-T and androstenedione, was strongly correlated with the depletion percentages of PCB-18 and -33 in both cohorts. Based on documented hepatic microsomal CYP isoenzyme substrate specificities in canines, present associations suggest that primarily CYP2B/2C and CYP3A were inducible in sledge dogs and responsible for the in vitro metabolism of PCB-18 and -33. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Biotransformation; Cytochrome P450; Dogs; Hepatic microsomes; Hydroxylated metabolites; In vitro; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Testosterone hydroxylase","androstenedione; carbon; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 2B; cytochrome P450 2C; cytochrome P450 3A; cytochrome P450 isoenzyme; enzyme; ethoxyresorufin deethylase; organohalogen derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; testosterone hydroxylase; unclassified drug; unspecific monooxygenase; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; binding site; biotransformation; Canis familiaris; catalysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; diet; dog; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; female; in vitro study; liver microsome; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Canis familiaris",,"androstenedione, 26264-53-9, 63-05-8; carbon, 7440-44-0; cytochrome P450, 9035-51-2; cytochrome P450 2B, 334677-51-9; cytochrome P450 3A, 329322-82-9; ethoxyresorufin deethylase, 59793-97-4; unspecific monooxygenase, 9012-80-0, 9037-52-9, 9038-14-6",,,"Environment Canada

Patterns of variation in linked markers with slower rates of evolution can potentially be used to calibrate the rate of nucleotide substitution in the control region and to better understand the interplay of evolutionary and demographic forces across the mitochondrial genome above and below the species level. We have examined patterns of diversity within and between three baleen whale species (gray, humpback, and Antarctic minke whales) in order to determine how patterns of molecular evolution differ between cytochrome b and the control region. Our results show that cytochrome b is less variable than expected given the diversity in the control region for gray and humpback whales, even after functional differences are taken into account, but more variable than expected for minke whales. Differences in the frequency distributions of polymorphic sites and in best-fit models of nucleotide substitution indicate that these patterns may be the result of hypervariability in the control region in gray and humpback whales but, in minke whales, may result from a large, stable or expanding population size coupled with saturation at the control region. Using paired cytochrome b and control region data across individuals, we show that the average rate of nucleotide substitution in the control region may be on average 2.6 times higher than phylogenetically derived estimates in cetaceans. These results highlight the complexity of making inferences from control region data alone and suggest that applying simple rules of DNA sequence analyses across species may be difficult. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cetacea;

Regression analyses clearly showed that blubber thickness, girth and fat weight have been decreasing for nearly 2 decades. The decrease per year is estimated at approximately 0.02 cm for mid-lateral blubber thickness and 17 kg for fat weight, corresponding to 9% for both measurements over the 18-year period. Furthermore, ""date"", ""extent of diatom adhesion"", ""sex"", ""body length"", ""fetus length"", ""latitude"", ""age"" and ""longitude"" were all identified as partially independent predictors of blubber thickness. The direct interpretation of this substantial decline in energy storage in terms of food availability is difficult, since no long-term krill abundance series is available. However, an increase in the abundance of krill feeders other than minke whales and a resulting decrease in the krill population must be considered as a likely explanation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Antarctica; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Euphausia superba; Long-term change; Minke whale; Prey availability","bioenergetics; biological survey; fat reserve; prey availability; whale; Southern Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Patterns of lipid content and stratification in the blubber of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (1990) J Mamm, 71, pp. 544-554; Armstrong, A.J., Siegfried, W.R., Consumption of Antarctic krill by minke whales (1991) Ant Sci, 3, pp. 13-18; Atkinson, A., Siegel, V., Pakhomov, E., Rothery, P., Long-term decline in krill stock and increase in salps within the Southern Ocean (2004) Nature, 432, pp. 100-103; Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Hewitt, R.P., Siniff, D.B., Trivelpiece, W.Z., Clapham, P.J., Brownell Jr., L.B., (2006) Whales, Whaling and Ocean Ecosystems, pp. 215-230. , Estes A et al.

Box 160C, Campus, Concepción, Chile","Species, biomasses, production rates, distribution and other aspects of the community structure have been studied in the Antarctic Ecosystem; however there are no integrated models that explain mass transfer at the spatial mesoscale. Even though the Antarctic Ecosystem as a whole has been identified as a functional unit, subsystems could be identified and characterized, among which, the Antarctic Peninsula stands out for its particular geography, oceanography and trophic web. The aim of this work is to construct a mass balanced model describing the main trophic interactions of this community. The model is built using the software Ecopath with Ecosim 5.0, which yields a representation of the trophic web and estimations of global ecosystem properties. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill accounted for most of the mass flow. Flows to the trophic level II (TL II; detritivores and herbivores) were attributed to zooplanktonic and benthic organisms mainly. Flows to the TL III were explained by fish, birds (flying birds and penguins), Balaenoptera acutorostrata and baleen whales. Flows to the TL IV were dominated by some fish, birds (flying birds and penguins) and mammals. Finally, in TL VI, the flows were dominated by Orcinus orca. O. orca was the top predator in the ecosystem with a TL of 4.88, followed by Physeter catodon (4.63) and Hydrurga leptonyx (4.62). Krill was found at the intermediate TL (2.33). Resulting ecosystem indexes (e.g. total transfer efficiency, connectance index, etc.) were consistent and characteristic of ecosystems of high temporal and spatial variability. The model gives a comprehensive description of the food web dominated by phytoplankton-krill-top predators chain, and complemented with alternative food pathways (e.g. through Electrona antarctica), which together gives an enhanced complexity to the system. Despite the limitations of the model in data gaps, particularly for winter season, grouping of functional groups, steady state assumptions, etc., it improves the description of the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Antarctic Peninsula and highlights gaps in knowledge. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The survey covered the area between Cape Farewell and Disko Island on the West Greenland coast out to the 200m depth contour. The surveyed area covered 163,574km 2 and a total of 246 sightings of 9 cetacean species were obtained. Abundance estimates were developed for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (21 sightings), fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus (78 sightings) and common minke whales, B. acutorostrata (42 sightings). The mean group size of humpback whales was 3.30 but groups as large as 95 animals were seen off effort. The mean group size of fin whales was 2.96 with groups as large as 50 seen. Common minke whale group size was 1.1 with only one sighting of a group of two whales. Humpback whales were found both in offshore and coastal areas of West Greenland with the exception of Store Hellefiske Bank and the Cape Farewell offshore area. The line transect abundance estimate of humpback whales was 1, 218 (CV=0.56), uncorrected for submerged whales (availability bias) and whales that were available to be seen but were missed by the observers (perception bias). Fin whales were observed in all areas of the survey and the uncorrected line transect estimate was 1, 660 (CV=0.38). When corrected for perception bias the estimates increases to 3,234 fin whales (CV=0.44). Common minke whales were found in almost equal densities in all strata except for the Cape Farewell offshore area, where none were seen. The cue-counting abundance estimate of common minke whales was 4, 856 (CV=0.49) for West Greenland using a cue rate of 46.3 cues per hour (CV=0.11). If the estimate is corrected for perception bias the common minke whale abundance is estimated to be 10,792 whales (CV=0.59). Low coverage was attained in the northern area of West Greenland and this should cause an especially large negative bias for the estimates of fin whale and humpback whale abundance because this area is believed to have particularly large densities of these whales.","Abundance estimate; Common minke whale; Cue counting; Distribution; Fin whale; g(0); Humpback whale; Northern hemisphere; School size; Survey-Aerial; Survey-Vessel","abundance estimation; aerial survey; demographic survey; Northern Hemisphere; population density; spatial distribution; whale; Arctic; Cape Farewell; Disko Island; Egger Island; Greenland; West Greenland; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Bannister, J.L., Hedley, S.L., Southern Hemisphere group IV humpback whales: Their status from recent aerial survey (2001) Mem.

Box 11307, Banff, AB45 3WB Scotland, United Kingdom","Data on the distribution of northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the coastal waters of the southern outer Moray Firth in northeast Scotland were collected from May to October, 2000 to 2004 inclusive. During this period, 127 encounters with B. acutorostrata were recorded during systematic boat-based surveys. The encounters were subsequently converted to number of animals sighted per unit of survey effort (SPUE) for comparison with mesoscale oceanographic features. Using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, monthly composite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) were obtained. In the SST imagery two oceanographic features appeared to dominate the Moray Firth region: a cold water current and a warm water plume. The results show that the SPUE of B. acutorostrata was significantly higher during warm plume events than when the cold current was dominant (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0.0167). Levels of phytoplankton biomass also appeared to be substantially greater during warm water plume events. In conclusion, it is hypothesised that those areas of highest minke SPUE are directly related to the presence of targeted prey attracted by high densities of phytoplankton. Although these whales were found to occur across the survey area, throughout the study period, their distribution is concluded to be highly dependent upon the presence of co-occurring mesoscale features. These, as well as other physiographic environmental determinants, are all thought to be important in forming this heterogeneous coastal ecosystem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The present work reviews the current knowledge on cetaceans species and extends this knowledge with an analysis of cetaceans stranded in the Parnaiba Delta, on the coast of Maranhão State, Brazil. The studies on cetacean diversity on the coast of the Parnaíba Delta were made from August 2004 to August 2006. Fourteen strandings were reported, representing six distinct species, such as the estuarine dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni), dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), pigmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and two specimens which have not yet been identified. The significant degree of cetacean diversity in the region shows that the Parnaíba Delta is, possibly, of an important area for cetacean studies in Brasil.","Brazil; Cetacean; Maranhão; Parnaiba Delta; Stranding","animal; article; biodiversity; Brazil; Cetacea; classification; Animals; Biodiversity; Brazil; Cetacea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera edeni; Cetacea; Feresa attenuata; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Sotalia guianensis",,,,,,,"ALVES-JÚNIOR, T.T., ÁVILA, F.J.C., OLIVEIRA, J.A., FURTADO-NETO, M.A., MONTEIRO-NETO, C., Registro de cetáceos para o litoral do Estado do Ceará, Brasil (1996) Arq.

Church Street, West Chester, PA 19383, United States","Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are the smallest member of balaenopterid whales and little is known of their kinematics during feeding maneuvers. These whales have narrow and elongated flippers that are small relative to body size compared to related species such as right and gray whales. No experimental studies have addressed the hydrodynamic properties of minke whale flippers and their functional role during feeding maneuvers. This study integrated wind tunnel, locomotion and anatomical range of motion data to identify functional parameters of the cambered minke whale flipper. A full-sized cast of a minke whale flipper was used in wind tunnel testing of lift, drag and stall behavior at six speeds, corresponding to swimming speeds of 0.7-8.9 m s-1. Flow over the model surface stalled between 10° and 14° angle of attack (α) depending on testing speed. When the leading edge was rotated ventrally, loss in lift occurred around -18° α regardless of speed. Range of mobility in the fresh limb was approximately 40% greater than the range of positive lift-generating angles of attack predicted by wind tunnel data (+14° α). Video footage, photographs and observations of swimming, engulfment feeding and gulping minke whales showed limb positions corresponding to low drag in wind tunnel tests, and were therefore hydrodynamically efficient. Flippers play an important role in orienting the body during feeding maneuvers as they maintain trim of the body, an action that counters drag-induced torque of the body during water and prey intake.","Cetacea; Control surface; Engulfment; Feeding; Flipper; Forelimb; Hydrodynamics; Lunge; Wind tunnel","animal; article; audiovisual equipment; biomechanics; biophysics; comparative study; feeding behavior; histology; limb; minke whale; physiology; swimming; videorecording; Animals; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Extremities; Feeding Behavior; Minke Whale; Models, Anatomic; Swimming; Video Recording; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae",,,,,,,"Arnold, P.W., Birtles, R.A., Sobtzick, S., Matthews, M., Dunstan, A., Gulping behavior in rorqual whales: Underwater observations and functional interpretation (2005) Mem.

Serological and pathological studies were conducted on Brucella spp. in the western North Pacific using samples from three whale species collected during 2000 under the second phase of the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Western North Pacific (JARPN II). Serum samples from 40 common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), 43 Bryde's whales (B. edeni) and 4 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were assessed with agglutination testing designed for B. abortus detection. Brucella-specific serum antibodies were detected in 38% of common minke whale samples. A lower prevalence (9%) of the antibody was observed for the Bryde's whale samples, whereas no specific antibody against Brucella was observed for the four sperm whales. Serum samples from 104 Antarctic minke whales (B. bonaerensis) collected under the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic (JARPA) were analysed, and no Brucella-specific antibodies were detected. Granular lesions with caseation and mineralisation were found in 35% (13 males and one female) of 40 minke whale gonads. Similar lesions were also observed in the gonads of one male and one female Bryde's whale. These gonad lesions were not found in 440 Antarctic minke whales and five sperm whales, despite the thorough examination conducted for reproduction studies. Histopathological studies showed that the lesions consisted of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells and had an infiltration of lymphocytes. DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using specific primers from ten of 22 abnormal testis tissues collected from common minke whales. The DNA sequences had IS711 transposable elements downstream of bp26, characteristic of marine strains of Brucella spp. The gene structure of omp2, and specific PCR products for seal strains, showed similarity to Atlantic seal strains rather than Atlantic whale strains. This showed that classification based on marine mammal host species, B. cetacea and B. pinippedia is not appropriate. Considering the zoonotic nature of the genus Brucella, the crews and researchers who have had frequent contact with whales were serologically examined and were found to have no health issues associated with this agent. No Brucella-specific antibody was detected in the sera from 51 persons examined in 2001, nor from 103 examined issues in 2003.","Antarctic minke whale; Antarctic Ocean; Biomarkers; Bryde's whale; Common minke whale; Diseases, Brucella; Genetics; Immunology; Jarpa; Jarpnii; Pacific Ocean; Reproduction; Scientific permits; Sperm whale; Survey-vessel","antibody; detection method; DNA; female; genetic analysis; genetic structure; histopathology; male; reproduction; research; sperm; whale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenoptera edeni; Brucella; Brucella melitensis biovar Abortus; Cetacea; Halichoerus grypus; Mammalia; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Aguirre, A.A., Keefe, T., Reif, J.S., Kashinsky, L., Yochem, P.K., Saliki, J.T., Stott, J.L., Antonelis, G., Infectious disease monitoring of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (2007) J.

Total toxaphene and ΣCHB (sum of 11 chlorobornanes) concentrations in blubber samples ranged from 170 ± 110 and 41 ± 39 ng/g lipid weight (l.w.) for female minke whales from southeastern Greenland to 5800 ± 4100 and 1100 ± 780 ng/g l.w. for males from the North Sea, respectively. Very large variations in toxaphene concentrations among sampling areas were observed suggesting a spatial segregation of minke whales. However, much of the apparent geographical discrimination was explained by the seasonal fluctuation of animal fat mass. Patterns of CHBs in males revealed that recalcitrant CHBs were in higher proportions in animals from the more easterly areas than in animals from the more westerly areas. This trend may be influenced by the predominance of the US, over the European, input of toxaphene to North Atlantic waters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first dedicated cetacean survey of this area, monthly boat-based surveys were carried out over 1 year (April 2004 to March 2005) both within the Sanctuary and seawards in deeper offshore waters. The survey established that the Sanctuary has year-round abundance of cetaceans. Eight species were observed, including three species of large whales. Live sightings of Sousa chinensis in this area were documented for the first time in Sri Lanka, as were the first live sightings of Kogia sima and Peponocephala electra off the west coast of the island. This area appears to be an important habitat for Balaenoptera acutorostrata in Sri Lanka's waters. Several threats to marine mammals were also identified and some were found to be localized and specific to this area. The results of this study were used to produce a set of management recommendations. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.","Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary; Cetaceans; Marine mammals; Sousa chinensis; Sri Lanka","abundance; cetacean; conservation management; coral reef; demographic survey; marine park; species conservation; species occurrence; Asia; Bar Reef; Eurasia; North Western Province [Sri Lanka]; South Asia; Sri Lanka; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Kogia simus; Mammalia; Peponocephala electra; Sousa chinensis",,,,,,,"ALLING, A., Records of Odontocetes in the Northern Indian Ocean (1981-1982) and off the coast of Sri Lanka (1982-1984) (1986) Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 83, pp. 376-394; ALLING, A., GORDON, J., ROTTON, N., WHITEHEAD, H., WWF-Netherlands Indian Ocean Sperm Whale Study, 1981-1982 (1982) Interim report, , WWF, Zeist, Netherlands; DAYARATNE, P., JOSEPH, L., (1993) A Study on Dolphin Catches in Sri Lanka, , Bay of Bengal Programme, Madras, India; DAYARATNE, P., LINDEN, O., DE SILVA, R., (1997) The Puttalam/Mundel Estuarine System and Associated Coastal Waters in Sri Lanka, , NARA, Colombo, Sri Lanka; DE SILVA, P.H.D.H., Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) recorded off Sri Lanka, India, from the Arabian Sea and Gulf, Gulf of Aden and from the Red Sea (1987) Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 84, pp. 505-525; ILANGAKOON, A., Species composition, seasonal variation, sex ratio and body length of small cetaceans caught off the west, south-west and south coasts of Sri Lanka (1997) Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 94, pp. 298-306; ILANGAKOON, A., (2002) Whales and Dolphins of Sri Lanka: A Guide to the Cetaceans in the Waters around Sri Lanka, , WHT Publications, Colombo, Sri Lanka; ILANGAKOON, A.D., Taxonomy and current status of marine mammals in Sri Lanka (2006) The Fauna in Sri Lanka: Status of Taxonomy, Research and Conservation, pp. 302-308. , ed.

Blood plasma and urine clinical-chemical parameters were measured and compared between the bitches and pups form the control and exposed cohorts. Based on existing reference intervals, Arctic mammals may have blood clinical-chemical endpoint levels that differ from comparable species at lower latitudes. The cortisol:creatinine ratio, protein:creatinine ratio, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and inorganic phosphate were significantly highest (ANCOVA: all p < 0.05) in the pup generation. The cortisol:creatinine ratio, cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase were significantly higher (ANCOVA: all p < 0.05) in the control group, while glucose was significantly highest (ANCOVA: p < 0.05) in the exposed group. Furthermore, the blood cholesterol levels indicate that exposure via the diet to marine mammal blubber has a preventive effect on the development of cardiovascular diseases. We therefore suggest that the consumption of contaminated Arctic marine blubber impacted liver and kidney function in adult and pup sledge dogs. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This process is mediated by urea transporters (UTs) encoded by two genes, UT-A (Slc14a2) and UT-B (Slc14a1). Our previous study demonstrated that cetaceans produce highly concentrated urine than terrestrial mammals, and that baleen whales showed higher concentrations of urinary urea than sperm whales. Therefore, we hypothesized that cetaceans have unique actions of UTs to maintain fluid homeostasis in marine habitat. Kidney samples of common minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), sei (B. borealis), Bryde's (B. brydei) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were obtained to determine the nucleotide sequences of mRNAs encoding UT. The sequences of 2.5-kb cDNAs encode 397-amino acid proteins, which are 90-94% identical to the mammalian UT-A2s. Two putative glycosylation sites are conserved between the whales and the terrestrial mammals, whereas consensus sites for protein kinases are not completely conserved; only a single protein kinase A consensus site was identified in the whale UT-A2s. Two protein kinase C consensus sites are present in the baleen whale UT-A2s, however, a single protein kinase C consensus site was identified in the sperm whale UT-A2. These different phosphorylation sites of whale UT-A2s may result in the high concentrations of urinary urea in whales, by reflecting their urea permeability. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In the present comparative study, we used a potential surrogate Canoidea species for the East Greenland polar bear, the captive sledge dog (Canis familiaris), to investigate some factors that may influence the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of major chlorinated and brominated OHCs in adipose tissue and blood (plasma) of control (fed commercial pork fat) and exposed (fed West Greenland minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber) adult female sledge dogs. Furthermore, we compared the patterns and concentrations of OHCs and their known or suggested hydroxylated (OH) metabolites (e.g., OH-PCBs) in sledge dogs with those in adipose tissue and blood (plasma) of East Greenland adult female polar bears, and blubber of their main prey species, the ringed seal (Pusa hispida). The two-year feeding regime conducted with sledge dogs led to marked differences in overall adipose tissue (and plasma) OHC residue accumulation between the control and exposed groups. Characteristic prey-to-predator OHC bioaccumulation dynamics for major PCB and PBDE congeners (patterns and concentrations) and biotransformation capacity with respect to PCB metabolite formation and OH-PCB retention distinguished, to some extent, captive sledge dogs and wild polar bears. Based on the present findings, we conclude that the use of surrogate species in toxicological investigations for species in the Canoidea family should be done with great caution, although they remain essential in the context of contaminants research with sensitive arctic top carnivore species such as the polar bear. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The prevalence of portal fibrosis, mild bile duct hyperplasia, and vascular leukocyte infiltrations was significantly higher in the exposed group (all Chi-square: p<0.05). In case of granulomas, the frequency was significantly highest in the bitches (P generation) while the prevalence of portal fibrosis was highest in the F generation (pups) (both Chi-square: p<0.05). No significant difference between exposed and controls was found for bile acid, ALAT, and ALKP, while ASAT and LDH were significantly highest in the control group (both ANOVA: p<0.05). We therefore suggest that a daily intake of 50-200 g environmentally organohalogen polluted minke whale blubber can cause liver lesions in Greenland sledge dogs.

For that purpose, we measured BMD (bone mineral density) by DXA scanning (g/cm- 2) in 15 age and weight normalized sledge dog (Canis familiaris) bitches and their 26 pups divided into a control group (n = 26) given 50-200 g/day clean pork (Suis scrofa) fat and a treated group (n = 15) given 50-200 g/day OHC polluted minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber as main lipid sources. The results showed that BMD increased significantly with age (linear regression: p &lt; 0.0001, r2 = 0.83, n = 41) while no sex difference was found in the F-generation (two-way ANOVA: all p &gt; 0.3). No differences in BMDfemur or BMDvertebrae between exposed and control individuals in the bitch generation were found (linear mixed effect model: both p &gt; 0.38). Likewise, no difference between exposed and control subadults and juveniles in the F-generation was found (two-way ANOVA: all p &gt; 0.33). Correlation analyses between BMDfemur, BMDvertebrae and groups of OHCs, respectively, did not show any statistically significant relationships nor a clear or decreasing trend (Pearson's: p: 0.07-0.78; r: - 0.2-0.59; n: 10-18). As the groups were similar regarding genetics, age and sex are the only factors that can explain this observation. Either the pollutants did not have an impact on BMD using the present time frame and OHC concentrations (threshold levels not reached), or the difference in food composition (mainly vitamins and n3 fatty acids) conceal the potential OHC impact on BMD. Such information is important when evaluating the positive and negative health consequences from eating polluted marine species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Follicular oocytes recovered from the follicles were also used for measurement of oocyte diameter after removing the cumulus cells. The mean diameter of the ooplasm in the oocytes from the large follicles (143.2 μm) was significantly greater than those from the small (127.1 μm) and medium (131.7 μm) follicles, although there were no significant differences in diameter of the whole oocyte and thickness of the zona pellucida among the three follicular sizes. The osmolarity of the follicular fluid from the small follicles (363.3 mOsmol) was significantly lower than that of the medium follicles (388.9 mOsmol) and tended to be lower than that of large (381.9 mOsmol) follicles, respectively, both of which were similar to that of the umbilical serum (379.5 mOsmol). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of all components of the follicular fluid between the medium and large follicles. As compared with the values of the umbilical serum, the total-protein, glucose, albumin and chlorine concentrations of the follicular fluid from the medium and large follicles were significantly higher, and the total cholesterol and calcium concentrations were significantly lower. The concentrations of lactic acid (85.3-136.0 mg/dl) of the follicular fluid from the three groups of follicles were significantly lower than that of the umbilical serum (360.0 mg/dl). Among the follicles, the follicular fluid from the small follicles (136.0 mg/dl) contained a significantly higher concentration of lactic acid than that from the large follicles (85.3 mg/dl). The progesterone concentrations were not significantly different among the fluid from the three group of follicles and the umbilical serum: however, the estradiol 17-β concentrations of the follicular fluid increased with the size of the follicle (14.3 and 34.6 ng/ml for small and large follicles, respectively). These results offer new information concerning whale reproductive physiology, especially for improvement of in vitro oocyte maturation and related technologies in whales.","Follicle size; Follicular fluid;

Extant cetaceans have a soft tissue flipper encasing the manus and acting as a hydrofoil to generate lift. The neuromuscular anatomy that controls flipper movement, however, is poorly understood. This study documents flipper neuro-muscular anatomy and tests the hypothesis that antebrachial muscle robustness is related to body size. Data were gathered during dissections of 22 flippers, representing 15 species (7 odontocetes, 15 mysticetes). Results were compared with published descriptions of both artiodactyls and secondarily aquatic vertebrates. Results indicate muscle robustness is best predicted by taxonomic distribution and is not a function of body size. All cetaceans have atrophied triceps muscles, an immobile cubital joint, and lack most connective tissue structures and manus muscles. Forelimbs retain only three muscle groups: triceps (only the scapular head is functional as the humeral heads are vestigal), and antebrachial extensors and flexors. Well-developed flexor and extensor muscles were found in mysticetes and basal odontocetes (i.e., physeterids, kogiids, and ziphiids), whereas later diverging odontocetes (i.e., monodontids, phocoenids, and delphinids) lack or reduce these muscles. Balaenopterid mysticetes (e.g., fin and minke whales) may actively change flipper curvature, while basal odontocetes (e.g., sperm and beaked whales) probably stiffen the flipper through isometric contraction. Later diverging odontocetes lack musculature supporting digital movements and are unable to manipulate flipper curvature. Cetacean forelimbs are unique in that they have lost agility and several soft tissue structures, but retain sensory innervations.

Mammalian OR genes had diverged greatly in the terrestrial environment after the fish-tetrapod split, indicating their importance to land habitation. In this study, we analysed OR genes of marine tetrapods (minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata, dwarf sperm whale Kogia sima, Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli, Steller's sea lion Eumetopias jubatus and loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta) and revealed that the pseudogene proportions of OR gene repertoires in whales were significantly higher than those in their terrestrial relative cattle and also in sea lion and sea turtle. On the other hand, the pseudogene proportion of OR sequences in sea lion was not significantly higher compared with that in their terrestrial relative (dog). It indicates that secondary perfectly adapted marine vertebrates (cetaceans) have lost large amount of their OR genes, whereas secondary-semi-adapted marine vertebrates (sea lions and sea turtles) still have maintained their OR genes, reflecting the importance of terrestrial environment for these animals. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Cetacea; Marine and terrestrial environment; Olfactory receptor; Sea lion; Sea turtle; Secondary-adapted marine vertebrates","adaptation; cetacean; divergence; gene expression; marine ecosystem; olfactory cue; turtle; animal tissue; article; Cetacea; dog; minke whale; multigene family; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; porpoise; priority journal; pseudogene; seal; species comparison; sperm whale; animal; cattle; DNA sequence; female; genetics; male; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; porpoise; pseudogene; turtle; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Bos; Canis familiaris; Caretta; Caretta caretta; Cetacea; Cheloniidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Kogia simus; Mammalia; Otariidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Tetrapoda; Vertebrata; Animals; Base Sequence; Cattle; Dogs; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phylogeny; Porpoises; Pseudogenes; Receptors, Odorant; Sea Lions; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Turtles; Whales","GENBANK: AB301617, AB301618, AB301619, AB301620, AB301621","Receptors, Odorant",,,,,"Ache, B.W., Young, J.M., Olfaction: Diverse species, conserved principles (2005) Neuron, 48, pp. 417-430; Beets, M., The molecular parameters of olfactory response (1970) Pharm.

Territ. 4810, Australia","Changes in the relative abundance of marine megafauna (whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles, manta rays, dugongs) from aerial survey sightings in the waters adjacent to Ningaloo Reef between June 2000 and April 2002 are described. Generalised linear models were used to explore relationships between different trophic guilds of animals (based on animal sighting biomass estimates) and biophysical features of the oceanscape that were likely to indicate foraging habitats (regions of primary/secondary production) including sea surface temperature (SST), SST gradient, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), bathymetry (BTH) and bathymetry gradient (BTHg). Relative biomass of krill feeders (i.e. minke whales, whale sharks, manta rays) were related to SST, Chl-a and bathymetry (model [AICc] weight ≤ 0.45) and the model combining these variables explained a relatively large amount (32.3%) of the variation in relative biomass. Relative biomass of fish/cephalopod feeders (dolphins, sharks) were weakly correlated with changes in SST, whereas that of other invertebrate/macroalgal feeders (turtles, dugong) was weakly correlated with changes in steepness of the shelf (bathymetry gradient). Our results indicate that biophysical variables describe only a small proportion of the variance in the relative abundance and biomass of marine megafauna at Ningaloo reef. © CSIRO 2007.","Aerial surveys; Chlorophyll-a; Marine megafauna; Ningaloo Reef; Sea surface temperature","aerial survey; bathymetric survey; biomass; chlorophyll a; crustacean; feeding ground; guild; ichthyofauna; relative abundance; sea surface temperature; trophic structure; variance analysis; Australasia; Australia; Ningaloo Reef; Western Australia; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Chondrichthyes; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mobulinae; Rhincodontidae; Testudines",,,,,,,"Agenbag, J.J., Richardson, A.J., Demarcq, H., Freon, P., Weeks, S., Shillington, F.A., Estimating environmental preferences of South African pelagic fish species using catch size and remote sensing data (2003) Progress in Oceanography, 59, pp. 275-300. , doi:10.1016/J.POCEAN.2003. 07.004; Ainley, D.G., Speara, L.B., Tynanb, C.T., Barthc, J.A., Piercec, S.D., Fordd, R.G., Cowles, T.J., Physical and biological variables affecting seabird distributions during the upwelling season of the northern California Current (2005) Deep-Sea Research.

In Experiment 1, we attempted to determine the appropriate culture duration (30 or 40 h) for in vitro maturation (IVM) of immature oocytes using the Well of the Well method. In Experiment 2, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was applied to matured oocytes from prepubertal and adult common minke whales after IVM culture (40 or 48 h), and then their embryonic development was assessed. In Experiment 1, the maturation rate of oocytes cultured for 40 h (30.4%) was significantly higher than that of oocytes cultured for 30 h (6.8%; P<0.01). In Experiment 2, a total of 35 and 46 immature oocytes derived from adult (n=2) and prepubertal (n=6) minke whales, respectively, were cultured for 40 or 48 h. The maturation rate in the oocytes from the adult whales (34.2%) tended to be higher than that of the oocytes from the prepubertal whales (19.6%), but there was no significant difference. Following ICSI, 3 out of the 10 inseminated and cultured oocytes from the adult whales cleaved (2-, 8-, and 16-cell stages); all of these oocytes had been matured for 40 in culture. However, these oocytes did not develop to further stages. Only one of the 6 oocytes derived from the prebuertal whales, IVM cultured for 40 h and inseminated, developed to the 4-cell stage. The present results indicate that a 40 h IVM culture produces significantly higher rates of in vitro maturation than a 30 h IVM culture for common minke whale oocytes. Following ICSI, some oocytes cleaved to the 16-cell stage, but no further development was observed.","In vitro maturation (IVM); Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); Minke whale","age; animal; animal disease; article; cytology; female; fertilization in vitro; in vitro study; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; minke whale; oocyte; physiology; Age Factors; Animals; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Minke Whale; Oocytes; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Factors affecting in vitro maturation of minke whale (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Biol Reprod, 56, pp. 523-528; Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., In vitro fertilization of in vitro matured minke whale (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Mar Mam Sci, 13, pp. 395-404; Asada, M., Tetsuka, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Improvement on in vitro maturation, fertilization and development of minke whale (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 521-533; Iwayama, H., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Attempt at in vitro maturation of minke whale (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) oocytes using a portable CO2 incubator (2005) J Reprod Dev, 51, pp. 69-75; Iwayama, H., Hochi, S., Kato, M., Hirabayashi, M., Kuwayama, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Effects of cryodevice type and donor's sexual maturity on vitrification of minke whale (Balaenopetra bonaerensis) oocytes at germinal vesicle stage (2004) Zygote, 12, pp. 333-338; Fujihira, T., Kobayashi, M., Hochi, S., Hirabayashi, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Developmental capacity of Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) vitrified oocyres following in vitro maturation, and parthenogenetic activation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (2006) Zygote, 14, pp. 89-95; Vajita, G., Peura, T.T., Holm, P., Paldi, A., Greve, T., Trounson, A.O., Callesen, H., New method for culture of zona-included or zona-free embryos; the Well of the Well (WOW) system (2000) Mol Reprod Dev, 55, pp. 256-264; Perrin, W.F., Brownell Jr., R.L., Update of the list of recognized species of cetacean (2001) J Cettacean Res Manage Suppl, 3, pp. 364-365; Mogoe, T., Fukui, Y., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Morphological obserbvations of frozen-thawed spermatozoa of southern minke whales (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) (1998) J Reprod Dev, 44, pp. 95-100; Taka, M., Iwayama, H., Fukui, Y., Effect of the Well of the Well (WOW) system on in vitro culture for porcine embryos after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (2005) J Reprod Dev, 51, pp. 533-537; Kamiya, C., Kobayashi, M., Fukui, Y., In vitro culture using chemically defined media for in vitro matured and intracytoplasmically inseminated porcine oocytes (2006) J Reprod Dev, 52, pp. 625-632; Revel, F., Mermillod, P., Peynot, N., Renard, J.P., Heyman, Y., Low developmental capacity of in vitro matured and fertilized oocytes from calves compared with that of cows (1995) J Reprod Fertil, 103, pp. 115-120; Khatir, H., Lonergan, P., Mermillod, P., Kinetics of nuclear maturation and protein profiles of oocytes from prepubertal and adult cattle in vitro maturation (1998) Theriogenology, 50, pp. 917-929; Gandolfi, F., Milamesi, E., Pocar, P., Luciano, A.M., Brevini, T.A.L., Acocclla, F., Comparative analysis of calf and cow oocytes during in vitro maturation (1998) Mol Reprod Dev, 49, pp. 168-175; Damiani, P., Fissore, R.A., Gibelli, J.B., Long, C.R., Balise, J.J., Robl, J.M., Duby, R.T., Evaluation of developmental competence, nuclear and ooplasmic maturation of calf oocytes (1996) Mol Reprod Dev, 45, pp. 521-534; Driancurt, M.A., Reynaud, K., Smith, J., Differences in follicular function of 3-month-old calves and mature cows (2001) Reproduction, 121, pp. 463-474; Fujihira, T., Kinoshita, M., Sasaki, M., Onishi, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Comparative studies on lipid analysis and ultrastructure in porcine and southern minke whale (Balaenopetra acutorostrata) oocytes (2004) J Reprod Dev, 50, pp. 525-532; Ikumi, S., Sawai, K., Takeuchi, Y., Iwayama, H., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer for in vitro production of Antarctic minke whale (Balaenopetra bonaerensis) embryos (2004) Cloning and Stem Cells, 6, pp. 254-263","Fukui, Y.; Laboratory of Animal Reproduction, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro 080-8555, Japan; email: fukui@obihiro.ac.jp",,,,,,,,09168818,,,"17510529","English","J.

Their consumption of commercial species may present an economic problem for the local fishery. In order to estimate this consumption and understand the potential consequences for prey dynamics, it is essential to determine the multispecies functional response of the whales. The parameterisation of a functional response requires measurements of consumption rates and prey availability. In this localised study, undigested stomach contents were used to assess the amount of each prey that had been consumed immediately prior to capture. To determine the availability of prey to the whales, standard acoustic surveys were run in the same area within 2 d of the capture of the whales. The spatial distribution of prey was modelled using generalised additive models (GAMs). In order to generate a measure of prey availability and the uncertainty in this value, a simple model was assumed for whale movement, and prey abundance was sampled over space according to a Gaussian kernel. A multispecies functional response (MSFR) model was then fitted to the consumption and prey availability data using Bayesian methods. Simple simulations, based on the fitted MSFR, indicate that minke whales may deplete local capelin aggregations at small spatial scales. This is the first time that a multispecies functional response has been fitted for a cetacean predator, and the methods outlined here may prove useful for modelling marine mammal-fish interactions in other systems. © Inter-Research 2007.","Baleonoptera acutorostrata; Barents Sea; Functional response; Generalist predator; Minke whale","commercial species; foraging behavior; functional response; prey availability; whale; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Clupeidae; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mallotus (fish); Mallotus villosus; Mammalia; Thysanoessa",,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Is predator-mediated coexistence possible in unstable systems?

However, our research suggests that they are more common than previously considered. In spring 2005, a combined visual-acoustic survey of cetaceans in Hawaiian waters resulted in the sighting of a minke whale within 22 km of Kaua'i. Minke whale vocalizations were also detected at several other locations near Kaua'i and O'ahu. These 2005 reports are the first from nearshore (<50 km) Hawaiian waters despite years of previous shipboard and aerial surveys. The lack of historical sightings is likely due to misidentification or the inability to detect these animals during poor sighting conditions. We recommend that future cetacean surveys in Hawaiian waters include a passive acoustic component to increase the likelihood of detecting minke whales. © 2007 by University of Hawai'i Press.

The impact from dietary intake of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber high in organohalogen and other chemical contaminants on renal morphology and function was investigated via a controlled study on West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris). Our results showed significantly higher frequencies of glomerular, tubular, and interstitial lesions in the exposed group. Furthermore, higher urine protein : creatinine ratio and plasma urea levels were found in the exposed group, which indicated a negative impact on kidney function via tubular and glomerular dysfunctions. The lesions were similar to those observed in top predator marine species-such as seals and polar bears-and humans exposed via diet to persistent environmental pollutants. The lesions may have impacts on the overall health of these animals. It is reasonable to suggest that chronic exposure to organic pollutants via a country diet of high trophic level marine organisms may have an impact on renal morphology and function in Arctic apex predators in general as well as Inuit people. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Captive cohorts; Kidney; Mercury; Minke whale blubber; Organochlorine pesticides; PBDEs; PCBs; Renal morphology; Sledge dogs; West Greenland","Captive cohorts; Minke whale blubber; Organochlorine pesticides; West Greenlands; Biological organs; Ethane; Impurities; Morphology; Mammals; canid; DDT; diet; lesion; mercury (element); organic pollutant; organochlorine; PBDE; PCB; pesticide; pollution effect; pollution exposure; trophic level; whale; Arctic; Greenland; West Greenland; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Canis familiaris; Mammalia; Ursus maritimus",,,,,"Lundbeckfonden

Capture-recapture analyses of market products using DNA profiling have the potential to estimate the total number of individuals entering the market. However, these analyses are not directly analogous to those of living individuals because a 'market individual' does not die suddenly but, instead, remains available for a time in decreasing quantities, rather like the exponential decay of a radioactive isotope. Here we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and microsatellite genotypes to individually identify products from North Pacific minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata ssp.) purchased in 12 surveys of markets in the Republic of (South) Korea from 1999 to 2003. By applying a novel capture-recapture model with a decay rate parameter to the 205 unique DNA profiles found among 289 products, we estimated that the total number of whales entering trade across the five-year survey period was 827 (SE, 164; CV, 0.20) and that the average 'half-life' of products from an individual whale on the market was 1.82 months (SE, 0.24; CV, 0.13). Our estimate of whales in trade (reflecting the true numbers killed) was significantly greater than the officially reported bycatch of 458 whales for this period. This unregulated exploitation has serious implications for the survival of this genetically distinct coastal population. Although our capture-recapture model was developed for specific application to the Korean whale-meat markets, the exponential decay function could be modified to improve the estimates of trade in other wildmeat or fisheries markets or abundance of living populations by noninvasive genotyping. © 2007 The Authors.","Capture-recapture; Fisheries bycatch; IUU exploitation; Microsatellites; Minke whales","microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; DNA fingerprinting; food industry; genetic variability; genetics; human; meat; methodology; minke whale; review; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fisheries; Humans; Meat; Microsatellite Repeats; Minke Whale; Variation (Genetics); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,"DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,,"(2001), http://www.maff.go.jp/mud/410.html, Anonymous (.)

Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common bottle-nosed dolphin neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalu) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales. Similar structures were present in the corresponding cardiac tissues of neonatal Hippopotamidae. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Fetus; Heart; Hippopotamidae; Mysticeti; Neonate; Odontoceti; Whale","anatomical variation; animal tissue; article; Balaena mysticetus; balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; comparative anatomy; controlled study; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinus delphis; dolphin; fetus; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; heart atrium septum; heart foramen ovale; heart ventricle septum; Hyperoodon ampullatus; killer whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; microscopic anatomy; Monodon monoceros; Neophocoena phocoenoides; newborn; nonhuman; Phocoena phocoena; porpoise; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; species comparison; species difference; tursiops truncatus; whale; Animals; Cetacea; Common Dolphins; Female; Heart Septum; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Porpoises; Whales; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinapterus leucas; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hippopotamidae; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monodon; Monodon monoceros; Monodontidae; Mysticeti; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Odontoceti; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Amoroso, E.C., Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., Prichard, M.M.L., The bifurcation of the posterior caval channel in the eutherian foetal heart (1942) J Anat, 76, pp. 240-247; (2005) Out of the Blue: The UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme, , History Museum London; Arnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 333, pp. 27-34; Barclay, A.E., Franklin, K.J., The time of functional closure of the foramen ovale in the lamb (1938) J Physiol, 94, pp. 256-258; Bartholin, T., (1654) Historiarum Anatomicarum Rariorum Centuriae II; Historia XXV, , Amstelodami; Beauregard, H., Boulart, R., Recherches anatomiques sur les Balænides (1897) Nouv Arch Mus Hist Nat Paris 3rd Ser, 9, pp. 95-112; Boisserie, J.R., The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): A review based on morphology and cladistic analysis (2005) Zool J Linn Soc, 143, pp. 1-26; Boyd, I.L., Lockyer, C., Marsh, H.D., Reproduction in marine mammals (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 218-286. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Burmeister, G., Descripcion de cuatro especies de delfinides de la costa Argentina en el océano atlántico (1869) An Mus Nac Hist Nat B Aires, 1, pp. 367-442; Butler, P.J., Metabolic regulation in diving birds and mammals (2004) Resp Physiol Neurobiol, 141, pp. 297-315; Cohen, A.L., Critical point drying principles and procedures (1979) Scanning Electron Microscopy, 1979 (2), pp. 303-323; Echlin, P., Splutter coating techniques for scanning electron microscopy (1975) Scanning Electron Microsc, 1975 (2), pp. 217-224; Edelstone, D.I., Rudolph, A.M., Preferential streaming of ductus venosus blood to the brain and heart in fetal lambs (1979) Am J Physiol, 237, pp. H724-H729; Elsner, R., Living in water: Solutions to physiological problems (1999) Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 73-116. , In (eds Reynolds JE, III Rommel SA), Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press; Eschricht, D.F., (1837) De Organis, Quae Respirationi Et Nutritioni Foetus Mammalium Inserviunt, , Hafniae: JH Schultz; Eschricht, D.F., Zoologisch-anatomisch-physiologische Untersuchungen über die nordischen Walthiere (1849), L.

We conducted a controlled generational study on liver tissue and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood cytokine and acute-phase protein (APP) mRNA expressions using reverse transcriptionase-polymerase chain reaction in West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris); contaminated minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber serves as dietary pollutant source. Two of seven blood cytokine expressions (IL-6 and IL-12) and three of five APP expressions (haptoglobin [HP], heat shock protein, and fatty acid-binding protein [FABP]) were lowest in the exposed group, whereas the remaining five blood cytokine expressions (IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TGF-β) and two APP expressions (MT1 and MT2) were highest in the exposed group. In liver tissue, three cytokine expressions (IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and two APP expressions (MT1 and MT2) were highest in the exposed group, and the remaining cytokine and APP expressions were lowest in the exposed group. Of these, the liver tissue expression of HP and FABP was significantly lowest in the exposed group (both p < 0.05). As a consequence of our findings, we suggest that a daily intake of 50 to 200 g polluted whale blubber is associated with a genotoxic decrease in HP and FABP gene expression in the liver of sledge dog and possibly of other top mammalian marine predators and consumers in the Arctic, indicating a restricted acute-phase reaction and insufficient immune response. Finally, HP and FABP liver expression appear to be new and sensitive biomarkers of organohalogen compound exposure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"acute phase protein; cytokine; edetic acid; fatty acid binding protein; gamma interferon; haptoglobin; heat shock protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; organohalogen derivative; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; biomarker; canid; DDT; food intake; gene expression; genotoxicity; immune response; organic pollutant; PCB; pollutant source; pollution effect; pollution exposure; polymerase chain reaction; protein; whale; animal experiment; animal tissue; Arctic; article; controlled study; dog; female; gene expression; genetic transcription; genotoxicity; immune response; liver; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pollutant; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; whale; Acute-Phase Proteins; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biological Markers; Cytokines; Diet; Dogs; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Greenland; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Liver; Mercury; Minke Whale; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls; RNA, Messenger; Transcription, Genetic; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Canis familiaris; Cetacea; Mammalia","GENBANK: AB042265, AB075027, AF091134, AF126247, AF492467, AJ271156, AJ388530, AJ489256, BC031758, BC070299, D84397, L34956, M13003, M36271, M60316, NM_017370, U97485, X76916, X97260, XM_536799","edetic acid, 150-43-6, 60-00-4; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; haptoglobin, 9087-69-8; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; Acute-Phase Proteins; Biological Markers; Cytokines; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Mercury, 7439-97-6; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls; RNA, Messenger",,,,,"Ait-Aissa, S., Porcher, J.M., Arrigo, A.P., Lambre, C., Activation of the hsp70 promoter by environmental inorganic and organic chemicals: Relationships with cytotoxicity and lipophilicity (2000) Toxicology, 145, pp. 147-157; (2004) Persistent Organic Pollutants in the Arctic.

Chávez 302, Pucusana, Peru","In many developing countries, the killing of wild animals for commercial purposes (the bushmeat trade) is a significant factor in the reduction of biodiversity, and probably represents a major threat to the survival of many more populations than we know. This includes marine species such as cetaceans, sea turtles and sirenians ('marine bushmeat'), which are often neglected in the discussion of this issue. Estimating the impact of the bushmeat trade anywhere is problematic because even the most thorough visual surveys of meat markets cannot easily translate an observed quantity of butchered products into the number of animals killed. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Baker et al. provide a powerful new tool for such assessments: molecular identification of commercially available products from a depleted population of minke whales in South Korea is combined with genotyping and novel capture-recapture methods to estimate not only the number of individuals taken, but also the persistence of the resulting products in the marketplace. © 2007 The Authors.",,"animal; biodiversity; developing country; economics; environmental protection; human; Korea; meat; minke whale; Peru; poverty; short survey; statistics; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Humans; Korea; Meat; Minke Whale; Peru; Poverty; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Cheloniidae; Sirenia; Testudines",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Cooke, J.C., Lavery, S., Al, E., Estimating the number of whales entering trade using DNA profiling and capture-recapture analysis of market products (2007) Molecular Ecology, , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03317.x; Baker, C.S., Cipriano, F., Palumbi, S.R., Molecular identification of whale and dolphin products from commercial markets in Korea and Japan (1996) Molecular Ecology, 5, pp. 671-685; Brashares, J.S., Arcese, P., Sam, M.K., Al, E., Bushmeat hunting, wildlife declines, and fish supply in West Africa (2004) Science, 306, pp. 1180-1183; Cipriano, F., Palumbi, S.R., Genetic tracking of a protected whale (1999) Nature, 397, pp. 307-308; Clapham, P., Childerhouse, S., Gales, N., Al, E., The whaling issue: Conservation, confusion and casuistry (2007) Marine Policy, 31, pp. 314-319; Fa, J.E., Johnson, P.J., Dupain, J., Al, E., Sampling effort and dynamics of bushmeat markets (2004) Animal Conservation, 7, pp. 409-416; Fretey, J., (2001) Biogeography and Conservation of Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.

We reconstructed cetacean phytogeny using a 1.7-kbp fragment of the non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY), including the SRY gene and a flanking non-coding region. The topology of the Y-chromosome tree is robust to various methods of analysis and exhibits high branch-support values, possibly due to the absence of recombination, small effective population size, and low homoplasy. The Y-chromosome tree indicates monophyly of each suborder, Mysticeti and Odontoceti, with high branch support values (BS≥86%; PP≥98%). In the Odontoceti clade, three super-families, Physeteroidea, Ziphioidea, and Delphinoidea, diverged soon after the split between Mysticeti and Odontoceti. Our analysis allows resolution of this rapid radiation and indicates that Physeteroidea is basal in the Odontoceti clade (BS, 99%; PP, 100%; MBS, 61%). The major split within the superfamily Delphinoidea is between the Delphinidae clade and the Monodontidae+ Phocoenidae clade. The phylogenetic relationships among delphinid species are ambiguous, probably because of the rapid radiation of this family. In the Mysticeti clade, the first major split is between Balaenidae and Balaenopteridae; within Balaenopteridae, a Balaenopfera acutorostrata+B. bonaerensis (minke whales) clade forms a sister clade with the other balaenopterid species. Megaptera novaeangliae is nested within Balaenoptera, making the latter paraphyletic. The low homoplasy exhibited by the Y-chromosome data presented here suggests that an extended data set incorporating longer sequences would provide better resolution of cetacean lower-level pylogeny. © 2007 Zoological Society of Japan.","Cetacea; Molecular phylogeny; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Paternal inheritance; Y chromosome","primer DNA; animal; animal disease; article; Cetacea; chemistry; classification; female; genetics; male; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; SRY gene; Y chromosome; Animals; Base Sequence; Cetacea; DNA Primers; Female; Genes, sry; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Y Chromosome; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Monodontidae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Phocoenidae; Skenea","GENBANK: AB108509, AB108510, AB108511, AB108512, AB108513","DNA Primers",,,,,"Adachi, J., Hasegawa, M., Phylogeny of whales: Dependence of the inference on species sampling (1995) Mol Biol Evol, 12, pp. 177-179; Adegoke, J.A., Arnason, U., Widegren, B., Sequence organization and evolution, in all extant whalebone whales, of a DNA satellite with terminal chromosome localization (1993) Chromosoma, 102, pp. 382-388; Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans Automat Contr, 19, pp. 716-723; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Comparison between the complete mtDNA sequences of Blue whale and the Fin whale, two species that can hybridize in nature (1993) J Mol Evol, 37, pp. 312-322; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Relationship of baleen whales estab-lished by cytochrome b gene sequence comparison (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 726-728; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Cytochrome b nucleotide sequences and idntification of five primary lineages of extant cetaceans (1996) Mol Biol Evol, 13, pp. 407-417; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two Sperm whale species (1993) Mol Biol Evol, 10, pp. 960-970; Árnason, U., Gullberg, A., Janke, A., Mitogenomic analyses provide new insights into cetacean origin and evolution (2004) Gene, 26, pp. 27-34; Avise, J.C., Wollenberg, K., Phylogenetics and the origin of species (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 94, pp. 7748-7755; Bachtrog, D., Evidence that positive selection drives Y-chromosome degeneration in Drosophila miranda (2004) Nat Genet, 36, pp. 518-522; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S.R., Population structure, molecular systematics, and forensic identification of whales and dolphins (1996) Conservation Genetics.

These results indicate that whale spermatogenic cells acquire SOAF activity, which is closely related to their Ca2+ oscillationinducing ability at the relatively early stage of spermiogenesis. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.","Ca2+ oscillations; Minke whale; Mouse assay; SOAF; Spermiogenesis","animal; Antarctica; article; calcium signaling; cytology; female; fertility; haploidy; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; male; meiosis; mouse; oocyte; physiology; spermatid; spermatozoon; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Calcium Signaling; Female; Haploidy; Male; Meiosis; Mice; Oocytes; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Spermatids; Spermatozoa; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Amemiya, K., Iwanami, Y., Kobayashi, T., Terao, T., Fukui, Y., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Hochi, S., Acquirement of oocyte-activating factor in Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) spermatogenic cells, assessed by meiosis resumption of microinseminated mouse oocytes (2004) J.

Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies. Identification of surface fronts from satellite imagery thus effectively complemented field observations of whales. These findings significantly increase our understanding of habitat quality in rorqual whales, and encourage a greater use of dynamic environmental variables in future studies of whale habitat use. © Inter-Research 2007.","Blue whale; Finback whale; Gulf of St. Lawrence; Habitat selection; Humpback whale; Minke whale; Sea surface temperature; Thermal fronts","environmental factor; feeding behavior; feeding mechanism; habitat selection; oceanic front; population distribution; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; temperature effect; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Baumgartner, M.F., Mate, B.R., Summer and fall habitat of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) inferred from satellite telemetry (2005) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 62, pp. 527-543; Baumgartner, M.F., Cole, T.V.N., Clapham, P.J., Mate, B.R., North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999-2001 (2003) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 264, pp. 137-154; Benson, S.R., Croll, D.A., Marinovic, B.B., Chavez, F.P., Harvey, J.T., Changes in the cetacean assemblage of a coastal upwelling ecosystem during El Nino 1997-98 and La Nina 1999 (2002) Prog Oceanogr, 54, pp. 279-291; Bjørge, A., How persistent are marine mammal habitats in an ocean of variability?

We test the hypothesis that elevated ocean-surface temperatures can facilitate allopatry among pelagic populations and thus promote speciation. Oceanographic modelling has shown that increasing surface temperatures cause localization and reduction of upwelling, leading to fragmentation of feeding areas critical to pelagic species. We test our hypothesis by genetic analyses of populations of two closely related baleen whales, the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whose current distributions and migration patterns extent are largely determined by areas of consistent upwelling with high primary production. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA control-region nucleotide sequences collected from 467 whales sampled in four different ocean basins were employed to infer the evolutionary relationship among populations of B. acutorostrata by rooting an intraspecific phylogeny with a population of B. bonaerensis. Our findings suggest that the two species diverged in the Southern Hemisphere less than 5 million years ago (Ma). This estimate places the speciation event during a period of extended global warming in the Pliocene. We propose that elevated ocean temperatures in the period facilitated allopatric speciation by disrupting the continuous belt of upwelling maintained by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our analyses revealed that the current populations of B. acutorostrata likely diverged after the Pliocene some 1.5 Ma when global temperatures had decreased and presumably coinciding with the re-establishment of the polar-equatorial temperature gradient that ultimately drives upwelling. In most population samples, we detected genetic signatures of exponential population expansions, consistent with the notion of increasing carrying capacity after the Pliocene. Our hypothesis that prolonged periods of global warming facilitate speciation in pelagic marine species that depend on upwelling should be tested by comparative analyses in other pelagic species. © 2007 The Authors.","Cetacea; Evolution; Expansion; Global warming; Phylogeography; Speciation","mitochondrial DNA; primer DNA; animal; article; comparative study; DNA sequence; genetics; geography; greenhouse effect; minke whale; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population dynamics; population genetics; sea; species difference; species differentiation; temperature; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Speciation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Minke Whale; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Temperature; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Mysticeti","GENBANK: EF113709, EF113710, EF113711, EF113712, EF113713, EF113714, EF113715, EF113716, EF113717, EF113718, EF113719, EF113720, EF113721, EF113722, EF113723, EF113724, EF113725, EF113726, EF113727, EF113728, EF113729, EF113730, EF113731, EF113732, EF113733, EF113734, EF113735, EF113736, EF113737, EF113738, EF113739, EF113740, EF113741, EF113742, EF113743, EF113744, EF113745, EF113746, EF113747, EF113748, EF113749, EF113750, EF113751, EF113752, EF113753, EF113754, EF113755, EF113756, EF113757, EF113758, EF113759, EF113760, EF113761, EF113762, EF113763, EF113764, EF113765, EF113766, EF113767, EF113768, EF113769, EF113770, EF113771, EF113772, EF113773, EF113774, EF113775, EF113776, EF113777, EF113778, EF113779, EF113780, EF113781, EF113782, EF113783, EF113784, EF113785, EF113786, EF113787, EF113788, EF113789, EF113790, EF113791, EF113792, EF113793, EF113794, EF113795, EF113796, EF113797, EF113798, EF113799, EF113800, EF113801, EF113802, EF113803, EF113804, EF113805, EF113806, EF113807, EF113808, EF113809, EF113810, EF113811, EF113812, EF113813, EF113814, EF113815, EF113816, EF113817, EF113818, EF113819, EF113820, EF113821, EF113822, EF113823, EF113824, EF113825, EF113826, EF113827, EF113828, EF113829, EF113830, EF113831, EF113832, EF113833, EF113834, EF113835, EF113836, EF113837, EF113838, EF113839, EF113840, EF113841, EF113842, EF113843, EF113844, EF113845, EF113846, EF113847, EF113848, EF113849, EF113850, EF113851, EF113852, EF113853, EF113854, EF113855, EF113856, EF113857, EF113858, EF113859, EF113860, EF113861, EF113862, EF113863, EF113864, EF113865, EF113866, EF113867, EF113868, EF113869, EF113870, EF113871, EF113872, EF113873, EF113874, EF113875, EF113876, EF113877, EF113878, EF113879, EF113880, EF113881, EF113882, EF113883, EF113884, EF113885, EF113886, EF113887, EF113888, EF113889, EF113890, EF113891, EF113892, EF113893, EF113894, EF113895","DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,,"Adachi J, Hasegawa M (1996) MOLPHY: programs for molecular phylogenetics version 2.3.

Logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach related the occurrence of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis (the most abundant species) to whether we were in open- or pack-ice-covered pelagic or neritic waters, in or out of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and north or south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern boundary. Other variables included date and distance to the MIZ and shelfbreak front. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sighting a minke, as well as killer whale - but not the case for an index to whale density - was related to the proximity of coastal polynyas in early autumn, switching offshore to the MIZ once waters within the pack began to freeze persistently later in the season. Probability of detection was higher with distance into the MIZ. Supporting these findings, the density index was strongly related to ice concentration in an inverse relationship. The strong relationship to polynyas and the MIZ indicate that sea-ice divergence altered by decadal or longer-term climate change, as described in the recent literature, could well affect any apparent, long-term trends evident in this species' abundance if surveyed only in open or near-to-ice waters. We speculate on how the minke whale's pagophilic nature (1) could have been encouraged by large-scale industrial whaling and by competition with species more characteristic of open waters and the outer MIZ, and (2) may have protected the population somewhat during industrial whaling resulting in the much greater abundance of this species now compared to other targeted species. © 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Amundsen Sea; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Bellingshausen Sea; Cetacean abundance; Cetacean ecology; Killer whale; Marginal ice zone; Minke whale; Orcinus orca; Polynya; Sea ice; Southern Ocean","abundance; biological survey; cetacean; marginal ice zone; pelagic environment; sea ice; species conservation; species occurrence; statistical analysis; subtidal environment; whaling; Amundsen Sea; Bellingshausen Sea; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Orcinus orca",,,,,,,"AGUAYO-LOBO, A., (1994) Is there a population of minke whale that overwinter among the Antarctic sea-ice, 44, pp. 91-98. , INACH; AINLEY, D.G., The biomass of birds and mammals in the Ross Sea, Antarctica (1985) Antarctic nutrient cycles and food webs, pp. 498-515. , W.

Box 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway","A combination of heavy metals, organochlorines (OC) and fatty acids (FA) that reflect long-term deposition (1+ year) in tissues was used in a Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) exploring population substructure in 104 minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata that were sampled in West Greenland, the Central and Northeast Atlantic Sea and in the North Sea in 1998. Using a CDA that included mercury and cadmium in muscle, liver and kidney, and eight OCs and four unsaturated FAs in blubber we were able to separate the whales into four subpopulations: 1) a West Greenland group, 2) a Central Atlantic group represented by whales from Jan Mayen, 3) a Northeast Atlantic group (Svalbard, Barents Sea and northwestern Norway), and 4) a North Sea group. During an assignment test based on the data transformation developed by the CDA, about 84% of the individuals were correctly assigned to the area where they had been caught. The highest degree of misassignment was between Jan Mayen and the Northeast Atlantic groups. The differences among the four groups likely reflected regional differences (i.e. sea water chemistry, prey type and prey availability) among the marine ecosystems within the range studied. The study indicated that a multi-elemental approach based on long-term deposited compounds with different ecological and physiological pathways can be used for identification of subpopulations of marine mammals. © Wildlife Biology.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Minke whale; Multi-elemental analysis; North Atlantic; Subpopulation","Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Borrell, A., Age- and sex-related changes in organochlorine compound levels in fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from the Eastern North Atlantic (1988) Marine Environmental Research, 25, pp. 195-211; (1998) AMAP Assessment Report: Arctic Pollution Issues, , AMAP, Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme AMAP, Oslo, Norway, 859 pp; Andersen, G., Kovacs, K.M., Lydersen, C., Skaare, J.U., Gjertz, I., Jensen, B.M., Concentrations and patterns of organochlorine contaminants in white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from Svalbard, Norway (2001) Science of the Total Environment, 264, pp. 267-281; Andersen, L.W., Born, E.W., Dietz, R., Haug, T., Øien, N., Bendixen, B., Genetic population structure of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) from Greenland, the Northeast Atlantic and the North Sea probably reflects different ecological regions (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 247, pp. 263-280; Anonymous 1993: Annex F.

Whale sighting and sampling surveys and prey surveys using quantitative echosounder and mid-water trawl were carried out concurrently in the study. Biomasses of Japanese anchovy, walleye pollock and krill, which were major prey species of common minke and Bryde's whales, were estimated using an echosounder. The results suggested that common minke whale showed prey selection for Japanese anchovy while they seemed to avoid krill in both the offshore and coastal regions and walleye pollock in the continental shelf region. Selection for shoaling pelagic fish was similar to that in the eastern North Atlantic. Bryde's whale showed selection for Japanese anchovy in August 2000 and July 2001, while it showed prey selection for krill in May and June in 2001. © 2007 The Authors.","Bryde's whale; Common minke whale; Japanese anchovy; Krill; Prey selection; Walleye pollock","echo sounder; estimation method; prey selection; sampling; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera edeni; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Engraulidae; Engraulis japonicus; Euphausiacea; Theragra chalcogramma",,,,,,,"Abe, K., Iida, K., Mukai, T., Diurnal changes of area backscattering coefficient during the acoustic survey of walleye pollock (1999) Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 65, pp. 252-259. , in Japanese with English abstract; Aglen, A.

Although previous research has been conducted on the foraging strategies of this small rorqual whale, in terms of prey aggregation and assimilation, relatively little has been published on the foraging association of this species with coastal seabirds. Over the past five years, minke whales occurring along the outer coastline of the southern Moray Firth in north-east Scotland during the summer and autumn months have been recorded foraging in the presence of seabirds, such as kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), herring gulls (Larus argentatus), guillemots (Uria aalge) and shearwaters, which form dense feeding rafts at the water's surface. The formation of bird rafts notably occurs independently of the presence of B. acutorostrata, believed instead to be the successive result of prey concentrated at the surface by predatory schooling fish from below rather than by activities of the whales themselves. In this area of the North Sea, schooling mackerel (Scomber scombrus) constitute the most significant component of the summer fish biomass and are believed to perform the role of compacting targeted sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) prey into concentrated bait balls almost exclusively. The resulting ball of prey is consequently available to the foraging whale, which can be seen opportunistically utilizing successive bird rafts rather than expending unnecessary energy corralling the Ammodytes prey by traditional, active entrapment methods. The role of the mackerel in increasing both the rate and density of sandeel ball formation (as indicated by the presence and activity of associated bird rafts) is therefore thought to be very significant in this inshore Scottish location. Changes in oceanographic variables such as water temperature have been directly correlated with the migration of S. scombrus. The observed inter-annual variability in B. acutorostrata distribution in the outer Moray Firth may subsequently be related to the respective distribution and abundance of these migratory, pelagic fish species. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"abundance; behavioral response; foraging behavior; migration; pelagic fish; perciform; population distribution; prey availability; schooling behavior; seabird; water temperature; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Eurasia; Europe; Moray Firth; North Sea; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Alcidae; Ammodytes; Aves; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Larus; Larus argentatus; Procellariidae; Rissa tridactyla; Scomber scombrus; Uria aalge",,,,,,,"Gill, A., Fairbairns, B.R., Fairbairns, R.S., Some observations of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) feeding behaviour and associations with seabirds in the coastal waters of the Isle of Mull, Scotland (2000) European Research on Cetaceans, 13, pp. 61-64; Hoelzel, A.R., Dorsey, E.M., Stern, S.J., The foraging specialisations of individual minke whales (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 786-794; Report of the Working Group on the Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine, and Anchovy (WGMHSA) (2005) International Council for the Exploration of the Sea CM (Papers and Reports, , ICES, CM 2005/ACFM:08, 472 pp; Reid, D.G., Turrell, W.R., Walsh, M., Corten, A., Crossshelf processes north of Scotland in relation to the southerly migration of western mackerel (1997) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 54, pp. 168-178; Robinson, K.P. & Tetley, M.J., 2005.

The objective was to collect sightings data for all cetacean species encountered to begin to collate information for a large-scale sightings database. Two observers employed standard-distance sampling techniques and visual observations (naked eye) to scan for cetaceans during daylight hours and favourable weather conditions. Approximately 112 h were spent surveying over 23 d. A total of 13 cetacean species were encountered, with 173 separate sightings recorded, totalling over 2000 animals. The most commonly sighted species were minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata: N=44), Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus: N=34, with group sizes of up to 600), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae: N=31). The distribution of minke whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins and fin whales was linked to underlying oceanographic variables. Overall patterns of distribution were consistent with our understanding of the summer distributions for the species encountered. The survey highlighted the cetacean diversity of the northern North Atlantic region. Repeat work using this methodology will allow an examination of species' distributions and estimation of their relative abundance. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"abundance; cetacean; data acquisition; monitoring; passenger ship; population distribution; species diversity; surveying; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae",,,,,,,"Dietz, R., Teilmann, J., Heide-Jorgensen, M., Jensen, M.K., Satellite tracking of humpback whales in West Greenland (2002) NERI Technical Report, , No. 411, National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark; Evans, P.G.H., Hammond, P.S., Monitoring cetaceans in European waters (2004) Mammal Review, 34, pp. 131-156; Kapel, F.O. & F.

A single observer recorded the positions, species, numbers and surface activity of whales encountered during boat tours. We controlled for biased search effort by calculating sightings rates for both species in cells measuring 2′ latitude by 2′ longitude throughout the study area. Sightings rates were calculated by dividing the number of sightings of fin and minke whales in each cell by the number of visits by the tour boat to that cell. We used generalized additive models and generalized linear models to examine the influence of benthic topography on whale distribution patterns. Models showed a non-linear relationship for minke whale sighting rates with increasing benthic slopes and a linear relationship for minke and fin whale sightings rates with increasing water depth. Sightings of minkes were concentrated in areas subject to tidal wakes near the northern tips of Grand Manan and Campobello Island. Fin whales were also found off the northern tip of Grand Manan but sighting rates for this species were highest in areas with less benthic sloping topography adjacent to the relatively deep Owen Basin. Foraging was recorded during 87% of all whale encounters and our results indicate that whale distribution in this area is likely to be influenced by depth, bottom topography and fine scale oceanographic features that facilitate foraging. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"benthos; foraging behavior; habitat fragmentation; habitat structure; population distribution; topography; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Australasia; Australia; Bay of Fundy; Bowen Basin; Campobello Island; Canada; Grand Manan Archipelago; New Brunswick; North America; Queensland; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , ed.

Spatial and temporal trends in the distribution of the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata were assessed at a coastal North Sea study area in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Between March 1999 and October 2001, cetacean data were collected using both land- and vessel-based survey methods. A total of 174 sightings of these three cetacean species was recorded during approximately 330 h of combined survey effort (228 h land-based and 102 h vessel-based). Harbour porpoises were present throughout the year with peak occurrence during August and September. The presence of white-beaked dolphins and minke whales was strictly seasonal, with a peak in occurrence during August. The fine-scale distribution of all three species varied within the study area, with an apparent preference for sections of coast adjacent to deeper water. Most porpoise calves and juveniles were recorded between June and September, when 35% of harbour porpoise groups contained immature animals. The proportion of calves amongst porpoise sightings was higher during June than any other month. White-beaked dolphin calves were present in 32% of groups, and occurred in all three months that the species was recorded. Group size was higher in white-beaked dolphin pods containing immature animals. The strong seasonality in occurrence of all three species may relate to requirements for breeding habitat, movements of shared prey species and/or inter-specific competition with other species. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"breeding site; dolphin; group size; interspecific competition; population distribution; prey availability; spatial variation; species occurrence; temporal variation; whale; Aberdeenshire; Atlantic Ocean; Eurasia; Europe; North Sea; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Aarefjord, H. & Bjørge, A.J., 1995.

Data were collected in early summer (June/July) in 2004 and 2005 and the distribution of marine mammal species was compared to 10 ecogeographic variables (EGVs). Of 13 species of marine mammals sighted during the study, there were sufficient sightings to examine the habitat preferences of seven. For all species a measure of 'shelf tendency' (distance to coast or water depth) was an important variable and the species could be separated into two groups, the deep-water species and the shelf species, with little overlap between them. The occurrence of both deep-water species (long-finned pilot whales and Atlantic white-sided dolphins) was also related to dynamic variables such as sea surface temperature (SST) or primary productivity. Two of the shelf species (northern minke whales and grey seals) were only linked to topographic variables and were limited to quite specific habitats. A third species (harbour porpoise) was primarily related to topographic variables, but in the shallowest waters was also related to local variation in SST. The occurrence of the final two species (common and white-beaked dolphins) was linked to SST and local primary productivity. However, while both species preferentially occurred in areas with higher productivity, the two species differed in their preference for SST, with common dolphins preferentially occurring in warmer waters and white-beaked dolphins in colder waters. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",,"deep water; habitat selection; marine mammal; population distribution; primary production; sea surface temperature; species occurrence; topographic effect; Eurasia; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Halichoerus grypus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Mammalia; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Barlow, J., Gisiner, R., Mitigating, monitoring and assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on beaked whales (2006) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 7, pp. 239-249; Chase, J.M., Leibold, M.A., (2003) Ecological niches: Linking classical and contemporary approaches, , Chicago, USA: University of Chicago Press; De'ath, G., Fabricius, K.E., Classification and regression trees: A powerful yet simple technique for ecological data analysis (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 3178-3192; Evans, P.G.H., (1992) Status review of cetaceans in British and Irish waters, , Oxford, UK: Sea Watch Foundation; Harwood, J., Marine mammals and their environment in the twenty-first century (2001) Journal of Mammalogy, 82, pp. 630-640; Learmonth, J.A., MacLeod, C.D., Santos, M.B., Pierce, G.J., Crick, H.Q.P., Robinson, R.A., Potential effects of climate change in marine mammals (2006) Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review, 44, pp. 431-464; MacLeod, K., Abundance of Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) during summer off northwest Scotland (2004) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, 6, pp. 33-40; MacLeod, C.D., Hauser, N., Peckham, H., Diversity, abundance and structure of the cetacean community in summer months east of Great Abaco, The Bahamas (2004) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 84, pp. 469-474; MacLeod, C.D., Bannon, S.M., Pierce, G.J., Schweder, C., Learmonth, J.A., Herman, J.S., Reid, R.J., Climate change and the cetacean community of north-west Scotland (2005) Biological Conservation, 124, pp. 477-483; MacLeod, K., Simmonds, M.P., Murray, E., Summer distribution and relative abundance of cetacean populations off north-west Scotland (2003) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 83, pp. 1187-1192; Meyer, E.M., Townsend Peterson, A., Hargrove, W.W., Ecological niches as stable distributional constraints on mammal species, implications for Pleistocene extinctions and climate change projections for biodiversity (2004) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 13, pp. 305-314; Pollock, C.M., (2000) The distribution of seabirds and marine mammals in the Atlantic Frontier, north and west of Scotland, , Aberdeen: Joint Nature Conservation Committee; Redfern, J.V., Techniques for cetacean-habitat modelling (2006) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 310, pp. 271-295; (2006) R: A language and environment for statistical computing, , http://www.R-project.org, R Development Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.

The deduced amino acid sequences of minke whale CYP2C78, 2E1, 3A72, 4A35 and 4V6 showed high identities with cattle CYP2C86 (83%), pig CYP2E1 (85%), sheep CYP3A24 (82%), pig CYP4A21 (80%), and human CYP4V2 (76%), respectively. To investigate whether or not these CYP expression levels are altered by contamination of organochlorine contaminants (OCs), mRNA levels of these CYPs in the liver of common minke whale were measured using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method, and the quantified mRNA levels were employed for the statistical analysis with the residue levels of OCs including PCBs, DDTs (p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE), chlordanes (cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane), HCHs (α-, β- and γ-isomers) and hexachlorobenzene that have already been reported elsewhere. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed no significant correlation between CYP expression levels and each OC level in the common minke whale liver, implying that these environmental chemicals have no potential to alter the expression levels of these CYPs or the residue levels encountered in the whale livers may not reach their transcriptional regulation levels. This suggests that the expression of individual CYPs in the whale liver may be at basal level. Relationships among hepatic mRNA expression levels of these CYP2-4 isozymes together with CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were also examined. Significant positive correlations were detected among mRNA expression levels of individual CYP isozymes in most cases. These associations indicate that the transcriptional regulation of these CYPs examined in this study may be reciprocally related. CYP1A1 levels showed a positive correlation with CYP1A2 levels (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) indicating that both CYP isozymes were regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor activated by endogenous ligands. A strong positive correlation between CYP2C78 and 3A72 (r = 0.90, p < 0.001) suggests that expression of these CYP isozymes may be under a regulation mechanism of cross-talk in which specific nuclear receptors such as constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor are involved. The present study indicates that minke whale from the North Pacific may be a model species to investigate the mechanism of basal regulation of these CYPs. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It shows several adaptations to the aquatic environment, especially in the cortical arrangements of functional areas. To study structural aspects of the mysticete brain we estimated neocortical features in the common minke whale using stereological methods. The neocortex was surprisingly thick, equal to that in humans. The total neocortical neuron number was 12.8 × 109, and the total neocortical glia number 98.2 × 10 9. Total cell numbers in the auditory and visual cortex were also estimated, and showed that the auditory cortex contained more cells than the visual cortex. In this small sample, no sexual dimorphism was seen within the neocortex of the common minke whale. Our aim was to estimate the total cell number, cortical volume and cell density in the entire mysticete neocortex and compare the total cell number in the auditory cortex with that of the visual cortex using stereological methods. Here, we used the common minke whale as a model of all mysticetes.

Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (B. acutorostrata) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and 6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The evidence to support this is reviewed here and is best developed for some odontocete species, although recent studies on minke whales show that the behaviour of baleen whales may be more complex than previously thought. As one consequence of high intelligence, the potential impacts of whaling and other removals may be far greater than they appear and a new approach to the conservation of these species - which takes into account their intelligence, societies, culture and potential to suffer - is advocated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Emphasis is given to the energy flow through the ecosystem from an end-to-end perspective, i.e. from bacteria, through phytoplankton and zooplankton to fish, mammals and birds. Primary production in the Barents is on average 93 g C m-2 y-1, but interannually highly variable (±19%), responding to climate variability and change (e.g. variations in Atlantic Water inflow, the position of the ice edge and low-pressure pathways). The traditional focus upon large phytoplankton cells in polar regions seems less adequate in the Barents, as the cell carbon in the pelagic is most often dominated by small cells that are entangled in an efficient microbial loop that appears to be well coupled to the grazing food web. Primary production in the ice-covered waters of the Barents is clearly dominated by planktonic algae and the supply of ice biota by local production or advection is small. The pelagic-benthic coupling is strong, in particular in the marginal ice zone. In total 80% of the harvestable production is channelled through the deep-water communities and benthos. 19% of the harvestable production is grazed by the dominating copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis in Atlantic or Arctic Water, respectively. These two species, in addition to capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus), are the keystone organisms in the Barents that create the basis for the rich assemblage of higher trophic level organisms, facilitating one of the worlds largest fisheries (capelin, cod, shrimps, seals and whales). Less than 1% of the harvestable production is channelled through the most dominating higher trophic levels such as cod, harp seals, minke whales and sea birds. Atlantic cod, seals, whales, birds and man compete for harvestable energy with similar shares. Climate variability and change, differences in recruitment, variable resource availability, harvesting restrictions and management schemes will influence the resource exploitation between these competitors, that basically depend upon the efficient energy transfer from primary production to highly successful, lipid-rich zooplankton and pelagic fishes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

E. Jacqmain, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium","The exploitation and sale of wildlife species that are endangered in only part of their range present regulators with the critical challenge of separating legal from illegal takes. Wildlife DNA registers created from tissue samples of legally obtained individual wildlife specimens can address this problem by allowing managers to identify unregistered (presumably illegally obtained) specimens. We tested the effectiveness of the only current, fully operational wildlife DNA register of individual genetic profiles collected from legally caught minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Twenty minke whale tissue samples collected at markets in Norway and 2 additional samples collected from beached minke whales in Denmark, were genotyped at 12 loci used by the Norwegian minke whale DNA register. Genetic profiles of these samples then were compared against the 2676 individual profiles deposited in the Norwegian register. The high number of genetic markers used to identify individuals in our study allowed consistent matching of sample and reference profiles despite an overall error rate (due to experimental and interlaboratory data standardization) estimated at 0.015 per locus. Of the 22 test samples only the 2 Danish samples failed to match an existing profile in the Norwegian minke whale DNA register. Our results show that the basic principle of wildlife DNA registers can work in a real-life situation. The strength of wildlife DNA registers lies in their ability to unambiguously identify unregistered specimens with the aid of sensitive genetic methods that enable analysis of highly processed or degraded tissue samples. Our study also highlights a number of methodological problems such as laboratory errors and interlaboratory data standardization, which need be addressed to ensure a successful implementation of wildlife DNA registers. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Genetic tagging; Minke whale; Poaching; Probability of identity","DNA; DNA; endangered species; exploitation; species conservation; whale; wildlife management; animal; animal identification; article; classification; commercial phenomena; Denmark; environmental protection; genetics; legal aspect; methodology; minke whale; register; standard; Animal Identification Systems; Animals; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Denmark; DNA; Minke Whale; Registries; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"Annex O: Report of the working group on DNA identification and tracking of whale products (2001) Journal of Cetacean Management and Research, 3 (SUPPL.), pp. 316-323; Baker, C.S., Palumbi, S., Which whales are hunted? a molecular genetic approach to monitoring whaling (1994) Science, 265, pp. 1538-1539; Baker, C.S., Dalebout, M.L., Lavery, S., Ross, H.A., www.DNA-surveillance: Applied molecular taxonomy for species conservation and discovery (2003) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, pp. 271-272; Beissinger, S.R., Trade of live wild birds: Potentials, principles, and practices of sustainable use (2001) Conservation of Exploited Species, pp. 182-202. , J.

Physical forcing greatly affects productivity, recruitment, survival and distribution of krill in this area. In turn, such interactions are likely to affect the distribution of baleen whales. The Southern Ocean GLOBEC research program aims to explore the relationships and interactions between the environment, krill and predators around Marguerite Bay (WAP) in autumn 2001 and 2002. Bathymetric and environmental variables including acoustic backscattering as an indicator of prey abundance were used to model whale distribution patterns. We used an iterative approach employing (1) classification and regression tree (CART) models to identify oceanographic and ecological variables contributing to variability in humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke Balaenoptera acutorstrata whale distribution, and (2) generalized additive models (GAMs) to elucidate functional ecological relationships between these variables and whale distribution. The CART models indicated that the cetacean distribution was tightly coupled with zooplankton acoustic volume backscatter in the upper (25 to 100 m), and middle (100 to 300 m) portions of the water column. Whale distribution was also related to distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope. The GAMs indicated a persistent, strong, positive relationship between increasing zooplankton volume and whale relative abundance. Furthermore, there was a lower limit for averaged acoustic volume backscatter of zooplankton below which the relationship between whales and prey was not significant. The GAMs also supported an annual relationship between whale distribution, distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope, suggesting that these are important features for aggregating prey. Our results demonstrate that during the 2 yr study, whales were consistently and predictably associated with the distribution of zooplankton. Thus, humpback and minke whales may be able to locate physical features and oceanographic processes that enhance prey aggregation. © Inter-Research 2006.","Antarctica; CART; GAM; Ice edge; SO GLOBEC;

As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with <1 % of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models. © Inter-Research 2006.","Distribution; GIS; Global; Habitat suitability modeling; Marine mammals; Niche model; Relative environmental suitability","cetacean; environmental modeling; habitat use; mapping; marine ecosystem; pinniped; population distribution; range expansion; taxonomy; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Callorhinus ursinus; Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Angel, M.V., Long-term, large-scale patterns in marine pelagic systems (1992) Proceedings of the 34th Symposium of the British Ecological Society with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, pp. 377-402. , Giller PS, Hildrew AG, Raffaelli DG (eds) Aquatic ecology: scale, pattern and process.

The major component of HDBPs was 3,3′,4,4′-tetra-bromo-5,5′-dichloro-1,1′-dimethyl -2,2′-bipyrrole (Br4Cl2-DBP), accounting for 85% of the total of five HDBPs detected, followed by Br3Cl2-DBP. Mean concentrations of HDBPs ranged from 0.27 μg/g lipid (n = 31) in minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) from the northwest Pacific Ocean to 11.8 μg/g lipid (n = 33) in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops trucatus) from the southwest Japanese coastal water. At higher levels, HDBPs made up 37% of the total organohalogen body burden in Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), whereas the contribution was less than 8.9% in minke whales. In two data subsets from Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), the products from the Pacific Ocean contained significantly higher concentrations of HDBPs than those from the Sea of Japan. Furthermore, the geographical distribution of HDBPs did not resemble those of ubiquitous anthropogenic organochlorines, such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs). Higher concentration ratios of ΣHDBP/ΣPCB and different patterns of HDBP congeners were observed in whale products from the Asia-Pacific as compared to non-Pacific Ocean mammals reported previously. These results support the hypothesis that HDBPs and anthropogenic organochlorines have different sources and that the consumption of HDBPs by Japanese individuals could be an exposure/health risk. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"3,3',4,4' tetrabromo 5,5' dichloro 1,1' dimethyl 2,2' bipyrrole; 3,3',4,4',5,5' hexabromo 1,1' dimethyl 2,2' bipyrrole; halogen; methyl group; organochlorine derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; pyrrole derivative; unclassified drug; anthropogenic effect; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); dolphin; health care; organochlorine; whale; article; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); dolphin; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; health hazard; Japan; lipid analysis; mammal; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; porpoise; priority journal; quantitative analysis; whale; Animals; Cetacea; Environmental Monitoring; Food Contamination; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Brominated; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Japan; Oceans and Seas; Pyrroles; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Berardius bairdii; Cetacea; dolphin (cetacean); Mammalia; Phocoenidae; Phocoenoides dalli; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,"Hydrocarbons, Brominated; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pyrroles; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,"Andersen, R.J., Wolfe, M.S., Faulkner, D.J., Autotoxic antibiotic production by a marine chromobacterium (1974) Mar Biol, 27, pp. 281-285; Aono, S., Tanabe, S., Fujise, Y., Kato, H., Tatsukawa, R., Persistent organochlorines in minke whale (Baleanoptera acutorostrata) and their prey species from the Antarctic and North Pacific (1997) Environ Pollut, 98, pp. 81-89; Dalebout, M.L., Lento, G.M., Cipriano, F., Funahashi, N., Baker, C.S., How many protected minke whales are sold in Japan and Korea?

The MMPP can accommodate the spatial cluster structure typical of many line transect surveys. The basic idea is that animal density switches between a low and a high level according to a latent Markov process. The MMPP is attractive from a mathematical point of view, as it provides an explicit expression for the likelihood function and other important quantities. We focus on estimating the level of overdispersion in the number of detected animals, as this is important for quantifying the precision of the line transect estimator of animal abundance.

In this study, a DRD4 gene exon III tandem repeat from the order Cetacea was identified and characterized. Included in our study were samples from 10 white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), 10 harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), eight sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and five minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Using enzymatic amplification followed by sequencing of amplified fragments, a tandem repeat composed of 18-bp basic units was detected in all of these species. The tandem repeats in white-beaked dolphin and harbor porpoise were both monomorphic and consisted of 11 and 12 basic units, respectively. In contrast, the sperm whale harbored a polymorphic tandem repeat with size variants composed of three, four, and five basic units. Also the tandem repeat in minke whale was polymorphic; size variants composed of 6 or 11 basic units were found in this species. The consensus sequences of the basic units were identical in the closely related white-beaked dolphin and harbor porpoise, and these sequences differed by a maximum of two changes when compared to the remaining species. There was a high degree of similarity between the cetacean basic unit consensus sequences and those from members of the horse family and domestic cow, which also harbor a tandem repeat composed of 18-bp basic units in exon III of their DRD4 gene. Consequently, the 18-bp tandem repeat appears to have originated prior to the differentiation of hoofed mammals into odd-toed and even-toed ungulates. The composition of the tandem repeat in cetaceans differed markedly from that in primates, which is composed of 48-bp repeat basic units. © The American Genetic Association. 2006.

The effects of cytochalasin B (CB) pretreatment and two types of cryoprotectant solutions (ethylene glycol (EG) or ethylene glycol and dimethylsulfoxide (EG + DMSO)) on the in vitro maturation of vitrified immature whale oocytes were compared, and the developmental capacity of vitrified immature whale oocytes following IVM and intracytoplasmic sperm injection examined (ICSI). The maturation rate did not differ significantly with sexual maturity (adult, 60.9%; prepubertal, 53.1%), but the parthenogenetic activation rate of oocytes from adult donors (76.7%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of oocytes from prepubertal donors (46.4%). The maturation rates after vitrification and warming were not significantly different between the EG (22.2%) and EG + DMSO groups (30.2%), or between the CB-treated (30.4%) and non-CB-treated groups (27.3%). These results indicate that parthenogenetic activation of in vitro matured oocytes from adult minke whales was superior to that from prepubertal whales, but that the developmental capacity of the whale oocytes after parthenogenetic activation or ICSI was still low. The present study also showed that CB treatment before vitrification and two kinds of cryoprotectants did not improve the IVM rate following the vitrification of immature whale oocytes. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.","ICSI; IVM; Minke whale oocyte; Parthenogenetic activation; Vitrification","animal; article; cell culture; female; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; minke whale; oocyte; oocyte cleavage; parthenogenesis; physiology; prenatal development; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cleavage Stage, Ovum; Female; Minke Whale; Oocytes; Parthenogenesis; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Asada, M., Tetsuka, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Improvement on. in vitro maturation, fertilization and development of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 521-533; Certin, Y., Bastan, A., Cryopreservation of immature bovine oocytes by vitrification in straws (2006) Anim.

A survey to estimate prey abundance was also conducted. Prey preference, niche overlap and niche width were described using Manly's alpha (α), Pianka's index (Ojk) and Levin's index (B), respectively. The diet of cod consisted mainly of capelin, deep-water shrimp, gadoids and krill. The smallest cod (≤64 cm length) preferred capelin, whereas the largest cod (&gt;64 cm length) preferred gadoid species, including cod. The minke whale diet consisted mainly of capelin (Mallotus villosus), herring (Clupea harengus) and krill, and showed a particular preference for herring and capelin. Krill were consumed in large quantities, but did not seem to be a preferred food item for either cod or minke whales. In contrast to cod, which fed very little on herring, the minke whale fed heavily on herring in some areas. The niche widths for both cod and minke whales were relatively low, and the diet overlap between minke whale and cod was low. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Cod; Minke whale; Niche overlap; Niche width; Prey preference","gadoid fishery; mammal; niche breadth; niche overlap; prey availability; prey preference; prey selection; whale; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Eurasia; Europe; Finnmark; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Clupeidae; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Gadiformes; Gadus morhua; Mallotus villosus",,,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Foraging time optimization and interactions in food webs (1984) American Naturalist, 124, pp. 80-96; Abrams, P.A., Ginzburg, L.R., The nature of predation: Prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?

The two species primarily involved were orcas (killer whales) (Orcinus orca) and male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Both species took substantial number of fish from the line primarily during day light hours. Catch rates of longliners declined to less than 50% when orcas occurred close to longline vessels while the loss to sperm whales was much less obvious. They were seen diving close to the line down to 400 m where they apparently took fish. Their impact on catch rates was much less notable. Sperm whales became frequently entangled in the line and part of the line was lost in a number of cases. Other cetaceans were rarely seen in the vicinity of longline vessels. They became entangled in the line only occasionally and one whale (presumably a minke whale) died. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"catch statistics; cetacean; fishery management; longlining; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Dissostichus eleginoides; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Abe, T., Iwami, T., Notes on fishes from the stomachs of whales in the Antarctic, II: On Dissostichus and Ceratias (1989) Proc NIPR Symp Polar Biol, 2, pp. 78-82; André, M., Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) behavioural response after the play back of artificial sounds (1997) Rep Int Whal Commn, 47, pp. 499-504; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 11-19 October 1994 (1994) Report of the 13th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 125-211. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 7-16 October 1996 (1996) Report of the 15th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 303-447. , Annex 4, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 13-22 October 1997 (1997) Report of the 16th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 245-425. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 11-22 October 1999 (1999) Report of the 18th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 229-445. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 9-19 October 2000 (2000) Report of the 19th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 283-498. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 8-19 October 2001 (2001) Report of the 20th Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 197-558. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 7-17 October 2002 (2002) Report of the 21st Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 311-502. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Report of the working group on fish stock assessment, Hobart, Australia, 13-23 October 2003 (2003) Report of the 22nd Meeting of the Scientific Committee, pp. 289-547. , Annex 5, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; (2004) A Summary of Observations on Board Longline Vessels Operating Within the CCAMLR Convention Area, , WG-FSA-04/6 Rev. 1 (mimeogr); Ashford, J.P., Rubilar, P.S., Martin, A.R., Interactions between cetaceans and longline fishery operations around South Georgia (1996) Mar Mamm Sci, 12 (3), pp. 452-457; Baird, S.J., (2000) Summary of Seabird and Marine Mammal Observations during Observed Toothfish (Dissostichus spp.) Longline Fishing Operations in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1, 1998-2000, , WG-FSA-00/56, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Baird, S.J., (2004) Summary of the Seabird and Marine Mammal Observations during Observed Toothfish (Dissostichus spp.) Longline Fishing Operations in CCAMLR Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, , WG-FSA-04/42, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Budylenko, G.A., Distribution and some aspects if the biology of killer whales in the South Atlantic (1981) Rep Int Whal Commn, 31, pp. 523-525; Capdeville, D., (1996) Impact of Marine Mammals on Longline Fisheries Around Kerguelen Islands (Division 58.5.1) during the 1995/96 Fishing Season, 6p. , WG-FSA-96/12, CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; (2005) Scheme of International Scientific Observation, 223p. , CCAMLR, Hobart, Australia; Christensen, I., Jonsgård, Å., Rørvik, C.J., Catch statistics for minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) caught by Norway in 1980 (1982) Rep Int Whal Commn, 32, pp. 487-489; Crespo, E.A., Pedraza, S.N., Dans, S.L., Alonso, M.K., Reyes, L.M., Garcia, N.A., Coscarella, M., Schiavini, A., Direct and indirect effects of the high seas fisheries on marine mammal populations in the northern and central Patagonian coast (1997) J Northw Atl Fish Sci, 22, pp. 189-208; Crespo, E.A., Alonso, M.K., Dans, S.L., Garcia, N.A., Pedraza, S.N., Coscarello, M., Gonzalez, R., Incidental catches of dolphins in mid-water trawls for Argentinean anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) off the Argentine shelf (2000) J Cetacean Res Manage, 2 (1), pp. 11-16; Dahlheim, M.E., A review of the biology and exploitation of killer whales, Orcinus orca, with comments on recent sightings from Antarctica (1981) Rep Int Whal Commn, 31, pp. 541-547; Dans, S.L., Alonso, M.K., Pedraza, S.N., Crespo, E.A., Incidental catch of dolphins in trawling fisheries off Patagonia, Argentina: Can populations persist?

Sixteen species were represented in this count, including: minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (1 single stranding), sei whale, B. borealis (1 single stranding), blue whale, B. musculus (1 single stranding), humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (2 single strandings), giant sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (18 single strandings, 2 pair strandings), pygmy sperm whale, Kogia breviceps (5 single strandings), dwarf sperm whale, K. sima (2 single strandings, 1 triple stranding), Blainville's beaked whale, Mesoplodon densirostris (2 single strandings), short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus (4 strandings, 56 individuals), melon-headed whale, Peponocephala electra (1 single stranding and 2 mass strandings totalling 231 individuals), common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (1 single stranding), spinner dolphin, Stenella longirostris (1 pair stranding and 2 mass strandings of groups of ∼30 individuals each), Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus (2 single strandings), dugong, Dugong dugon (14 single strandings), and New Zealand fur seal, Arctocephalus forsteri (3 single strandings). A stranded rorqual identified as an Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), with coloration patterns that did not match known descriptions, was also reported. Sei whale was recorded for the first time in the tropical Southwest Pacific region and Antarctic minke whale, melon-headed whale, and Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin were recorded for the first time in New Caledonia. Strandings of sperm whales were most frequent in the spring, but also occurred in autumn months, suggesting a seasonal pattern of occurrence possibly related to seasonal migration. One stranded humpback whale bore the scars of a killer whale's attack and one dugong was injured by a shark. Scars left by propellers were noted on several stranded animals including one Antarctic minke whale, one pygmy sperm whale, one dwarf sperm whale, and four dugongs. Collisions with vessels were suspected to be a frequent cause of death for dugong. To cite this article: P. Borsa, C. R.

Sighting detection functions are estimated from this and other NOAA research surveys from 1986 to 2002 using a new, multiple-covariate approach. Twenty-four species were seen on this survey, including two species (Fraser's dolphin [Lagenodelphis hosei] and sei whale [Balaenoptera borealis]) that had not been previously documented to occur in Hawaiian waters. The most abundant large whales are sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The most abundant delphinids are pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), Fraser's dolphins, spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and Kogia breviceps) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are also estimated to be quite abundant. Some of the migratory baleen whales (fin whales [Balaenoptera physalus], sei whales, minke whales [B. acutorostrata], and humpback whales [Megaptera novaeangliae]) were seen only late in the survey. Abundance is estimated for 19 cetacean species. The overall density of cetaceans is low in the study area, especially for delphinids. The precision of density and abundance estimates is generally low for all species because of the low number of sightings. © 2006 the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Abundance; Cetacean; Density; Dolphin; Hawai'i; Lagenodelphis hosei; Line-transect survey; Multiple covariates; Pacific; Whale","abundance; cetacean; population density; seasonal variation; Hawaiian Islands; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera edeni; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; dolphin (cetacean); Globicephala macrorhynchus; Kogia; Kogia breviceps; Kogia simus; Lagenodelphis hosei; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella attenuata; Stenella coeruleoalba; Steno; Steno bredanensis; Ziphiidae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Herman, L.M., Alternative population estimates of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Hawaiian waters (1987) Canadian Journal Zoology, 65, pp. 2818-2821; Barlow, J., The abundance of cetaceans in California waters.

In the present study we show that a daily intake of 50-200 g of minke whale blubber causes an impairment of the nonspecific and specific cellular immune system in the West Greenland sledge dog (Canis familiaris). Immune reactions were measured by mitogen (PHA, Con A) and antigen (KLH) intradermal testing, and as the study used exposure levels similar to those of Inuits and polar bears (Ursus maritimus), it is reasonable to infer that Inuits and polar bears suffer from similar decreased resistance to diseases. It is speculated that food sources are depleted by thinning sea ice due to climate change and that more research should assess the forecasted rise in additive immunopathy effects in polar bears. Additionally, our study suggests that the fatty acid composition may be of importance when investigating combined immunotoxic effects of contaminated food resources in future Inuit and polar bear studies. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Antigen-antibody reactions; Cytology; Fatty acids; Immunology; Impurities; Mercury (metal); Testing; Antigen; Cellular immunity; Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber; Mitogen; Organohalogen contaminants; Immunization; antigen; chlordane; chlorphenotane; concanavalin A; dieldrin; hexachlorobenzene; keyhole limpet hemocyanin; lindane; mercury; mitogenic agent; omega 3 fatty acid; organohalogen derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; Antigen-antibody reactions; Cytology; Fatty acids; Immunization; Immunology; Impurities; Mercury (metal); Testing; antigen; fatty acid; immune system; immunity; mercury (element); organohalogen; whale; animal experiment; article; bear; cellular immunity; climate change; controlled study; dog; environmental exposure; female; food contamination; immunotoxicity; intracutaneous test; lipid composition; male; nonhuman; pollution; whale; Animals; Arctic Regions; Climate; Dogs; Environmental Pollutants; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Food Contamination; Greenland; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Immunity, Cellular; Mercury; Minke Whale; Ursidae; Arctic; Greenland; West Greenland; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Canis familiaris; Cetacea; Ursus maritimus",,"chlordane, 12789-03-6, 57-74-9; chlorphenotane, 50-29-3; concanavalin A, 11028-71-0; dieldrin, 13366-73-9, 60-57-1; hexachlorobenzene, 118-74-1, 55600-34-5; lindane, 58-89-9; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; Environmental Pollutants; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Mercury, 7439-97-6",,,,,"(1998) Arctic Pollution 1998, , Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme: Oslo, Norway; (2004) Persistent Organic Pollutants in the Arctic.

In this study, the information gathered by Superintendência para o Desenvolvimento da Pesca and Companhia de Pesca Norte do Brasil from 1975 to 1985 about the whale's group size and composition, sexual proportion, sexual maturity of the captured whales was analyzed. The groups found in the waters of Costinha were in general of small size and composed by animals of both sexes, with a greater proportion of sexual mature and female animals. Calves, lactating or pregnant females were rarely found. That population concentrated in higher number in the waters of Costinha between September to October, the most important period for the species conception. A great number of conceptions might occur at this time in the area. The absence of lactating females and calves in the population demonstrate that births do not occur in this area. Strandings and sightings of young minke whales in the South America east coast (between 25°S e 40°S) suggests that births occur at medium latitudes of this region, where the water temperature is inferior to that one in the Northeast Brazilian Coast. In that way, the possibility of the existence of distinct areas to births and breeding activities of minke whales in the South Atlantic Ocean might be considered. The polygamy is a reproductive behavior of minke whale, observed by the composition and sexual proportion of groups composed by sexual mature animals in this breeding ground.","Distribution; Group characteristics; Reproduction; Whaling","Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Andriolo, A., Rocha, J.M., Zerbini, A., Simões-Lopes, P.C., Moreno, I., Lucena, A., Danilewics, D., Bassoi, M., Distribution and relative density of oceanic whales in a former whaling ground off Eastern South America (2001) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 11p. , Cambridge, IWC Doc SC/53/O13; Baldas, M.I., Castello, H.P., Sobre el hallazgo de ejemplares juveniles de ballena minke, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, en el estuario del Rio de la Plata y sur de Brasil (1986) 1a Reunión de Trabajo de Especialistas en Mamíferos Acuáticos de América del Sur, pp. 1-13. , Buenos Aires; Best, P.B., Seasonal abundance, feeding, reproduction, age, and growth in minke whales off Durban (with incidental observations from the Antarctic) (1982) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 759-786. , Cambridge; Best, P.B., External Characteres of Southern Minke whales and the existence of a diminutive form (1985) Scientific Reports of the Whale Research Institute, 36, pp. 1-33. , Tokyo; Best, P.B., Gambell, R., The abundance of Sei whales off South Africa (1968) Norsk Hvalfangsttid, 57 (6), pp. 168-174; Best, P.B., Butterworth, D.S., Report on the southern hemisphere minke whale assessment cruise, 1978/79 (1980) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 30, pp. 257-283. , Cambridge; Braga, N.M.A., Oliveira, G.M., Silva, F.A.E., Rocha, J.M., Investigações biológicas sobre a baleia minke na costa nordeste do Brasil (1983) Boletim Técnico-Científico Do CEPENE, 26p. , Tamandaré; Gambell, R., Best, P.B., Rice, D.W., Reports on the International Indian Ocean whale marking cruise 24 November 1973 - 3 February 1974 (1975) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 25, pp. 240-252. , Cambridge; Harwood, J., (1990) Biology and Exploitation of the Minke Whale, 238p. , Boca Raton, Ed.

A few δ 15N-depleted peaks occurred along the length of baleen plates for 10 males irrespective of stomach content (anchovies and sauries). Similar δ15N-depleted peaks were also found for one female and two immature individuals. It was likely that these δ15N-depleted peaks formed in early summer. The stable nitrogen isotope ratio (δ15N) values in Pacific saury (9.3 ± 1.4‰) did not differ significantly from that in Japanese anchovy (8.8 ± 0.9‰). In contrast, δ15N in krill (7.2 ± 0.5‰ in July and 8.0 ± 0.2‰ in September) were significantly lower than in the Pacific saury. Thus, these peaks may reflect the dietary change from krill to fishes in the feeding migration of the whales. Growth rate of the baleen plate was estimated to be 129 mm/y, and it appeared that a dietary record of about 1.4 years remained in the baleen plate. For two immature whales, the maximum value of δ15N occurred at the tip of baleen. This δ15N enrichment may possibly be useful for discriminating weanlings and older whales.","Baleen; Common minke whales; Feeding ecology; North Pacific; Stable isotopes","Anchoa; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Cololabis saira; Decapoda (Crustacea); Engraulidae; Engraulis japonicus; Euphausia pacifica; Euphausiacea; Pisces; Scomberesocidae",,,,,,,"Kasamatsu, F., Tanaka, S., Annual changes in prey species of minke whales taken off Japan 1948-1987 (1992) Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 58, pp. 637-651; Kasamatsu, F., Hata, T., Notes on minke whales in the Okhotsk Sea-West Pacific area (1985) RepIntWhalCommn, 35, pp. 299-304; Tamura, T., Fujise, Y., Geographical and seasonal changes of prey species of minke whales in the Northwestern Pacific (2002) ICES JMarSci, 59, pp. 516-528; Wada, E., Terazaki, M., Kabaya, Y., Nemoto, T., 15N and 13C abundances in the Antarctic Ocean with emphasis on the biogeochemical structure of the food web (1987) DeepSeaRes, 34, pp. 829-841; Fry, B., Food web structure on Georges Bank from C, N and S isotope compositions (1988) LimnolOceanogr, 33, pp. 1182-1190; Deniro, M.J., Epstein, S., Influence of diet on the distribution of carbon isotopes in animals (1978) GeochimCosmochimActa, 42, pp. 495-506; Rau, G.H., Mearns, A.J., Young, D.R., Olson, R.J., Schaefer, H.A., Kaplan, I.R., Animal 13C/12C correlates with trophic levels in pelagic food webs (1983) Ecology, 64, pp. 1314-1318; Deniro, M.J., Epstein, S., Influence of diet on the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in animals (1981) GeochimCosmochimActa, 45, pp. 341-351; Minagawa, M., Wada, E., Stepwise enrichment of δ15N along food chains: Further evidence and relation between δ15N and animal age (1984) GeochimCosmochimActa, 48, pp. 1135-1140; Takai, N., Mishima, Y., Yorozu, A., Hoshika, A., Carbon sources for demersal fish in the western Seto Inland Sea, Japan, examined by δ13C and δ15N analyses (2002) LimnolOceanogr, 47, pp. 730-741; Schell, D.M., Saupe, S.M., Haubenstock, N., Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) growth and feeding as estimated by δ13C techniques (1989) MarBiol, 103, pp. 433-443; Schell, D.M., Saupe, S.M., Haubenstock, N., Natural isotope abundances in bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) baleen: Markers of aging and habitat usage (1989) EcolStud, 68, pp. 260-269; Best, P.B., Schell, D.M., Stable isotopes in southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) baleen as indicators of seasonal movements, feeding and growth (1996) MarBiol, 124, pp. 483-494; Rau, G.H., Sweeney, R.E., Kaplan, I.R., 2C ratio changes with latitude: Differences between northern and southern oceans (1982) Deep-Sea Res, 29, pp. 1035-1039. , Plankton 13C: 1; Hobson, K.A., Schell, D.M., Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope patterns in baleen from eastern Arctic bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) (1998) CanJFishAquatSci, 55, pp. 2601-2607; Hobson, K.A., Sease, J.L., Stable isotope analyses of tooth annuli reveal temporal dietary records: An example using steller sea lions (1998) MarMamSci, 14, pp. 116-129; Nakatsuka, T., Handa, N., Harada, N., Sugimoto, T., Imaizumi, S., Origin and decomposition of sinking particulate organic matter in the deep water column inferred from the vertical distributions of its δ15N, δ13C and δ14C (1997) Deep-Sea Res, 44, pp. 1957-1979; Takai, N., Onaka, S., Ikeda, Y., Yatsu, A., Kidokoro, H., Sakamoto, W., Geographical variations in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in squid (2000) JMarBiolAssocUK, 80, pp. 675-684; Hatanaka, H., Miyashita, T., On the feeding migration of the Okhotsk Sea-West Pacific stock of minke whales, estimates based on length composition data (1997) RepIntWhalCommn, 47, pp. 557-567; Lockyer, C., Growth and energy budgets of large baleen whales from the southern hemisphere (1981) Mammals in the Seas, 3, pp. 379-487. , In*Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.

Stranding data reveal the presence of two new species (Ziphius cavirostris and Hyperoodon planifrons) in addition to the nine previously identified (Eubalaena glacialis, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus, Mesoplodon layardii, Lagenorhynchus cruciger, Cephalorhynchus commersonii, Orcinus orca, and Globicephala melas). The occasional occurrence of Phocoena dioptrica is confirmed. Since 1989, the most important result is the large number of sightings (n=1649) of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) beyond the Kerguelen Island plateau, in an area rarely visited by fishing boats in the past. For the most common species, Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), distributional data are supplemented by biological and ecological informations. For three species (Physeter macrocephalus, Orcinus orca and Globicephala melas) we provide evidence of interactions with the longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.","Cetaceans; Fishery interactions; Kerguelen Islands; Southern Ocean","dolphin; fishery; geographical distribution; island; new record; new species; taxonomy; whale; French Southern Territories; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Kerguelen Islands; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cephalorhynchus commersonii; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Dissostichus eleginoides; Eubalaena glacialis; Globicephala melas; Hyperoodon planifrons; Lagenorhynchus cruciger; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon layardii; Orcinus orca; Phocoena dioptrica; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Ziphius cavirostris",,,,,,,"Angot, M., Observations sur les mammifères marins de l'archipel des Kerguelen (1954) Mammalia, 18, pp. 1-111; Ashford, J.R., Rubilar, P.S., Martin, A.R., Interactions between cetaceans and longline fishing operations around South Georgia (1996) Mar.

Bull and rat spermatozoa were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Vitrified-warmed bovine mature oocytes were subjected to immunostaining against α-tubulin 4-6 h after intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) of 5 mM dithiothreitol-treated spermatozoa. Aster formation occurred from whale spermatozoa (33%) and bull spermatozoa (33%), but very little from rat spermatozoa (3%). Activation treatment for the microinseminated oocytes with 7% ethanol + 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine resulted in a similar proportion of oocytes forming a whale sperm aster (35% vs 27% in the non-treated group; 4 h after ICSI) but a significantly larger aster (ratio of aster diameter to oocyte diameter, 0.57 vs 0.30 in the non-treated group). These results indicate that the centrosome introduced into bovine oocytes by whale spermatozoa contributes to the MTOC and that assembly of the microtubule network is promoted by oocyte activation. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.","Interspecies ICSI; Microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC); Minke whale; Sperm aster","tubulin; animal; Antarctica; article; cattle; centrosome; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; male; microtubule organizing center; physiology; rat; species difference; spermatozoon; whale; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Cattle; Centrosome; Male; Microtubule-Organizing Center; Rats; Species Specificity; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Spermatozoa; Tubulin; Whales; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Bovinae; Cetacea",,"Tubulin",,,,,"Amemiya, K., Iwanami, Y., Kobayashi, T., Terao, T., Fukui, Y., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Hochi, S., Acquirement of oocyte-activating factor in Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) spermatogenic cells, assessed by meiosis resumption of microinseminated mouse oocytes (2004) J.

In total, 508 hours of survey effort were completed, with 304.2 hours in Beaufort sea-state 3 or less. Two hundred and thirty one sightings of eight species - common dolphin Delphinus delphis (L.), Atlantic white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus (Gray), bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (Montagu), harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena (L.), Risso's dolphin Grampus griseus (Cuvier), pilot whale Globicephala melas (Traill), minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata (Lacepede) and fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (L.) - were recorded, totalling 2,933 individuals. The greatest diversity and relative abundance were recorded on the Rockall Bank where Atlantic white-sided dolphin was the most abundant species. The common dolphin was the most abundant species recorded on the continental shelf to the south-west of Ireland, while the relative abundance of cetaceans off the north coast was very low. The data suggest that cetacean species composition and relative abundance can vary greatly between adjacent marine habitat types and over relatively small geographical distances. © Royal Irish Academy.",,"Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Berrow, S., Biological diversity of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) in Irish waters (2001) Marine Biodiversity in Ireland and Adjacent Waters, pp. 115-119. , J.

Four species of cetaceans routinely used the area during the summer: White-beaked and Atlantic White-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris and L. acutus). Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The dolphin species were temporally separated, with White-beaked Dolphins being common earlier in the summer than White-sided Dolphins. White-sided Dolphins were unusually abundant in 1997, and were found in larger groups (mean = 46.5 ± 46.19 sd) than White-beaked Dolphins (mean = 9.1 ± 5.19 SD). The area also appears to be an important habitat for dolphin calves and juveniles of both species. Fin Whales (B. physalus) were commonly observed in relatively large groups in 1997, but were uncommon or absent in other years. Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Blue Whales (B. musculus) and North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were uncommon in the area, although Humpback Whales were sighted frequently in 1997. Increased numbers of White-sided Dolphins, Fin and Humpback whales in 1997 may be explained by increased prey abundance and decreased sea-surface temperatures.","Atlantic White-sided Dolphin; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Fin Whale; Harbour Porpoise; Humpback Whale; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera novaeangliae; Minke Whale; Phocoena phocoena; White-beaked Dolphin","abundance; dolphin; porpoise; prey availability; research vessel; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; whale; Canada; Halifax; North America; Nova Scotia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Megaptera; Megaptera novaeangliae; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Aguilar, A., Fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (2002) Encyclopedia of marine mammals, pp. 435-438. , Edited by W.

We found two types of Mb in the skeletal muscle of pantropical spotted dolphin: Mb I with the same amino acid sequence as that deposited in the protein database, and Mb II, which differs at two amino acid residues compared with Mb I. Using an alignment of the amino acid or cDNA sequences of cetacean Mb, we constructed a phylogenetic tree by the NJ method. Clustering of cetacean Mb amino acid and cDNA sequences essentially follows the classical taxonomy of cetaceans, suggesting that Mb sequence data is valid for classification of cetaceans at least to the family level. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The krill is the major grazer of diatoms. On the basis of fieldwork at Ross Island, we suggest that the cascade results from foraging by unusually numerous Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and fish-eating killer whales (Orcinus orca). These species and other top predators apparently deplete the krill and silverfish. In drawing our conclusions, we were aided by two ""natural experiments."" In one ""experiment,"" large, grounded icebergs altered the seasonal pattern of change in regional sea-ice cover, but not the seasonal change in penguin diet and foraging behavior that was also detected during the preiceberg era. In the other ""experiment,"" a short-term polynya (opening in the ice) brought penguins and whales together in a confined area, this time altering both penguin diet and foraging behavior. We conclude that the foraging of penguins and whales, and not a formerly hypothesized seasonal decrease in sea-ice cover, explains (1) the annual switch in the penguins' prey from krill to silverfish, (2) the subsequent lengthening of penguin foraging trips, and (3) a marked decline of cetaceans in the area later in the season. Reduction in the middle-trophic-level prey is expressed in the relaxed grazing pressure on phytoplankton. © 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.","Adélie Penguin; Antarctic silverfish; Antarctic toothfish; Antarctica; Crystal krill; Killer whale; Minke whale; Prey availability; Ross Sea; Sea ice; Trophic cascade; Trophic competition","cetacean; diatom; fish; foraging behavior; interspecific competition; prey availability; seabird; trophic cascade; whale; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Ross Island; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Delphinidae; Euphausia crystallorophias; Euphausiacea; Orcinus orca; Pleuragramma antarcticum; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., The biomass of birds and mammals in the Ross Sea, Antarctica (1985) Antarctic Nutrient Cycles and Food Webs, pp. 498-515. , W.

However, these data can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries, which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9 650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Generalized additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates. Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists. The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95% CI: 978-3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 (95% CI: 1 326-15 179) and minke whales was 1,544 (95% CI: 1,221-1,953). These estimates agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.

While variability is sufficient to allow recognition of individual whales, distinct colour elements consistently occur, including a light grey rostral saddle, dark grey spinal field and ivory white ventral field. Three dark lateral fields (nape field, continuing ventrally as a throat patch; thorax field; peduncle field) alternate with light grey thorax and flank patches and ivory white peduncle and shoulder blazes, the last variably in-filled by a dark axillary patch. The flipper has a diagnostic white basal blaze and dark grey distal patch. White mandible and eye blazes occur primarily on the right side. Cladistic analyses were run using 13 colour characters and 12 taxa (11 baleen whales, representing all families; outgroup: sperm whale Physeter). The relationships between baleen whale families were poorly reflected in the analysis and no monophyletic groups were extracted. However the analysis suggested that the common minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata and the dwarf minke whale are most closely related. The common minke, dwarf minke and Antarctic minke whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis were also united, as only those species shared a double caudal chevron and discrete light grey lateral patches (anterior thorax and posterior flank patch) separated by a dark thorax field. Light grey lateral pigment, blowhole streaks, ear stripes and a tendency for colour asymmetry characterised most species of Balaenoptera. Colour pattern and other available data support Rice's (1998) recognition of the dwarf minke whale as an as yet un-named subspecies of Balaenoptera acutorostrata.","Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Colouration; Phylogeny; Taxonomy","cladistics; color; phylogeny; taxonomy; whale; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Mysticeti; Physeter; Physeter catodon",,,,,,,"Agler, B.A., Beard, J.A., Bowman, R.S., Corbett, H.D., Frohock, S.E., Nawvermale, M.P., Katona, S.K., Seipt, I.E., Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) photographic identification: Methodology and preliminary results from the western North Atlantic (1990) Individual Recognition of Cetaceans: Use of Photoidentification and Other Techniques to Estimate Population Parameters, pp. 349-356. , Hammond, P.S., Mizroch, S.A. & Donovan, G.P.

Gulps were either restricted to the inter-mandibular area or involved expansion of the whole ventral pouch; the extent of filling appears to be under voluntary control. Gulps may have different functions, e.g. feeding or display. Maximum gape (about 70°) occurred during inter-mandibular gulps, involving both depression of the lower jaw and elevation of the head and upper jaw. The lower jaw was depressed only to about 40°, much less than the 90° generally illustrated in the literature for rorquals. The mouth was closed as the ventral pouch was still filling; closure was rapid, associated with the moderate depression of the lower jaw. The whole ventral pouch contracted uniformly to expel water. The fibrocartilage skeleton of the ventral pouch was involved in outpocketing of the mental (""chin"") region both at the beginning and end of gulps. During expulsion of water, partial axial rotation of the lower jaw maintained a groove just lateral to the baleen plates, opening as a vertical slit posteriorly. This would allow water expelled between the baleen plates to flow backwards, especially from the angle of the mouth. Incorporating these new observations, we discuss evolution of filter feeding and suggest that suction feeding was the primitive condition for baleen whales.","Balaenoptera; Evolution; Feeding; Functional morphology; Minke whale; Mysticeti","functional morphology; whale; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Andrews, R.C., Monographs of the Pacific Cetacea.2.

Very little, however, is known about how the physical forcing within these features affects their behaviour at a fine scale. During the summers of 2000 and 2002, we combined a series of cliff-top observations and boat-based surveys to describe the movements of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus and minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata within a predictable island wake occurring near Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. We recorded the location of fin and minke whales as they surfaced in or near the wake. We also examined the movements of individual fin whales using focal follow techniques to assess their habitat use within 3 distinct oceanographic regions (non-wake habitat, eddy habitat and free stream habitat) of the study area. Fin and minke whale occurrence was highest during flood tides and lowest during the mid-ebb phases. Fin (33) and minke whale (64) sightings were concentrated in areas characterised by slower current velocities - the region influenced by the eddy system formed within the wake. Nine individual fin whales, identified through photographs, spent a disproportionate amount of time within the eddy habitat portion of the study area, with occasional forays into free stream habitat.

Previously only recorded from deep-sea (1500-3000 m) whale-falls in the northeast Pacific, this is the first species of Osedax known from a shelf-depth whale-fall, and the first from the Atlantic Ocean. The new species, Osedax mucofloris sp. n., is abundant on the bones of an experimentally implanted Minke whale carcass (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) at 125 m depth in the shallow North Sea. O. mucofloris can be cultured on bones maintained in aquaria. The presence of O. mucofloris in the shallow North Sea and northeast Pacific suggests global distribution on whale-falls for the Osedax clade. Molecular evidence from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) and 18S rRNA sequences suggests that O. mucofloris has high dispersal rates, and provides support for the idea of whale-falls acting as 'stepping-stones' for the global dispersal of siboglinid annelids over ecological and evolutionary time. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Annelida; CO1; Pogonophora; Polychaeta; Siboglinidae","cytochrome c oxidase; ribosome RNA; bone; new species; polychaete; whale; animal tissue; annelid worm; article; Atlantic cod; bone; carcass; female; male; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; osedax mucofloris; priority journal; RNA sequence; Sweden; whale; worm; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Animalia; Annelida; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Gadus morhua; Polychaeta; Siboglinidae","GENBANK: AF168738, AF168739, AF168740, AF168741, AF168742, AF168743, AF168744, AF168745, AF168746, AF315060, AF315061, AF315062, AY340437, AY577885, AY577894, AY586486, AY586487, AY586488, AY586489, AY586490, AY586491, AY586492, AY586493, AY586494, AY586495, AY586496, AY586497, AY586498, AY586499, AY586500, AY586501, AY586502, AY586503, AY586504, AY586505, AY586506, AY586507, AY586508, AY586509, AY586510, AY611447, AY827562, AY827563, AY827564, AY827565, AY827566, AY827567, AY827568, AY941263","cytochrome c oxidase, 72841-18-0, 9001-16-5",,,,,"Avise, J.C., Lansman, R.A., Shade, R.O., Use of restriction endonucleases to measure mitochondrial-DNA sequence relatedness in natural populations.

The identification of food items was done using hard parts (i.e. fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks). Diet indices were computed including prey frequency and percentage by number. Common dolphins ate mainly gadoid fish (Trisopterus sp.), gobies and mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Cephalopods occurred in small numbers in the diet and commercially important species (cuttlefish and common squid) were scarce.",,"diet; dolphin; pinniped; porpoise; stomach content; stranding; Eastern Hemisphere; English Channel; Eurasia; Europe; France; Normandy; Western Europe; World; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cephalopoda; Cetacea; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; dolphin (whale); Gadiformes; Globicephala melas; Gobiidae; Halichoerus grypus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Mammalia; Phocoena; Phocoenidae; Scomber scombrus; Sepiidae; Stenella coeruleoalba; Trisopterus; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Blanco, C., Salomón, O., Raga, J.A., Diet of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the western Mediterranean Sea (2001) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 81, pp. 1053-1058; Clarke, M.R., (1986) A Handbook for the Identification of Cephalopod Beaks, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Collet, A., (1981) Biologie du Dauphin Commun Delphinus Delphis L. en Atlantique Nord-est, , PhD thesis, Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Coull, K.A., Jermyn, A.S., Newton, A.W., Henderson, G.I., Hall, W.B., Length/weight relationships for 88 species of fish encountered in the North East Atlantic (1989) Scottish Fisheries Research Report, 43, pp. 1-81; Desportes, G., (1985) La Nutrition des Odontocètes en Atlantique Nord-Est (Côles Françaises - Iles Feroë), , PhD thesis, Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Dorel, D., Poissons de l'atlantique Nord-est relations taillepoids (1986) Rapport Interne IFREMER, 165p; Härkönen, T.J., (1986) Guide to the Otoliths of the Bony Fishes of the Northeast Atlantic, , Hellerup: Danbui ApS; Liao, Y.Y., Lucas, M.C., Growth, diet and metabolism of common wolf-fish in the North Sea, a fast-growing population (2000) Journal of Fish Biology, 56, pp. 810-825; Mauger, G., Kerleau, F., Robin, J.P., Dubois, B., De Pierrepont, J.F., De Meersman, P., Custers, I., Marine debris obstructing stomach of a young minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) stranded in Normandy, France (2002) 8th American Cetacean Society.

Both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 cDNAs had an open reading frame of 516 amino acid residues, and predicted molecular masses were 58.3 kDa and 58.1 kDa, respectively. The deduced full-length amino acid sequence of CYP1A1 revealed higher identities with those of sheep (86%) and pig (87%), and that of CYP1A2 was most closely related to human (82%) and monkey CYP1A2 (82%) among species from which CYP1A2 has been isolated so far. Differences in certain conserved and functional amino acid residues of CYP1A1 and 1A2 between common minke whale and other mammalian species indicate the possibility of their specific metabolic function. Concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs) including PCBs and DDTs analyzed in common minke whale liver showed no significant correlation with hepatic mRNA expression levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, indicating no induction of these enzymes by such OCs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The present paper documents the identification, quantification, and synthesis of a novel compound, 2,2′-dimethoxy-3,3′,5,5′-tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2′-diMeO-BB80), present in the marine mammals Striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) caught in the Pacific Ocean. Identification was based on comparison of the relative retention times of the compound on two gas Chromatographic columns of different polarities to those of an authentic standard. Furthermore, this identification was also supported by comparison of the full scan mass spectrometric data collected employing electron ionization (EI), positive ion chemical ionization (PICI), and electron capture negative ionization (ECNI). The concentrations of 2,2′-diMeO-BB80 in the samples ranged from 12 to 800 ng/g lipid, making this consistently one of the most abundant compounds amongthose analyzed, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and methoxylated PBDEs. The known occurrence of 3,3′,5,5′-tetrabromo-2,2′-biphenyldiol (2,2′-diOH-BB80) in the marine environment as a natural product suggests that its methylated derivative, 2,2′-diMeO-BB80, is also of natural origin. To obtain the necessary authentic standards, synthesis was performed of 2,2′-diMeO-BB80 and the known natural product 2′,6-dimethoxy-2,3′,4,5′- tetrabromodiphenyl ether (2′,6-diMeO-BDE68). © 2005 American Chemical Society.",,"Electrons; Ionization; Mass spectrometry; Sampling; Scanning; Synthesis (chemical); Bioaccumulation; Electron capture negative ionization (ECNI); Polarities; Positive ion chemical ionization (PICI); Ethers; 2,2' dimethoxy 3,3',5,5' tetrabromobiphenyl; 2,6 dimethoxy 2,3',4,5' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 3,3',5,5' tetrabromo 2,2' biphenyldiol; hexabromocyclododecane; natural product; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; marine mammal; PBDE; animal tissue; article; bioaccumulation; chemical analysis; chemical structure; dolphin; electrospray mass spectrometry; gas chromatography; Japan; mammal; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; positive ion electrospray; quantitative assay; reaction analysis; standard; synthesis; whale; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Chromatography, Gas; Environmental Pollution; Hydrocarbons, Brominated; Japan; Mammals; Mass Spectrometry; Minke Whale; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Stenella; Whales; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Japan; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Berardius bairdii; Cetacea; dolphin (whale); Mammalia; Stenella coeruleoalba; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,"hexabromocyclododecane, 25637-99-4; Hydrocarbons, Brominated; pentabromodiphenyl ether, 32534-81-9; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls",,,,,"Struntz, W.D.J., Kucklick, J.R., Schantz, M.M., Becker, P.R., McFee, W.E., Stolen, M.K., Persistent organic pollutants in rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) sampled during an unusual mass stranding event (2004) Mar.

A question here is how they regulate water and mineral balances in marine habitats. In the present study, we determined blood and urine levels of various chemicals involved in osmoregulation, compared them with those in artiodactyls, and characterized the values in the whales. Blood and urine samples obtained from baleen whales of common minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), sei (B. borealis), and Bryde's whales (B. brydei), and toothed whales of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were analyzed for osmolality, major electrolytes, urea, steroid hormones and glucose. The urine osmolality and Na+ concentrations in the cetaceans were much higher than those in the cattle. Furthermore, the cetaceans had 5 to 11-fold urea in plasma than the cattle, and 2 to 4-fold urea in urine. There were no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of corticosteroids between the cetaceans and the cattle. The present results indicate that the osmoregulatory parameters seem to be not affected by the reproductive stage and sex steroid hormones. The concentrations of urea in plasma and urine of the baleen whales were higher than those of the sperm whales, indicating a possibility that their osmoregulatory mechanisms may be correlated to their feeding habits. The present results suggest that cetaceans have unique osmoregulatory mechanisms by which they excrete strongly hypertonic urine to maintain fluid homeostasis in marine habitats. © 2005 Zoological Society of Japan.","Cetaceans;

Examination of boing vocalizations from three research surveys confirms previous work that identified two distinct boing vocalization types in the North Pacific. The eastern boing (n=22) has a pulse repetition rate of 92 s -1 and a duration of 3.6 s and was found only east of 138°W. The central boing (n=106) has a pulse repetition rate of 115 s-1 and a duration of approximately 2.6 s and was found only west of 135°W. Central boing vocalizations produced by a single source (n=84) indicate that variation in repetition rate and duration of the calls of the individual were not significantly different than the variation among individuals of the same boing type. Despite a slight latitudinal overlap in the vocalizations, pulse repetition rates of the eastern and central boings were distinct.",,"Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic wave propagation; Surveys; Underwater acoustics; Cetacean survey; Minke whales; Pules repetition rates; Vocalization; Ocean habitats; acoustics; animal experiment; article; geographic distribution; measurement; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; priority journal; sound; sound detection; vocalization; whale; Acoustics; Animal Migration; Animals; Minke Whale; Pacific Ocean; Seasons; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,"Many thanks to the hard work and patience of the marine mammal observers, acoustic assistants, and crew aboard the R/V David Starr Jordan , R/V McArthur and the R/V McArthur II .

These in turn are related to shifts in the semi-annual and Antarctic oscillations. Populations of the two ecologically dissimilar penguin species - Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae and emperor Aptenodytes forsteri - have been tallied annually since the 1950s making these the longest biological datasets for the Antarctic. Both species are obligates of sea ice and, therefore, allowing for the demographic lags inherent in the response of long-lived species to habitat or environmental variation, the proximate mechanisms responsible for the shifts involved changes in coastal wind strength and air and sea temperatures, which in turn affected the seasonal formation and decay of sea ice and polynyas. The latter probably affected such rates as the proportion of adults breeding and ultimately the reproductive output of populations in ways consistent with the two species' opposing sea ice needs. Corresponding patterns for the mid-1970s shift were reflected also in ice-obligate Weddell seal Leptonychotes weddelli populations and the structure of shallow-water sponge communities in the Ross Sea. The 1988-89 shift, by which time many more datasets had become available, was reflected among several ice-frequenting vertebrate species from all Southern Ocean sectors. Therefore, the patterns most clearly identified in the Pacific Sector were apparently spread throughout the high latitudes of the Southern Ocean. © Antarctic Science Ltd.","Adélie penguin; Antarctic; Antarctic Oscillation; Climate change; Emperor penguin; Minke whale; Polynya; Regime shift; Sea ice; Southern Annular Mode; Weddell seal","Antarctic Oscillation; biota; climate change; sea ice; oceanic regions; Southern Ocean; World; Aptenodytes forsteri; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Leptonychotes weddellii; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Aebischer, N.J., Coulson, J.C., Colebrook, J.M., Parallel long-term trends across four marine trophic levels and weather (1990) Nature, 347, pp. 753-755; Ainley, D.G., (2002) The Adélie Penguin: Bellwether of Climate Change, 310p. , New York: Columbia University Press; Ainley, D.G., Divoky, G.J., Seabirds: Effects of climate change (2001) Encyclopaedia of Ocean Sciences, pp. 54-65. , STEELE, J., THORPE, S. & TAREKIAN, K., eds.

Moreover, the IVM culture period was shortened to 28-30 h from 96-120 h previously reported. The proportion of matured oocytes cultured in the medium supplemented with pFSH/E2 (26.7%) was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than that with PMSG/hCG (6.9%). The present study indicates that a portable CO2 incubator is a useful device for minke whale IVM culture on a research base ship, and the addition of pFSH/E2 into an IVM medium enhanced cumulus expansion and the proportion of minke whale matured oocytes.","Hormones;

Pursuits of minke whales were characterized by prolonged chases on a straight heading at velocities of 15-30 km/h. In four of the nine cases the adult-sized minke whale gradually outdistanced the killer whales, which abandoned the high-speed pursuit after 0.5-1 h. In one case the minke beached itself and died. Four attacks were successful. In one instance a subadult minke was killed in open water following a chase. In two cases the fleeing minke entered a confined bay and was killed by the killer whales. One adult minke was taken after apparently attempting to seek cover beside a large sailboat. Minke whales made no attempt to physically defend themselves and were killed by repeated ramming or by asphyxiation. Although killer whales are capable of sprinting speeds greater than those of minke whales, it appears that adult minkes can maintain higher sustained speeds and evade capture if sufficient space for an extended escape trajectory is available. Successful predation of minke whales in coastal waters is rare compared to pinnipeds and small cetaceans, the main prey of transient killer whales. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Hunting strategy; Orcinus orca; Predator evasion; Predator-prey interactions; Transient killer whales","antipredator defense; dolphin; predator-prey interaction; prey capture; whale; Alaska; British Columbia; Canada; North America; United States; Washington [United States]; Western Hemisphere; World; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Mammalia; Orcinus orca; Pinnipedia",,,,,,,"Angliss, R.P., Lodge, K.L., Alaska marine mammal stock assessments, 2003 (2004) NOAA Technical Memo NMFS-AFSC-144, 230p. , U.S. Department of Commerce; Arnbom, T., Papastavrou, V., Weilgart, L.S., Whitehead, H., Sperm whales react to an attack by killer whales (1987) Journal of Mammalogy, 68, pp. 450-453; Au, D., Weihs, D., At high speeds dolphins save energy by leaping (1980) Nature, 284, pp. 548-550; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Occurrence and behaviour of transient killer whales: Seasonal and pod-specific variability, foraging, and prey handling (1995) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 73, pp. 1300-1311; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., Ecological and social determinants of group size in transient killer whales (1996) Behavioral Ecology, 7, pp. 408-416; Baldridge, A., Killer whales attack and eat a gray whale (1972) Journal of Mammalogy, 53, pp. 898-900; Barrett-Lennard, L.G., Ford, J.K.B., Heise, K.A., The mixed blessing of echolocation: Differences in sonar use by fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales (1996) Animal Behavior, 51, pp. 553-565; Bigg, M.A., An assessment of killer whale (Orcinus orca) stocks off Vancouver Island, British Columbia (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 655-666; Bigg, M.A., Olesiuk, P.F., Ellis, G.M., Ford, J.K.B., Balcomb III, K.C., Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State (1990) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (12 SPEC.

Three assessment scenarios are performed and evaluated: (1) Default historic assessment where the natural mortality (M) is fixed, (2) assessment where natural mortality is estimated both for adult and juvenile herring, (3) assessment where consumption by minke whales is modelled and the predation and residual natural mortalities are estimated. The annual consumption of juvenile herring in the Barents Sea is estimated exogenously using diet data and a bioenergetic model. The estimated consumption is included in the objective function and the parameters determining the modelled consumption are estimated together with other free parameters of the model in a single operation. The estimated total natural mortality of juvenile herring is lower than the value assumed by the working group (M = 0.9) when either minke whales are included in the model (M = 0.49) or the parameter is estimated directly (M = 0.48). Assessment 3 generates 19% and 34% lower adult and juvenile stock sizes, respectively, than assessment 1, whereas assessments 2 and 3 generate relatively similar stock size estimates. The predation mortality constituted 45% and 10% of the total natural mortality of adult (M = 0.15) and juvenile herring (M = 0.49), respectively. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Stomach contents samples were obtained from ten animals. The diet comprised mainly sandeels (Ammodytidae, around two-thirds of the diet by number or weight) and clupeids (herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus).

Ovaries were harvested from 94 immature minke whales caught in the Antarctic Ocean during the summer feeding season (December-March). Notable differences in ovarian size and morphology were found among animals. Up to 10 folds difference in ovarian weight was found among prepubertal whales of similar body size. During the prepubertal period, ovaries grew slowly and approximately doubled their weight. The morphologies of right and left ovaries were almost identical while the growth of the ovary appears to occur preferentially on the right side. The most striking morphological feature was numerous small antral follicles less than 5 mm in diameter found in ovaries of younger immature whales. The occurrence of these ovaries was highest in whales less than 6 m long and gradually decreased as body length increased. In larger whales, the occurrence of ovaries with a smaller number of follicles up to 10 mm and thick tunica albuginea increased. Thus, the ovary of the Antarctic minke whale experiences bursts of small follicular development during the early prepubertal period before becoming a more developed ovary with fewer but larger follicles, and thick tunica albuginea.","Minke whale; Ovarian development; Whale","age determination; animal experiment; animal tissue; Antarctica; article; body size; female; immaturity; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; ovary development; ovary follicle development; prepuberty; tissue growth; tunica albuginea; weight; whale; animal; growth, development and aging; histology; ovary; physiology; sexual maturation; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Female; Ovary; Sexual Maturation; Whales",,,,,,,"Annex U: Report of the working group on nomenclature (2001) J Cetacean Res Manage, 3 (SUPPL.), pp. 363-367; Kato, H., Miyashita, T., Migration strategy of southern minke whales in relation to reproductive cycle estimated from foetal lengths (1991) Rep Int Whal Commn, 41, pp. 363-369; Kasamatsu, F., Nishiwaki, S., Ishikawa, H., Breeding areas and southbound migrations of southern minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata (1995) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 119, pp. 1-10; Ivashin, M.V., Mikhalev, Y.A., To the problem of the prenatal growth of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata of the Southern Hemisphere and of the biology of their reproduction (1978) Rep Int Whal Commn, 28, pp. 201-205; Best, P.B., Seasonal aboundance, feeding, reproduction, age and growth in minke whales off Durban (with incidental observations from the Antarctic) (1982) Rep Int Whal Commn, 32, pp. 759-786; Lockyer, C., Estimation of the energy costs of growth, maintenance and reproduction in the female minke whale, (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), from the southern hemisphere (1981) Rep Int Whal Commn, 31, pp. 337-343; Kato, H., Some biological parameters for the Antarctic minke whale (1982) Rep Int Whal Commn, 32, pp. 935-945; Mackintosh, N.A., Wheeler, J.F.G., Southern blue and fin whales (1929) Discovery Rep, 1, pp. 257-540; Laws, R.M., Reproduction, growth and age of southern fin whales (1961) Discovery Rep, 31, pp. 327-486; Gambell, R., Seasonal cycles and reproduction in sei whales of the southern hemisphere (1968) Discovery Rep, 35, pp. 131-134; Horwood, J.W., Chapter 9, Reproduction (1987) The Sei Whale: Population Biology, Ecology and Management, pp. 156-212. , Beckenham: Croom Helm; Chittleborough, R.G., Studies on the ovaries of the humpback whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre), on the western Australian coast (1954) Aust J Mar Freshw Res, 5, pp. 35-63; Lockyer, C., Observations on the ovary of the southern minke whale (1987) Sci Rep Whales Res Inst, 38, pp. 75-89; Ishikawa, H., Murase, H., Tohyama, D., Yuzu, S., Otani, S., Mogoe, T., Masaki, T., Kinoshita, T., (2000) Cruise Report of the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic (JARPA) Area IV and Eastern Part of Area III in 1999/2000, p. 25. , Paper SC/52/O20 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee; Asada, M., Tetsuka, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Improvement on in vitro maturation, fertilization and development of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 521-533; Ohsumi, S., Comparison of maturity and accumulation rate of corpora albicantia between left and right ovaries in Cetacea (1964) Sci Rep Whales Res Inst, 18, pp. 123-148; Pierson, R.A., Ginther, O.J., Follicular populations during the estrous cycle in Heifers II.

The causative agent, Brucella is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium of genus Brucella. Recently Brucella infection has been reported in a variety of wild animals including marine mammals. In the western North Pacific, pathological and serological investigations suggested Brucella infection occurred in common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). In the present study, infection with Brucella sp. was demonstrated in granular testes with caseation or calcification from the North Pacific whales using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Previous studies showed that terrestrial and North Atlantic seal isolates have omp2a and omp2b gene copies at outer membrane protein 2 gene locus, while North Atlantic cetacean isolates have two omp2b gene copies. The North Pacific whale Brucella has been shown to have omp2a and omp2b gene copies at the locus in this study, suggesting the similarity to terrestrial and North Atlantic seal isolates. However, the sequence of omp2b was different from those of known Brucella strains, and formed a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree of omp2 gene. The insertion of an IS777 transposable element downstream of bp26 gene is a common molecular feature to all marine isolates. The insertion was found in the North Pacific whale Brucella, suggesting its close relation to North Atlantic marine isolates. Furthermore, an identical DNA sequence, which is unique to North Atlantic seal isolates, was found in the North Pacific whale Brucella. These results together showed that the North Pacific Brucella was different from known Brucella strains, but was most similar to North Atlantic seal strains. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Antibodies; Bacteria; Database systems; Diseases; DNA; Enzymes; Genes; Polymerization; Brucella infection; Minke whale; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Zoonotic disease; Aquaculture; Antibodies; Bacteria; Diseases; Enzymes; Genes; Nucleic Acids; Polymerization",,,,,,,"Corbel, M.J., Bringley-Morgan, W.J., Genus brucella meyer and shaw 1920, 173AL (1984) Bergey's Manual of Systemic Bacteriology, 1, pp. 377-388. , N.R.

The four lipid contents (triglyceride, total cholesterol, phospholipids and non-esterified fatty acids) in vitrified immature oocytes from prepubertal and adult minke whales, and also in fresh and vitrified immature porcine oocytes, were measured. The lipid contents in vitrified-warmed minke whale oocytes were similarly high compared with those in vitrified-warmed porcine oocytes. In particular, the total cholesterol and phospholipid contents in the vitrified immature oocytes from prepubertal and adult minke whales were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those from prepubertal pigs. Furthermore, the distribution of lipid droplets in fresh and vitrified immature oocytes was observed in transmission electron microscopy. Lipid droplets in the prepubertal minke whale oocytes were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, adult minke whales had larger lipid droplets which were distributed mainly in the central portion of the cytoplasm. The lipid droplets of immature oocytes from prepubertal pigs were larger than those in minke whale oocytes. These results indicated that the difference in the distribution of the cytoplasmic lipid droplets may result in the difference in the color tone of both prepubertal and adult whale oocyte cytoplasm.","Lipid; Minke whale; Oocytes; Porcine; Sexual maturity","cholesterol; fatty acid; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; animal cell; article; cell ultrastructure; cellular distribution; color; comparative study; controlled study; cytoplasm; lipid analysis; nonhuman; oocyte; oocyte maturation; swine; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure analysis and electron microscopy; vitrification; whale; animal; freezing; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; sexual maturation; ultrastructure; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Animals; Freezing; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Oocytes; Sexual Maturation; Swine; Whales",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5",,,,,"Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Factors affecting in vitro maturation of minke whale (balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Biol Reprod, 56, pp. 523-528; Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., In vitro fertilization of in vitro matured minke whale (balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Mar Mamm Sci, 13, pp. 395-404; Asada, M., Horii, M., Mogoe, T., Fukui, Y., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., In vitro maturation and ultrastructural observation of cryopreserved minke whale (balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (2000) Biol Reprod, 62, pp. 253-259; Asada, M., Tetsuka, M., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Fukui, Y., Improvement on in vitro maturation, fertilization and development of minke whale (balaenoptera acutorostrata) oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 521-533; Homa, S.T., Racowsky, C., McGaughey, R.W., Lipid analysis of immature pig oocytes (1986) J Reprod Fertil, 77, pp. 425-434; McEvoy, T.G., Coull, G.D., Speake, B.K., Staines, M.E., Broadbent, P.J., Estimation of lipid and fatty acid composition of zona-intact pig oocytes (1997) J Reprod Fertil Abstract Series, 20, p. 10; McEvoy, T.G., Coull, G.D., Broadbent, P.J., Hutchinson, J.S., Speake, B.K., Fatty acid composition of lipids in immature cattle, pig and sheep oocytes with intact zona pellucida (2000) J Reprod Fertil, 118, pp. 163-170; Kim, J.Y., Kinoshita, M., Ohnishi, M., Fukui, Y., Lipid and fatty acid analysis of fresh and frozen-thawed immature and in vitro matured bovine oocytes (2001) Reproduction, 122, pp. 131-138; Didion, B.A., Pomp, D., Martin, M.J., Homanics, G.E., Markert, C.L., Observations on the cooling and cryopreservation of pig oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage (1990) J Anim Sci, 68, pp. 2803-2810; Liebermann, J., Nawroth, F., Isachenko, V., Isachenko, E., Rahimi, G., Tucker, M.J., Potential importance of vitrification in reproductive medicine (2002) Biol Reprod, 67, pp. 1671-1680; O'Brien, J.K., Dwarte, D., Ryan, J.P., Wmc, M., Evans, G., Developmental capacity, energy metabolism and ultrastructure of mature oocytes from prepubertal and adult sheep (1996) Reprod Fertil Dev, 8, pp. 1029-1037; Marchal, R., Feugang, J.M., Perreau, C., Venturi, E., Terqui, M., Mermillod, P., Meiotic and developmental competence of prepubertal and adult swine oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 17-29; Khatir, H., Lonergan, P., Carolan, C., Mermillod, P., Prepubertal bovine oocyte: A negative model for studying oocyte developmental competence (1996) Mol Reprod Dev, 45, pp. 231-239; Revel, F., Mermillod, P., Peynot, N., Renard, J.P., Heyman, Y., Low developmental capacity of in vitro matured and fertilized oocytes from calves compared with that of cows (1995) J Reprod Fertil, 103, pp. 115-120; Bligh, E.G., Dyer, W.J., A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification (1959) Can J Biochem Physiol, 39, pp. 911-917; Sathananthan, A.H., Kirby, C., Trounson, A., Philipatos, D., Shaw, J., The effects of cooling mouse oocytes (1992) J Assist Reprod Genet, 9, pp. 139-148; Sathananthan, A.H., Ultrastructural changes during meiotic maturation in mammalian oocytes: Unique aspects of the human oocyte (1994) Microsc Res Tech, 27, pp. 145-164; Casella, J.F., Flanagan, M.D., Lin, S., Cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization and induces depolymerization of actin filaments formed during platelet shape change (1981) Nature, 293, pp. 302-305; Nagashima, H., Kashiwazaki, N., Ashman, R.J., Grupen, C.G., Seamark, R.F., Nottle, M.B., Removal of cytoplasmic lipid enhances the tolerance of porcine embryos to chilling (1994) Biol Reprod, 51, pp. 618-622; Nagashima, H., Kashiwazaki, N., Ashman, R.J., Grupen, C.G., Nottle, M.B., Cryopreservation of porcine embryos (1995) Nature, 374, p. 416; Alberts, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., Watson, J.D., (1995) Molecular Biology of the Cell.

Blood samples and testes were collected from common minke (n=39 for blood samples, n=15 for testes) and Bryde's (n=14 for blood samples, n=7 for testes) whales captured from May 2001 to August 2001 in the Western North Pacific. Serum T concentrations, in 35.9% of the common minke and 57.1% of Bryde's whales, were below the detection limit (&lt; 2.5 pg/ml). There were no significant differences in the serum concentrations of E 2, FSH, and LH among immature, mature common minke and Bryde's whales except that LH levels of immature Bryde's whales was higher than those of common minke whales. In most seminiferous tubules of mature whales, only a single-layer of spermatogonia was observed. However, spermatozoa were observed in seminiferous tubules in 2/13 of mature common minke and 4/4 of mature Bryde's whales with the low or undetectable T levels. These results indicate that the low serum T concentrations reflect the inactivity of spermatogenesis in both baleen whales, and that it is not possible to assess gonadal activity in either common minke or Bryde's whales using serum sex hormone concentrations during the feeding season.","FSH;

In rams, highly significant correlations were observed in the percentage of motile spermatozoa (P<0.01) and sperm concentration (P<0.01) between the standard and SQA methods. But, the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa did not significantly correlate between the standard and SQA methods. The percentages of swollen spermatozoa at 15 minutes by the HOS test were significantly correlated with the motility by the standard (P<0.05) and by the SQA (P<0.05) methods. For minke whale spermatozoa, the SVI (sperm viability index) values by the standard method were significantly (P<0.001) correlated with the sperm motility index (SMI) values by SQA. The percentage of motile spermatozoa was also significantly correlated (P<0.01) with the motility measured by SQA. Using different hypo-osmotic solutions and incubation times, the HOS test with 25, 100 and 150 mOsM did not show significant variations. Motility observed by the standard method and the percentage of swollen spermatozoa were significantly correlated (P0.05). These results indicate that the SQA and HOS test can be utilized to assess the post-thawing motility of ram and minke whale spermatozoa, and that the SQA and HOS test values are significantly correlated in ram spermatozoa. However, sperm concentration and morphologically normal spermatozoa are not assessed accurately by SQA in minke whales.","Frozen sperm; Hypo-osmotic swelling test; Minke whale; Sheep; Sperm quality analyzer","animal cell; article; cell viability; controlled study; equipment; hypoosmotic swelling test; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; semen analysis; sensitivity analysis; sheep; sperm quality analyzer; spermatozoon; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; whale; animal; animal disease; cryopreservation; cytology; drug effect; health care facility; male; osmotic pressure; physiology; sheep; species difference; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; validation study; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Ovis aries; hypotonic solution; Animals; Cryopreservation; Hypotonic Solutions; Male; Osmotic Pressure; Sheep; Species Specificity; Sperm Banks; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Whales",,"Hypotonic Solutions",,,,,"Bartoov, B., Ben-Barak, J., Mayevsky, A., Sneider, M., Yogev, L., Lightman, A., Sperm motility index: A new parameter for human sperm evaluation (1991) Fertil Steril, 56, pp. 108-112; Bartoov, B., Kalay, D., Mayevsky, A., Sperm motility analyzer (SMA) a practical tool of motility and cell concentration determinations in artificial insemination centers (1981) Theriogenology, 15, pp. 173-182; Braundmeier, A.G., Miller, D.J., Accurate molecular markers of male fertility: Where do we go from here?

In Australia, with whale-watchers approaching one million per annum there has been considerable effort to develop management regimes that protect the whales while enabling the development of a sustainable ecotourism industry. A mixture of National and State laws and regulations have governed the industry (Tourism based on free-ranging marine wildlife: opportunities and responsibilities, Wildlife Tourism Research Report No. 11, Status Assessment of Wildlife Tourism in Australia Series, CRC for Sustainable Tourism, Gold Coast, Queensland) but these have been mainly derived from experiences with humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whale watching from vessels at sea. In this article we describe the development and nature of new and rapidly growing swim-with-whales operations based on the dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Great Barrier Reef of northern Queensland. The distinctly different quality of these operations raise interesting questions for long-term management (Towards sustainable management of the developing dwarf minke whale tourism industry in northern Queensland, CRC Reef Research Technical Report 27, James Cook University of North Queensland, 30pp (emended version of SC/50/WW1)). In the 1999-2000 seasons, 453 passengers (88.1% of respondents) swam with minke whales. Only 25% of visitors came specifically for the whale interactions and 43% learned of the whales on board the vessel. Passengers thus had low expectations about whales and encounters. A variety of factors, including the diving experience, particular dive sites, a range of wildlife species and socializing contributed to visitor satisfaction. Nonetheless, there was a significant correlation between visitor satisfaction and closeness of approaches by the whales, total number of whales seen and total time spent with whales. We discuss the key issues associated with swim-with-whales programs in the light of our findings. The cooperative engagement of tourism operators, researchers and government management agencies is a feature of this new industry. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular analysis of marine mammalian Brucella strains, without manifest pathology of brucellosis in the eastern North Atlantic, showed that they are distinct from terrestrial Brucella species. Previously, we reported abnormal gonads in common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the western North Pacific and suggested the presence of Brucella infection in the whales in pathology and serology studies. In the present study, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Brucella was detected in granular testes of the whales showing caseation or calcification. The insertion of an IS711 transposable element specific for marine mammal isolates as well as a seal isolate-specific DNA fragment were also found. Molecular characterization of Brucella based on sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the outer membrane protein (omp) 2 gene showed that the Brucella from North Pacific common minke whales was different from terrestrial and North Atlantic marine mammal Brucella strains. The North Pacific Brucella showed the highest similarity to North Atlantic seal strains among the known Brucella strains. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

The post-warm COCs with normal morphology were cultured for 40 h in a 390 mosmol in vitro maturation medium, and oocytes extruding the first polar body were considered to be matured. The proportion of morphologically normal COCs after vitrification and warming was higher when the COCs were cryopreserved by Cryotop (adult origin, 88.4%; prepubertal origin, 80.8%) compared with the OPS (adult origin, 67.7%; prepubertal origin, 64.2%). The oocyte maturation rate was higher in the adult/Cryotop group (29.1%) compared with those of the prepubertal/Cryotop group (14.4%), the adult/OPS group (14.3%) and the prepubertal/OPS group (10.6%).

There were no significant differences among the proportions of pseud-pronucleus (PPN) formation of whale SCNT oocytes, intraspecies SCNT oocytes and parethenotes. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the cleavage rates of whale SCNT embryos between 6-dimethylaminopurin (DMAP) and cycloheximide (CHX) as secondary activation treatments. In effects of different donor cell types (viable or non-viable cells) on whale SCNT embryos, there was no significant difference in the cleavage rates of whale SCNT embryos between the two cell types. Two- to four-cell stages of whale SCNT embryos were obtained, but none of the embryos reached the blastocyst stage. The cleaved whale embryos were confirmed to have whale genomic DNA. From the results, it was shown that both bovine and porcine oocyte cytoplasms have the potential to form PPN and to produce cleaved whale interspecies SCNT embryos, regardless of the survivability of donor cells.",,"6 n,n dimethyladenine; cycloheximide; genomic DNA; animal cell; article; blastocyst; cattle; cell nucleus transplantation; cell survival; cell viability; cytoplasm; embryo development; interspecific hybridization; nonhuman; oocyte cleavage; parthenogenesis; priority journal; pronucleus; swine; whale; Adenine; Animals; Blastomeres; Cattle; Cell Nucleus; Cycloheximide; Embryo; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Male; Oocytes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Swine; Whales; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Bos taurus; Bovinae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa",,"6 n,n dimethyladenine, 938-55-6; cycloheximide, 642-81-9, 66-81-9; Adenine, 73-24-5; Cycloheximide, 66-81-9; N(6),N(6)-dimethyladenine, 938-55-6; Protein Kinase Inhibitors",,,,,"Asada, M., Horii, M., Mogoe, T., In vitro maturation and ultrastructural observation of cryopreserved minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (2000) Biol Reprod., 62, pp. 253-259; Asada, M., Tetsuka, M., Ishikawa, H., Improvement on in vitro maturation, fertilization and development of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) oocytes (2001) Theriogenology, 56, pp. 521-533; Asada, M., Wei, H., Nagayama, R., An attempt at intracytoplasmic sperm injection of frozen-thawed minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) oocytes (2001) Zygote, 9, pp. 299-307; Bui, L.C., Vignon, X., Campion, E., Use of interspecies nuclear transfer to study the early embryonic development and nuclear activities of the endangered species.

Interviews were conducted in both rural island and coastal communities and a major city. The majority of interviewees (46%) underestimated the number of cetacean species occurring in western Scottish waters (i.e. <10 species). Only 4.4% gave the correct answer (24). Location of the participant affected the level of knowledge. Photographs were presented of the four most commonly occurring cetacean species: only 30.2% correctly identified one or more of the species. The species most frequently identified correctly was the bottlenose dolphin (19% of interviewees) followed by the harbour porpoise (17.5%), minke whale (10.7%) and, lastly, the common dolphin (7.1%). Interviewees were also asked whether certain cetacean species occurred in local waters or not. The level of awareness was generally low. The most common positive answers involved the bottlenose dolphin, harbour porpoise, and minke whale. Only one in five were aware of killer whales and 13.1% believed that grey whales occurred in Scottish waters. Knowledge of species occurrence showed statistically significant relationships with age, gender, level of environmental interest and location, but not occupation (teachers, tourism professionals and marine stakeholders did not show greater levels of cetacean knowledge). The study identified target groups and locations where knowledge of cetaceans is low and environmental education efforts should be concentrated.",,"cetacean; knowledge; questionnaire survey; species diversity; species occurrence; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Eschrichtiidae; Mammalia; Phocoenidae; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Hickin, V., Cetaceans and sealife (2000) British Wildlife, 12, pp. 49-50; Parsons, E.C.M., Warburton, C.A., Woods-Ballard, A., Hughes, A., Johnston, P., The value of conserving whales: The impacts of whale-watching on the economy of rural West Scotland (2003) Aquatic Conservation, 13, pp. 397-415; Shrimpton, J.H., Parsons, E.C.M., (2000) Cetacean Conservation in West Scotland, , Mull: Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust","Parsons, E.C.M.; Dept. of Environ.

R., Norway","Baleen is an incrementally-growing tissue of balaenopteran whales which preserves relatively well over time in museums and some archeological sites, and, therefore might be useful for studies examining long-term changes of metal levels in whales. This study examined Hg and stable C and N isotopic composition of baleen plates of the North Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which continues to be a food source for people in Greenland and elsewhere. We compared the Hg levels and stable isotopes of major tissues (kidney, liver and muscle) with those of baleen plates to see whether baleen could be used as a biomonitor of variations of Hg intake and diet both between individuals and within individuals over time. Mercury was significantly correlated with concentrations in all tissues (kidney, liver and muscle). Stable C and N isotopes in baleen were generally similar to those of muscle, which reflects the recent (approximately one month) feeding of the whale, but in some individuals there were significant differences between baleen and muscle. Sectioning of baleen into 1 cm longitudinal increments showed that these differences were due to marked dietary shifts by some individuals over time that had been recorded in the baleen but were lost from the muscle record. Whole baleen C and N isotopes were better correlated with tissue Hg levels, suggesting that baleen may provide a more reliable indicator of long-term average diet, which in turn may be better related to Hg accumulation in tissues than the shorter-term diet record contained in muscle. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The data were obtained during the second phase of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). Of the chlorobenzenes, hexachlorobenzene was the main constituent detected in almost all samples. The chlorobenzenes accumulate in the marine food web in a similar manner to the better-studied persistent organic pollutants, with maximum concentrations in beluga, minke whale and narwhal. However, concentrations in ringed seals and kittiwakes were lower than in marine fish, contradicting biomagnification. Of the organochlorine pesticides, the drin pesticides (aldrin, endrin, dieldrin) and heptachlor had increasing concentrations along the food chain, whilst biomagnification was less pronounced for endosulfan, methoxychlor and mirex. Endosulfan and methoxychlor are pesticides still in use and considered less persistent than other organochlorine pesticides. Their occurrence in Arctic biota is of particular concern, also given the high acute toxicity of endosulfan to fish. Chlorobenzene and pesticide concentrations tended to be lower in the Greenland samples than in the same animals from the Canadian Arctic, whilst their concentrations were similar to samples from Svalbard and Iceland. However, temporal trends might overlap the geographical differences. Coplanar chlorobiphenyls (CBs) were found in all samples analysed, with the maximum concentrations found in marine mammals such as beluga and narwhal. Biota from the terrestrial environment appeared to be less contaminated. The main contributor on a TEQ basis was CB126. OCS, HCBD and PCA were detected in biota from Greenland, although at very low concentrations. OCS seems to have the widest occurrence and the highest potential for biomagnification of the three compounds analysed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Survey effort amounted to 42 342.5 km, and 850 minke whale encounters were recorded. Data were analysed in relation to undersea topography and seabed sediment type using multiple logistic regression. The effect of potential minke whale prey distribution was inferred from maps predicting suitable habitats for the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus and herring Clupea harengus constructed using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Whale distribution changed with season, and this may be a response to a shift in prey preferences. In spring, sediment type was a significant predictor of whale presence and sightings predominated over mixtures of gravel/sand seabed sediments. This distribution closely matched that of the sandeel, which is dependent on suitable winter settlement grounds. Throughout summer, the distribution of the minke whale underwent considerable change. In June, minke whales were predominately distributed over the sandeel habitat, but in July they dispersed to the predicted pre-spawning herring habitat, clustering in that area by August. In the waters around Mull, shifts in prey distribution and abundance occur between March and November and are the most likely factor governing the distribution and abundance of the minke whale.","Bathymetry; Geographical Information System; Herring; Minke whale; Sandeel; Seabed sediment","GIS; perciform; population distribution; prey availability; seafloor mapping; seasonal variation; sediment; whale; Argyll and Bute; Eurasia; Europe; Mull; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Ammodytes; Ammodytes marinus; Ammodytes marinus; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea; Clupea harengus; Clupea harengus; Mammalia; Perciformes; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Bjorndal, T., Conrad, J.M., A report on the Norwegian minke whale hunt (1998) Mar Pollut, 22, pp. 161-174; Blaxter, J.H.S., The herring (1990) Biologist, 37, pp. 27-31; Borja, A., Uriarte, A., Egana, J., Environmental factors and recruitment of mackerel Scomber scombrus L. 1758 along the north-east Atlantic coasts of Europe (2002) Fish Oceanogr, 11, pp. 116-127; Christensen, I., Rørvik, C.J., Results from markings of minke whales in the northeast Atlantic (1980) Rep Int Whal Comm, 30, pp. 201-203; Collet, D., (1991) Modelling Binary Data, 3rd Edn., , Chapman & Hall, London; Dorsey, E.M., Exclusive adjoining ranges in individually identified minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Washington State (1983) Can J Zool, 61, pp. 174-181; (1999) ArcView GIS 3.2, , Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA; Forney, K.A., Trends in harbour porpoise abundance off central California, 1986-1995: Evidence for interannual changes in distribution (1999) J Cetacean Res Manag, 1 (1), pp. 73-80; Gaskin, D.E., (1982) The Ecology of Whales and Dolphins, , Heinemann Educational Books, London; Gill, A., (1994) The Photoidentification of the Minke Whale (Balaenoptera Acutorostrata) off the Isle of Mull, Scotland, , MSc thesis, University of Aberdeen, Scotland; Gill, A., Fairbairns, B.R., Fairbairns, R.S., Some observations of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) feeding behaviour and associations with seabirds in the coastal waters of the Isle of Mull (2000) Eur Res Cetaceans, 13, pp. 61-64; Gill, A., Reid, R.J., Fairbairns, B.R., Photographic and strandings data highlighting the problem of marine debris and creel rope entanglement to minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and other marine life in Scottish waters (2001) Eur Res Cetaceans, 14, pp. 173-178; Hamazaki, T., Spatiotemporal prediction models of cetacean habitats in the mid-western North Atlantic Ocean (from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA to Nova Scotia, Canada) (2002) Mar Mamm Sci, 18, pp. 920-939; Haug, T., Gjøsæter, H., Lindstrøm, U., Nilssen, K., Diet and food availability for northeast Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) during the summer of 1992 (1995) ICES J Mar Sci, 52, pp. 77-86; Haug, T., Gjøsæter, H., Lindstrøm, U., Nilssen, K.T., Rottingen, I., Spatial and temporal variations in Northeast Atlantic minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata feeding habits (1995) Whales, Seals, Fish and Man, , Blix AS, Walloe L, Ulltang Ø (eds) Elsevier Science, Amsterdam; Haug, T., Lindstrøm, U., Nilssen, K.T., Variations in minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) diet and body condition in response to ecosystem changes in the Barents Sea (2003) Sarsia, 87, pp. 409-422; Hislop, J.R.G., Harris, M.P., Smith, J.G.M., Variation in calorific value and total energy content of the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus and other fish preyed on by seabirds (1991) J Zool, 224, pp. 501-517; Hoelzel, A.R., Dorsey, E.M., Stern, S.J., The foraging specializations of individual minke whales (1989) Anim Behav, 38, pp. 786-794; Hooker, S.K., Whitehead, H., Gowans, S., Marine protected area design and the spatial and temporal distribution of cetaceans in a submarine canyon (1999) Consen Biol, 13, pp. 592-602","Macleod, K.; Sea Mammal Research Unit, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife KY16 8LB, United Kingdom; email: km53@st-andrews.ac.uk",,,"Inter-Research",,,,,01718630,,MESED,,"English","Mar.

In this study, we constructed a cDNA library from the liver of minke whale from the North Pacific, and further screened a total of 6930 clones randomly selected in the library for the isolation of cDNA clones encoding novel members of CYP superfamily. The screening revealed the isolation of six novel CYP cDNA clones that are classified into CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP3A, CYP4, and CYP4A subfamilies. The BLAST homology search using the partial cDNA fragments of four CYP subfamilies (CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP2E and CYP4A) demonstrated that the minke whale CYPs were most closely related to pig CYPs (81-91%). Identification of multiple CYP genes in marine mammal species such as minke whale will provide new insights into the metabolic or toxicological functions of individual CYP members. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are mostly solitary animals and are only available for observation at moments when they surface to breath. Thus, a stochastic point process model is developed for how the data are generated. The hazard probability of initially sighting a whale that surfaces depends on relative spatial coordinates and on other covariates. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximum likelihood. To account for interannual variation in spatial distribution of minke whales, a random effects model is developed and estimated by comparing current and past (1989 and 1995) survey data. A simulation approach is taken to remove bias from parameter estimates and to assess the uncertainty in the results. For total abundance, the result is a log-normal confidence distribution with quantiles 107 205-exp(0.137z), i.e., an abundance estimate of 107 205 with a coefficient of variation of =0.14. Together with these and earlier survey data, past data on catch, mark-recapture, and satellite tracking are reviewed to elucidate distribution and migration patterns in Northeastern Atlantic minke whales.",,"abundance; spatiotemporal analysis; species occurrence; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Beddington, J.R., Cooke, J.G., Christensen, I., Øritsland, T., Øien, N., Rørvik, C.J., Assessments of the Northeast Atlantic stock of minke whales (1984) Rep.

Complex surfaces of the mandibles and craniums of 4 minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) were plotted in 3 dimensions by close-range photogrammetry. Photogrammetric data sets representing naturally opposed borders of the mandible and maxilla were used to determine 3-dimensional (3D) conformal coordinate transformations. These allowed the creation of precise 3D computer models of the skulls in which the strongly bowed mandibles were closely opposed along their entire length to the curved lateral borders of the rostrum. This simulated mouth closure. Subsequent internal measurements demonstrated a biomechanical specialization heretofore unknown in the class Mammalia - a maxillomandibular cam articulation. This novel articulation would operate as an adjunct to the temporomandibular joint in the final stage of mouth closure. Our functional interpretation is that it is at least a mechanism by which the energy cost of carrying a gigantic, expandable mouth at speed through an aqueous medium could be kept to a minimum. This articulation also may be part of a critically important trigger mechanism needed for precisely timed deployment of the feeding apparatus while it is under high hydrodynamic loads. We suggest that this evolutionary innovation was the root enabling cause of the adaptive radiation of rorquals (Balaenopteridae).","Anatomy; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Key evolutionary innovation; Rorqual","anatomy; evolution; marine mammal; morphology; whale; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenopteridae; Cetacea; Mammalia; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Árnason, U., Gulberg, A., Widegren, B., Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: Sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species (1993) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 10, pp. 960-970; Beauregard, H., L'articulation temporomaxillaire chez les Cetaces (1882) Journale de L'Anatomie et la Physiologie, 18, pp. 16-26; Berta, A., Sumich, J.L., (1999) Marine Mammals: Evolutionary Biology, , Academic Press, London, United Kingdom; Carte, A., MaCalister, A., On the anatomy of Balaenoptera rostrata (1868) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 185, pp. 201-261; Gaskin, D.E., The evolution, zoogeography and ecology of Cetacea (1976) Oceanography and Marine Biology Annual Review, 14, pp. 247-346; Gaskin, D.E., (1982) The Ecology of Whales and Dolphins, , Heinemann, London, United Kingdom; Hunter, J., On the structure and oeconomy of whales (1787) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 77, pp. 307-352; Kellogg, R., The history of whales - Their adaptation to life in water (1928) Quarterly Review of Biology, 3, pp. 174-208; Kreiton, K.J., Hintz, R.J., Lambertsen, R.H., Creation of a three dimensional model of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) baleen rack using close range photogrammetry (1990) American Congress on Surveying and Mapping/American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Technical Papers, 5, pp. 67-75; Lambertsen, R.H., Internal mechanism of rorqual feeding (1983) Journal of Mammalogy, 64, pp. 76-88; Lambertsen, R.H., The rorqual paradox (2001) Journal of Morphology, 248, p. 253; Lambertsen, R.H., Hintz, R.J., Rorqual paradox solved by discovery of novel craniomandibular articulation (2001) Journal of Morphology, 248, p. 253; Lambertsen, R.H., Hintz, R.J., Kreiton, K.J., Use of close range photogrammetry in characterizing the functional morphology of filter feeding in bowhead whales (1990) American Congress on Surveying and Mapping/American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Technical Papers, 5, pp. 86-95; Lambertsen, R.H., Ulrich, N., Straley, J., Frontomandibular stay of Balaenopteridae: A mechanism for momentum recapture during feeding (1995) Journal of Mammalogy, 76, pp. 877-899; Lillie, D.G., Cetacea.

Primordial follicles had already appeared in a 20 cm fetus and primary follicles were observed in a 50 cm fetus. In a 70 cm fetus, the number of primordial and primary follicles increased rapidly and secondary follicles were present. The concentrations of LH and FSH did not change between 20 cm and 160 cm in fetal length. When the fetal length became &gt; 70 cm, serum levels in the fetus, umbilical cord and mothers, and E2 levels in umbilical cord increased synchronously (p &lt; 0.05). These results showed increases in the number of preantral follicles in the Antarctic minke whale fetal ovary along with fetal growth during the early gestation period. These findings suggest that the change in preantral follicles was associated with changes in the concentration of steroids in early gestation periods. The changes in steroid concentrations in the fetal and umbilical cord blood and the increased number of preantral follicles were coincident at around 70 cm in fetal length, whereas the growth and differentiation of primordial and primary follicles appeared to be independent of FSH and LH.","Gonadotropins; Minke whale; Preantral follicle; Steroids","androstenedione; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; progesterone; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell differentiation; controlled study; female; fetus; fetus growth; fetus heart; maternal blood; nonhuman; ovary; pregnancy; steroid blood level; umbilical cord; whale; Androstenedione; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Estradiol; Female; Fetal Blood; Fetal Heart; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Gestational Age; Hormones; Luteinizing Hormone; Ovarian Follicle; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Whales; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea",,"androstenedione, 26264-53-9, 63-05-8; estradiol, 50-28-2; follitropin, 9002-68-0; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; progesterone, 57-83-0; Androstenedione, 63-05-8; Estradiol, 50-28-2; Follicle Stimulating Hormone, 9002-68-0; Hormones; Luteinizing Hormone, 9002-67-9; Progesterone, 57-83-0",,,,,"Abir, R., Franks, S., Mobberley, M.A., Moore, P.A., Margara, R.A., Winston, M., Mechanical isolation and in vitro growth of preantral and small antral follicles (1997) Fertil.

A total of 8,135 mature A. simplex were collected from 24 minke whales, 11 porpoises and eight pilot whales. For both males and females, the prevalence was 100% for all three host species, with a mean intensity of 1 ,727, 262 and 139, respectively. The mean body length of adult female A. simplex was 126 mm in minke whales, 71 mm in the porpoises and 73 mm in pilot whales; and for males the averages were, respectively, 106 mm, 57 mm and 68 mm. Eggs from the uteri of 32 females of length 87-176 mm collected in minke whale stomachs were counted in a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber. Total egg production was measured in 14 females cultivated at sea. The female growth period was estimated to be 30-60 days, and apparently all eggs were shed during the last week of life. A female of size 150 mm produces approximately 1.5 million eggs. In the cultivation experiment, about 85% of the total egg production was shed during the first 3 days after spawning started. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Anisakis; article; Atlantic Ocean; body height; body size; controlled study; egg production; female; female fertility; growth period; growth rate; male; male fertility; nonhuman; parasite development; porpoise; priority journal; sex ratio; spawning; species cultivation; stomach; whale; Animals; Anisakiasis; Anisakis; Atlantic Ocean; Dolphins; Female; Fertility; Male; Parasite Egg Count; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Porpoises; Sex Ratio; Whales; Anisakidae; Anisakis simplex; Ascaridoidea; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Globicephala melas; Nematoda; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae",,,,,,,"Berland, B., Nematodes of some Norwegian marine fishes (1961) Sarsia, 2, pp. 1-50; Bush, A.O., Lafferty, K.D., Lotz, J.F., Shostak, A.W., Parasitology meets ecology on its own terms: Margolis et al. revisited (1997) J Parasitol, 84, pp. 575-583; Dailey, M.D., Walker, W.A., Parasitism as a factor in single strandings of southern California cetaceans (1978) J Parasitol, 64, pp. 593-596; Davey, J.T., A revision of the genus Anisakis Dujardin, 1845 (Nematoda: Ascaridata) (1971) J Helminthol, 45, pp. 51-72; Grabda, J., Studies on the life cycle and morphogenesis of Anisakis simplex (Rudolphi, 1809), (Nematoda: Anisakidae) cultured in vitro (1976) Acta Ichthyol Pisc, 4, pp. 119-141; Højgaard, D.P., Impact of temperature, salinity and light on hatching of eggs of Anisakis simplex (Nematoda, Anisakidae), isolated by a new method, and some remarks on survival of larvae (1998) Sarsia, 83, pp. 21-28; Højgaard, D.P., No significant development of Anisakis simplex (Nematoda, Anisakidae) eggs in the intestinal tract of long-finned pilot whale, Globicephahala maelas (Traill, 1809).

The whales were caught in the North Atlantic during May-September 1992-1995. Serum progesterone (P) and testosterone (T) concentrations were measured and compared with anatomical data. The frequency distribution of female serum P values showed two clusters, one consisting mainly of immature animals and the second of pregnant ones, with mean serum values of about 0.49 ± 0.04 (SE) and 44.2 ± 2.84 nmol·L-1, respectively. The frequency distribution of male serum T did not show any group-specific distribution during the hunting season. The mean serum T value for the males was 0.63 ± 0.13 nmol·L-1. Contrary to earlier reports on the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), serum T values rose during the hunting season in mature males (p &lt; 0.0001). Serum P values in immature females increased during the season (p = 0.015). This increase agrees with the predominantly annual reproduction cycle of minke whales. Blood sex hormone measurements seem to be useful for detecting cyclic changes and pregnancy of minke whales.",,"blood; hormone; testosterone; whale; Animalia; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Adams, G.P., Comparative patterns of follicle development and selection in ruminants (1999) J.

Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are seldom seen at sea due to their oceanic distribution, deep diving ability, elusive behaviour, and possible low abundance. Gray's beaked whale is the most common beaked whale species to strand in New Zealand but observations of live animals in these waters are rare. Colour pattern and behaviour of these little known cetaceans are described. Although both animals appeared to be in good condition, the adult female had a series of deep corrugated scars behind her dorsal fin, likely the result of a ship strike. Other at‐sea sightings of this species from International Whaling Commission (IWC)—International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) minke whale assessment cruises and IWC—Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research (SOWER) circumpolar cruises are summarised. A cluster of sightings to the south‐west of the Chatham Islands may indicate the existence of a “hotspot” forM. grayi in the New Zealand region. © 2004 Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand.","Behaviour; Chatham Islands; Colour pattern; New Zealand; Ship strike; Ziphiidae","behavior; color; species occurrence; whale; Auckland; Australasia; Eastern Hemisphere; Mahurangi Harbour; New Zealand; North Island; World; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mesoplodon; Mesoplodon grayi; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Baker, A.N., (1999) Whales and Dolphins of New Zealand and Australia: An Identification Guide, p. 133. , Wellington, Victoria University Press; De Boer, M.N., Simmonds, M.P., (2000) Beaked Whales in the Southern Ocean, p. 135. , Unpublished report to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (SC/53/SM8).

Furthermore, red meat and blubber products originating from mysticete minke whales caught in the Antarctic and Northern Pacific are also sold for human consumption. We surveyed mercury and cadmium contamination levels in boiled liver, lung, kidney and red meat products being marketed in Japanese retail outlets. We also analyzed the DNA of these products to obtain information concerning gender and species. Total mercury (T-Hg) and methyl mercury (M-Hg) contamination levels in all the cetacean products were markedly higher in odontocete species than in mysticete species, and slightly higher in females than in males. T-Hg contamination in the organs was seen in the following order: boiled liver > boiled kidney=boiled lung > red meat. In particular, T-Hg concentrations in the boiled liver were high enough to cause acute intoxication even from a single ingestion: the mean ±SD (range) of T-Hg was 388±543 (0.12-1980) μg/wetg. In contrast, although M-Hg contamination in the liver was not markedly higher than that in other organs, M-Hg contamination was in the following order: boiled liver > odontocete red meat > boiled kidney > boiled lung. The contamination levels of T-Hg and M-Hg in odontocete red meat, the most popular whale product, were 8.94±13.3 and 5.44±5.72 μg/wetg, respectively. These averages exceeded the provisional permitted levels of T-Hg (0.4 μg/wetg) and M-Hg (0.3 μg/wetg) in marine foods set by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare by 22 and 18 times, respectively, suggesting the possibility of chronic intoxication by T-Hg and M-Hg with frequent consumption of odontocete red meat. Cadmium contamination levels in boiled liver, kidney and lung were 8.59±12.0, 10.4±8.6 and 1.66±1.27 (μg/wetg), respectively. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Mathematics, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7701, South Africa","As a first step in investigating the major predator-prey interactions in the Antarctic, a model describing blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, minke whales Balaenoptera acutomstrata and krill Euphausia superba is developed. Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20th century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration.","Antarctic; Blue whale; Krill; Minke whale; Multispecies model; Predator-prey interaction","ecological modeling; food availability; interspecific competition; population dynamics; predator-prey interaction; Antarctica; Arctic and Antarctic; World; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausia; Euphausia superba; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Musculus; Mysticeti",,,,,,,"Armstrong, R.S., McGehee, R.A., Competitive exclusion (1980) Am.

This article introduces an extended and generalized hazard probability model without the need for such an assumption. The proposed method needs a survey design with independent observers having the same visual region and assumes an explicit distinction of simultaneous and delayed duplicates. It can take account of random heterogeneity caused by surfacing behavior as well as systematic heterogeneity by covariate effects. Furthermore, it can be easily extended to cases in which data from incompletely independent observers are available. The abundance estimate is based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator in unequal detectability sampling scheme. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed method has good performance. The method is applied to a real data set on Antarctic minke whales in the illustration.","Abundance estimation of diving animals; Hazard probability model; Incompletely independent observer; Line transect survey","abundance estimation; diving; fauna; line transect; survey design; animal behavior; article; covariance; diving; double platform line transect method; fish school; line transect theory; nonhuman; observer variation; probability; randomization; sampling; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; theory; whale; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Biometry; Diving; Likelihood Functions; Models, Statistical; Population Density; Whales; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transaction on Automatic Control, AC-19, pp. 716-723; Alpizar-Jara, R., Pollock, K.H., A combination line transect and capture-recapture sampling model for multiple observers in aerial surveys (1996) Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 3, pp. 311-327; Borchers, D.L., Buckland, S.T., Goedhart, P.W., Clarke, E.D., Hedley, S.L., Horvitz-Thompson estimators for double-platform line transect surveys (1998) Biometrics, 54, pp. 1221-1237; Borchers, D.L., Zucchini, W., Fewster, R.M., Mark-recapture models for line transect surveys (1998) Biometrics, 54, pp. 1207-1220; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., (1993) Distance Sampling, , London: Chapman and Hall; Cooke, J.G., An implementation of a surfacing-based approach to abundance estimation of minke whales from shipborne surveys (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 513-528; Cooke, J.G., (2001) A Modification of the Radial Distance Method for Dual-Platform Line Transect Analysis, to Improve Robustness, , Paper SC/53/IA31 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee; Cooke, J.G., Leaper, R., (1998) A General Modelling Framework for the Estimation of Whale Abundance from Line Transect Surveys, , Paper SC/50/RMP21 presented to the IWC Scientific Committee; Huggins, R.M., On the statistical analysis of capture experiments (1989) Biometrika, 76, pp. 133-140; Manly, B.F.J., McDonald, L.L., Garner, G.W., Maximum likelihood estimation for the double-count method with independent observers (1996) Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 1, pp. 170-189; Quang, P.X., Becker, E.F., Combining line transect and double count sampling techniques for aerial surveys (1997) Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 2, pp. 230-242; Schweder, T., Independent observer experiments to estimate the detection function in line transect surveys of whales (1990) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 40, pp. 349-355; Schweder, T., Skaug, H.J., Dimakos, X.K., Langaas, M., Oien, N., Abundance of northeastern Atlantic minke whales, estimates for 1989 and 1995 (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 453-483; Schweder, T., Skaug, H.J., Langaas, M., Dimakos, X.K., Simulated likelihood methods for complex double-platform line transect surveys (1999) Biometrics, 55, pp. 678-687; Skaug, H.J., Schweder, T., Hazard models for line transect surveys with independent observers (1999) Biometrics, 55, pp. 29-36","Okamura, H.; Natl.

Minke whale distribution was not uniform nor random in relation to maximum depth and topography, however, no evident trend was found. The most prominent factor was the presence of underwater sand dunes, where significantly more minke whales were observed than on any other bottom types. Because sand dunes are the favoured habitat of the minke whale major prey in the study area, an indirect link between minke whale distribution, geomorphology and substrate type is suggested.",,"bottom topography; depth; geomorphology; habitat selection; spatial distribution; whale; Canada; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Carscadden, J.E., Frank, K.T., Miller, D.S., Capelin (Mallotus villosus) spawning on the southeast shoal: Influence of physical factors past and present (1989) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 46, pp. 1743-1754; Desrochers, A., James, N.P., Early Paleozoic surface and subsurface paleokarst: Middle Ordovician carbonates, Mingan Islands, Québec (1988) Paleokarst, pp. 183-210. , ed.

Based on coalescent models for mitochondrial DNA sequence variation, the genetic diver sity of North Atlantic whales suggests population sizes of approximately 240,000 humpback, 360,000 fin, and 265,000 minke whales. Estimates for fin and humpback whales are far greater than those previously calculated for prewhaling populations and 6 to 20 times higher than present-day population estimates.

In Norway minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are hunted using small fishing boats rigged with harpoon guns, which fire harpoons tipped with a grenade containing a charge of 30-g penthrite. The grenade detonates 60-70 cm inside the animal. The present study was undertaken to characterize the neuropathological changes caused by the penthrite blast and evaluate its role in the loss of consciousness and death in hunted whales. The study included 37 minke whales that were examined shipboard. The brains were later subjected to gross and light microscopy examination. The results showed that intra-body detonation of the grenade in near vicinity of the brain resulted in trauma similar to severe traumatic brain injury associated with a direct blow to the head. Detonation in more distant areas of the body resulted in injuries resembling acceleration-induced diffuse traumatic brain injury. The authors conclude that even if several vital organs were fatally injured in most whales, the neurotrauma induced by the blast-generated pressure waves were the primary cause for the immediate or very rapid loss of consciousness and death. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

However, it is almost impossible to determine if management efforts have been efficient or if many type II errors have occurred. Applying the precautionary principle to environmental protection without full scientific certainty requires a new academic code for scientists. If we manage ecosystems or bioresources under uncertainty, we need to incorporate new knowledge (accountability) and to change actions with ecosystem states (adaptability). This is called adaptive management. The extinction risk of exploited species under adaptive management is much lower than that under constant exploitation. The revised management procedure (RMP) in whaling and the deer management program in Hokkaido, Japan, share the merit of adaptive management. Under the RMP, the period allowed in considering the extinction risk of the southern hemisphere minke whale is far too long. Population management of over-abundant deer threatened endangered eagles, because of lead contamination from bullets. Although the effect of lead contamination on the extinction risk of eagles was uncertain, the Hokkaido Government prohibited the use of lead bullets in deer hunting. When designing management programs, it is also important to consider cost-benefit measures in the ecological risks. The value of biodiversity is often much higher than the economic benefit from exploiting the bioresource by agriculture, forestry or fisheries.

Samples were analysed by sequencing the D-loop in mtDNA and using 16 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. Muscle samples from a total of 154 minke whales, caught between 6 May and 31 October 1998 by Greenland and Norwegian licensed whalers within 6 areas of the North Atlantic, were analysed (West Greenland, n = 44; Jan Mayen, n = 24; Svalbard, n = 16; the Barents Sea, n = 33; Vesterålen/Lofoten on the coast of northwestern Norway, n = 14, and the North Sea, n = 23). In addition, 30 minke whales sampled in East Greenland during 1996, 1997 and 1999 were included. Furthermore, 122 minke whales caught in West Greenland in 3 different years (1982, 1996 and 1997) were analysed to determine potential inter-annual variation within a sampling area. The lack of inter-annual variation in West Greenland suggests that the minke whales summering in the area year after year belong to the same sub-population. The study indicated the existence of 4 genetically differentiated sub-populations: (1) West Greenland, (2) Central North Atlantic-East Greenland-Jan Mayen area, (3) NE Atlantic (Svalbard, the Barents Sea and northwestern Norway), and (4) North Sea. It is suggested that these sub-populations have been isolated by discontinuities between regions, i.e. each of the sub-populations has evolved in response to regional differences in ecological conditions (oceanography, ice cover, prey type and prey availability).","Acutorostrata; Balaenoptera; Microsatellites; Minke whale; mtDNA; North Atlantic; Population structure","DNA; genetic structure; population structure; whale; (Northeast); Atlantic Ocean; Greenland; North Sea; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Andersen, L.W., Holm, L.E., Siegismund, H.H.R., Clausen, B., Kinze, C.C., Loeschcke, V., A combined DNA-microsatellite and isozyme study of the population structure of the harbour porpoise in Danish waters and West Greenland (1997) Heredity, 78, pp. 270-276; Andersen, L.W., Born, E.W., Gjertz, I., Wiig, Ø., Holm, L.E., Bendixen, C., Population structure and gene flow of the Atlantic walrus, Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, in the eastern Atlantic Arctic based on mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite variation (1998) Mol Ecol, 7, pp. 1323-1336; Annex K, Report of the working group on North Atlantic minke trials (1992) Rep Int Whal Commn, 42, pp. 246-251; Report of the sub-committee on North Atlantic baleen whales, annex F (1993) Rep Int Whal Commn, 44, pp. 115-224; Report of the scientific committee working group on abundance estimates, annex 3.

The levels and relative proportions of OCs were also used to examine the boundaries for North Atlantic minke whale stocks previously defined by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Concentrations of major OC groups (ΣPCB, 89.1-22 800 ng/g lipid; ΣDDT, 65.3-6280 ng/g lipid; ΣCHL, 33.3-2110 ng/g lipid) generally increased from west to east, while HCH concentrations (ΣHCH, <1-497 ng/g lipid) showed the opposite trend. Statistical comparison between six regions using sex-adjusted least squared mean concentrations showed that minke whales from the Barents Sea had significantly higher concentrations of ΣPCBs than those from the Vestfjorden/Lofoten, the North Sea, and west Svalbard, as well as significantly higher ΣDDT concentrations compared to west Greenland animals. The differences in concentrations suggest that west and southeast Greenland minkes may represent one group of whales, which are distinct from both the Jan Mayen minkes and those from other IWC defined stocks in northern European waters. Principal components analysis using proportions of 71 PCB congeners and 20 OC pesticides (of total OCs) did not reveal any major differences among groups although minkes from the North Sea were distinguished from those from Greenland waters by higher loadings of more highly chlorinated PCBs and recalcitrant OC pesticides. The general similarity in mean levels of ΣPCBs, ΣDDT and ΣCHL, as well as mean principal components analysis scores, among minkes sampled at Jan Mayen, Svalbard, Vestfjorden/Lofoten, the North Sea and the Barents Sea suggests that the whales are quite mobile and may feed in multiple areas within the northeastern Atlantic.

A small number of mucous neck cells and a large number of chief and parietal cells were observed in the gland. At the body to basal portions of the gland, the ratio of chief cells to other cells seemed to be large compared to the neck portion. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the chief cell had secretory granules with middle level of electron density, and that the parietal cell contained abundant mitochondria and intracellular canaliculi. The proper gastric gland of the Minke whales may appear to secrete large amounts of digestive enzymes and have high digestive activity.","Minke whale; Parietal cell; Proper gastric gland","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; animal; article; cytology; histology; stomach mucosa; stomach parietal cell; ultrastructure; whale; Animals; Gastric Mucosa; Parietal Cells, Gastric; Whales",,,,,,,"Amasaki, H., Daigo, M., Taguchi, J., Nishiyama, S., (1989) Anat.

Particular attention has been given to the effect of carbon dioxide and lactate since the animal is specialised for prolonged dives often in cold water. The molecular basis of the functional behaviour and in particular of the weak interaction with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is discussed in the light of the primary structure and of computer modelling. On these bases, it is suggested that the A2 (Pro→Ala) substitution observed in the β chains of whale haemoglobin may be responsible for the displacement of the A helix known to be a key structural feature in haemoglobins that display an altered interaction with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate as compared with human haemoglobin. The functional and structural results, discussed in the light of a previous study on the haemoglobin from the Arctic whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata, give further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the interactive effects of temperature, carbon dioxide and lactate. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Box 6404, N-9294 Tromsø, Norway","Information on population structure is essential for estimating population demographics and managing the impacts of exploitation of North Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). New approaches including assessment of geochemical signatures in tissues can assist in defining such structure. This study determined regional variations in long-term elemental diagnostics of stock differences among 159 minke whales harvested in West Greenland, the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea in 1998. The diagnostics tested included mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and cadmium (Cd) in various tissues, and the trace and major element composition of baleen. Supporting data was also gathered on δ15N and δ13C and stable lead isotope ratios. For female whales, significant differences in at least one long-term diagnostic element occurred between several areas. Existence of the following population substructure was inferred: (a) West Greenland, (b) a central group represented by whales from Jan Mayen, (c) a northeastern stock encompassing the Barents Sea, Svalbard and coastal Norway, and (d) the North Sea. These groups were consistent with those defined genetically by Andersen et al. [Mar. Ecol., Prog. Ser. 247 (2003) 263]. Males appeared to fall into similar groupings to females but because of smaller sample sizes fewer significant differences occurred between areas. Stable-isotopic values in minke whales suggested lower trophic-level feeding in this species than hitherto suspected, with significant dietary differences between areas. Variations in feeding habits appeared to explain part of the geographical variation in tissue Cd, but not tissue Hg or Se. Differences among elements with a relatively long biological half-life in specific tissues suggested that groups of minke whales have fidelity to certain summer feeding areas at least for several years.

Grossly, granular lesions with caseation and calcification were main pathological signs, and they were restricted to reproductive organs of mature whales. Chronic purulent or granulomatous orchitis was observed by microscopic analysis. Antibodies to Brucella species were detected in the serum samples of 15/40 (38%) of common minke whales and 4/43 (9%) of Bryde's whales. Neither pathological nor serological change was found in the examined sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in the western North Pacific and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). These results strongly suggest that Brucella infection was involved in two species of baleen whales (Mysticeti) in the North Pacific. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The composition of the fatty acids differed between the inner and outer blubber layer. The saturated, the monounsaturated with 20 and 22 carbon atoms and the polyunsaturated fatty acids had higher relative amounts in the inner than in the outer blubber, and the short-chain monounsaturated acids, i.e. with 14, 16 and 18 carbon atoms, had the highest relative amounts in the outer layer. The change in relative concentration was steeper in the outer parts of the blubber than in the inner parts. Whales from the two areas had different fatty-acid profiles in both inner and outer blubber layer, although these differences were smaller than the difference between inner and outer layer. The difference between the whales from the two areas corresponds to the management stocks defined by the International Whaling Commission. Determination of the fatty-acid profile may be used for identification of whale populations. The composition of the fatty acids in the blubber differed from that of the main prey of the whales: sand eel for the North Sea whales and herring for the Norwegian Sea whales. These differences between prey and blubber fatty acids were larger for the outer blubber layer than for the inner.",,"chemical composition; diet; fatty acid; interpopulation variation; stock identification; whale; North Sea; Norwegian Sea; Anguilliformes; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Hypoptychidae; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Ackman, R.G., Eaton, C.A., Jangaard, P.M., Lipids from the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) from North Atlantic waters.

We formulated six Ecosim parameterizations, representing alternative hypotheses of feeding interactions (functional response) between cetaceans and their main fish prey, and examined differences in the predicted responses to simulated harvesting regimes for minke whales and their prey. Regardless of the type of function response formulated, intense fishing on the main fish prey of minke whales had a longer-lasting negative impact on minke whales than when minke whale biomass was removed directly by harvesting. Consumption rate, biomass, feeding time and mortality of minke whales were all sensitive to the type of functional response specified. Inclusion of ""handling time"" limited minke whales consumption at high prey densities and predicted higher consumption at low prey densities; features characteristic of a type II functional response. Predicted decline and recovery rates of minke whales were slower than when consumption rates were not limited. Addition of ""foraging time"" adjustments resulted in more conservative estimates of decline and recovery. However, when ""other mortality"" was linked to time spent foraging, exposure to higher mortality at low prey densities, and reduced mortality at high prey densities resulted in dramatic differences in predicted biomass trajectory. Sensitivity to the ""other mortality"" assumption is important for cetaceans whose predation mortality is only a small proportion of total mortality. Differences in the feeding and biomass dynamics were also observed when prey availability to predators was represented by changes in prey vulnerability, confirming earlier reports that Ecosim predictions are sensitive to this parameter.","Cetaceans; Ecosim; Ecosystem; Functional response; Predator-prey","ecological modeling; fishery management; functional response; predator-prey interaction; whale; whaling; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., Predator responses, prey refuges, and density dependent mortality of marine fish (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 245-257; Anker-Nilssen, T., Barrett, R.T., Krasnov, J.V., Long- and short-term responses of seabirds in the Norwegian and Barents Seas to changes in stocks of prey fish (1997) Lowell Wakefield Fisheries Symposium Series, 14, pp. 683-698. , Forage Fishes in Marine Ecosystems, American Fisheries Society; Beddington, J.R., Beverton, R.J.H., Lavigne, D.M., (1985) Marine Mammals and Fisheries, , Allen and Unwin, London; Blanchard, J.L., Pinnegar, J.K., Mackinson, S., Parameterization of Ecopath models for two ecosystem states in the Barents Sea: High and low capelin (Mallotus villosus) years (2002) CEFAS Science Series Technical Report, 117. , Cefas, Pakefield Road, Lowestoft, Suffolk, NR33 OHT, UK; Christensen, V., Walters, C.J., Ecopath with Ecosim: Methods, capabilities and limitations (2002) Fisheries Centre Research Reports, 8 (2), pp. 79-105. , D.

In the years since both culture and serological analysis have demonstrated that the infection occurs in a wide range of species of marine mammals inhabiting a vast amount of the world's oceans. Molecular studies have demonstrated that the isolates differ from those found amongst terrestrial animals and also distinguish between strains which have seals and cetaceans as their preferred hosts. At the phenotypic level seal and cetacean strains can also be differed with respect to their CO2 requirement, primary growth on Farrells medium and metabolic activity on galactose. Two new species B. cetaceae and B. pinnipediae have been proposed as a result.

Based on data from annual studies, the effects of these ecological changes on the diet and food consumption of the minke whale (Bulaenoptera acutorostrata), an important top predator in the system, were assessed for the period 1992-1999. Following a collapse in the capelin stock in 1992/1993, minke whales foraging in the northern Barents Sea apparently switched from a capelin-dominated diet to a diet almost completely comprised of krill (Thysanoessa sp. and Meganyctiphanes norvegica). The southern region of the Barents Sea represents important nursery areas for the Norwegian spring-spawning herring. Good recruitment to this stock gives strong cohorts and large numbers of young, immature herring (0-3 years old) which serve as the main food for minke whales feeding in the area. Recruitment failure with subsequent weak cohorts seems, however, to reduce the availability of immature herring to such an extent that minke whales switch to other prey items such as krill, capelin and, to some extent, gadoid fish. The annual changes in prey abundance and body condition, measured as a girth and blubber index, were weakly correlated. However, the comparison of minke whales' body condition in years of high and low abundance of immature herring showed that minke whales in the southern Barents Sea, particularly immatures and adult females, were in significantly better condition in years when the abundance of immature herring was high.","Barents Sea; Body condition; Diet; Ecological variations; Minke whales","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Euphausiacea; Gadiformes; Mallotus villosus; Meganycthiphanes; Meganycthiphanes norvegica; Meganyctiphanes norvegica; Thysanoessa; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Report of the Scientific Committee (1993) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 43, pp. 55-228; Report of the Northern Pelagic and Blue Whiting Fisheries Working Group, ICES Headquarters, 26 April-4 May 2000 (2000) ICES Council Meeting, 2000 ACFM 16. , 303 p; Bergstad, O.A., Jørgensen, T., Dragesund, O., Life history and ecology of gadoid resources of the Barents Sea (1987) Fisheries Research, 5, pp. 119-161; Bogstad, B., Haug, T., Mehl, S., Who eats whom in the Barents Sea?

The method was developed because traditional ways of fixing brains are poorly suited to the collection of whale brains. The whole brain was preserved uncut in its meninges and then excised undamaged from the skull at a later opportunity. There was no handling of the brain in the fresh state. Fixation was started within a couple of hours post mortem. All brains were subjected to gross and light microscopy examination. The results showed that both the gross and microscopic architecture of the brains were adequately preserved, with no massive gross or histological changes due to insufficient fixation apparent. The occurrence of fixation artifacts was low. Microscopic examination showed well-preserved cells and myelin in all parts of the brain. We report the mean fixed weight of the minke whale brain as 2741 g, which is the lowest among the baleen whales. The cerebellum constituted 22% of the total brain weight, which conforms to findings in other baleen whales. This in situ method can probably be used without any particular modifications in other whale species and also in large terrestrial mammals. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All strains studied were A-dominant as shown by specific polyclonal sera and this was also confirmed by the mAbs. However, binding patterns in ELISA of mAbs to the specific common (C) epitopes were rather heterogeneous, and for some strains, such as those isolated from striped dolphins, binding of these mAbs was much reduced or negative as had previously been shown for Brucella suis biovar 2 strains. Western blot after SDS-PAGE showed the typical A-dominant strain banding pattern for all marine mammal Brucella isolates, but the average S-LPS size was shorter in many of these compared to reference Brucella abortus strain 544. Thus, S-LPSs of the marine mammal isolates show heterogeneity with regard to their O-PS C epitope content and their average size. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

The status of small cetaceans in the North Sea and adjacent waters has been of concern for many years. Shipboard and aerial line transect surveys were conducted to provide accurate and precise estimates of abundance as a basis for conservation strategy in European waters. 2. The survey, known as SCANS (Small Cetacean Abundance in the North Sea), was conducted in summer 1994 and designed to generate precise and unbiased abundance estimates. Thus the intensity of survey was high, and data collection and analysis methods allowed for the probability of detection of animals on the transect line being less than unity and, for shipboard surveys, also allowed for animal movement in response to the survey platform. 3. Shipboard transects covered 20 000 km in an area of 890 000 km2. Aerial transects covered 7000 km in an area of 150 000 km2. 4. Three species dominated the data. Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena were encountered throughout the survey area except in the Channel and the southern North Sea. Whitebeaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris and minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata were found mainly in the north-western North Sea. 5. Phocoena phocoena abundance for the entire survey area was estimated as 341 366 [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 260 000-449 000]. The estimated number of B. acutorostrata was 8445 (CV = 0.24; 95% CI 5000-13 500). The estimate for L. albirostris based on confirmed sightings of this species was 7856 (CV = 0.30; 95% CI = 4000-13 000). When Atlantic whitesided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus and Lagenorhynchus spp. sightings were included, this estimate increased to 11 760 (CV = 0.26; 95% CI 5900-18 500). 6. Shortbeaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis were found almost exclusively in the Celtic Sea. Abundance was estimated as 75 450 (CV = 0.67; 95% CI = 23 000-149 000). 7. Current assessments and recommendations by international fora concerning the impact on P. phocoena of bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the North Sea and adjacent waters are based on these estimates.","Conservation; Line transect sampling; Management; Minke whale; Phocoena phocoena; Shortbeaked common dolphin; Sightings survey; Whitebeaked dolphin","abundance estimation; cetacean; conservation planning; line transect; North Sea; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Mammalia; Phocoena; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"(1997) Report of the Second Meeting of Parties to ASCOBANS, 17-19 November 1997, , ASCOBANS Secretariat, Bonn, Germany; Barlow, J., Harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, abundance estimation for California, Oregon and Washington.

To determine the minimum number of individual whales for sale, genotypes from six microsatellite loci were used to profile North Pacific (NP) minke whale products purchased on these markets between December 1997 and October 1999. Genotype differences showed that 99 NP minke whale products from the Japanese market represented 86 unique individuals. Of these, 33.7% were of likely J-stock origin based on mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes. In Korea, genotyping showed that 23 NP minke products from March 1999 represented 18 individuals, and 19 products from October 1999 represented 16 individuals. No matches were found between the two sampling periods, giving a total of 34 unique individuals. A frequency-of-capture model suggests that 98 minke whales were present on the Korean market over the two brief sampling periods. No genotype matches were confirmed between the two countries, indicating that undocumented exploitation of this depleted stock must be additive, and greater than previously assumed. © 2002 The Zoological Society of London.",,"commercial species; endangered species; exploitation; genotype; whale; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Korea; World; Balaenoptera; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,,,,,,"Abe, H., Goto, M., Palsbøll, P., Pastene, L., Preliminary microsatellite analyses of western North Pacific minke whales, Balaenoptera acuturostrata (1997), Unpublished report to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (SC/49/NP12).

G5H 3Z4, Canada","Capelin (Mallotus villosus) tridimensional distribution at the head of the Laurentian Channel in the St. Lawrence estuary was investigated using 38- and 120-kHz acoustic surveys in the summers of 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998. The results are interpreted with the help of a high-resolution tridimensional tidal circulation model. Total biomasses were small (93-4583 t) and showed rapid fluctuations, whereas mesoscale distribution was more constant. Capelin tended to occupy the very end of the channel head, especially the slopes and shallows surrounding the basins. This pattern did not coincide with the krill distribution, but the two total biomass series were significantly correlated. Capelin tidal dynamics is characterized by herding of capelin against the channel head slopes by the starting flooding currents, followed by an upwelling over the sills and shallows during maximum flood currents, and a return to the channel by the surface outflow during ebb. Each side of the channel head has a distinct capelin retention tidal cycle involving passive advection, swimming, and the two-layer estuarine circulation. This capelin distribution and tidal dynamics closely match the local fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) distributions observed from the whale-watching fleet and typical tidal feeding strategies at the channel head.",,"aggregation behavior; estuarine environment; spatial distribution; tidal cycle; upwelling; Canada; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Euphausiacea; Mallotus villosus",,,,,,,"(2000) Etude socio-économique d'un secteur retenu pour l'identification d'une zone de protection marine pilote: Estuaire du Saint-Laurent, , Tecsult Environment Inc.

Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand","From 1996 to 1999, 1422 sightings of cetaceans were recorded by observers on tour boats in the fiords and off the coast of Fiordland. These were compiled by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. Only 2.9% of the sightings were collected outside of Milford and Doubtful Sounds since most of the sampling effort was concentrated in these two fiords. In addition to species identification, group size and location were also recorded. Nine species were identified: bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops sp.), dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), common dolphin (Delphinus sp.), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala malaena edwardi), orca (Orcinus orca), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and sperm whale (Physeter catodon). These are the first official records of long-finned pilot whale and minke whale in the region. Bottlenose dolphins were the most commonly observed species in all areas (87.8% of all sightings), followed by dusky dophins (10.3%). Along the coastline outside the fiords, bottlenose dolphins were also the predominant species (48.1% of sightings, n = 27), followed again by dusky dolphin (33.3%). Observations from this sighting network were compared with studies, which used standard sampling techniques, undertaken in the area. Spatial and temporal variations in tour operator sightings were accurate and reliabce. Estimates of dolphin group size were accurate up to 25 individuals. If the group was larger than 25 animals, its size was overestimated by tour operators. Species distribution at a large scale (Fiordland coastline) and small scale (within Doubtful and Milford Sounds) is discussed. Temporal variations in distribution and group size were also assessed; observer bias was taken into consideration.","Abundance estimates; Bottlenose dolphin; Cetaceans; Common dolphin; Dusky dolphin; Fiordland; Humpback whale; Long-finned pilot whale; Minke whale; New Zealand; Orca; Sightings; Southern right whale; Sperm whale","cetacean; observational method; population estimation; species occurrence; New Zealand; Tasman Sea; Animalia; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Coryphaenidae; Delphinidae; Delphinus; Delphinus delphis; Eubalaena australis; Globicephala; Globicephala melas; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus obscurus; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Barr, K., Slooten, E., Effects of tourism on dusky dolphins in Kaikoura (1999) Conservation Advisory Science Notes, 229. , 28 p.

Progesterone was extracted and quantified from blubber samples of minke whale carcasses by radioimmunoassay. Results showed a highly significant difference (almost 60-fold) between blubber progesterone concentrations of anatomically determined pregnant females versus non-pregnant female or male carcasses. The results of the study suggest that the blubber progesterone concentrations might be used to determine pregnancy status in free-ranging whales.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Biopsy; Blubber; Free-ranging; Minke whale; Pregnancy; Progesterone","hormone; pregnancy; reproductive status; whale; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Baker, C.S., Lambertsen, R.H., Weinrich, M.T., Calambokidis, J., Early, G., O'Brien, S.J., Molecular genetic identification of the sex of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

The sample consisted of muscle tissue from 135 minke whales caught in 1998 in 7 different areas: West Greenland, n=44; East Greenland, n=4; Jan Mayen, n=22; Svalbard, n=14; Barents Sea, n=20; Vestfjorden/Lofoten, n=14; the North Sea, n=17. Mean 137Cs levels in whales ranged from 0.298 (SD=0.083) Bq kg-1 wet weight around Svalbard to 1.319 (SD=0.587) Bq kg-1 wet weight in the North Sea. The finding of the highest caesium concentration in minke whales from the North Sea is in accordance with previous findings that 137Cs levels in the marine environment of the North Atlantic region decrease with increasing distance from major point sources (i.e. nuclear-fuel reprocessing plants in the UK and France, and outflow from the Baltic Sea containing 137Cs from the 1986 Chernobyl accident). The mean 137Cs levels in minke whales from Svalbard and the North Sea differed significantly from mean levels in the other areas. This difference supports the indications from other studies that groups of minke whales are resident for some time at their feeding grounds in the North Atlantic and may occur in separate stocks during summer.",,"bioaccumulation; cesium isotope; radioactive pollution; whale; (Northeast); Atlantic Ocean; Barents Sea; Davis Strait; North Sea; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,,,,"MiljÃ¸ministeriet

Herring spawn along the western coast of Norway, and the larvae are transported northwards to coastal areas of the southern Barents Sea where they spend their first two to four years. The abundance of immature herring year classes in the Barents Sea has been highly variable. One or a few strong year classes are usually followed by several poor year classes. In the study period, there were two particularly strong year classes (1991 and 1992). By 1996, these year classes had migrated out of the Barents Sea, and the abundance of young herring consequently decreased. In the period 1992-1999, the mean annual consumption of immature herring by minke whales in the southern Barents Sea varied considerably (640-118 000 t). The major part of the consumed herring belonged to the strong 1991 and 1992 year classes and there was a substantial reduction in the dietary importance of herring to whales after 1995, when a major part of both the 1991 and 1992 year classes migrated out of the Barents Sea. In 1992-1997, minke whales may have consumed 230 000 and 74 000 t, corresponding to 14.6 and 2.8 × 109 individuals of the herring year classes of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The dietary importance of herring to whales appeared to increase in a non-linear relation with herring abundance. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","Herring; Minke whale; Northeast Atlantic; Predation","clupeoid; diet; predation; whale; Barents Sea; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clupea harengus; Clupea harengus",,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 113485/122","Sincere thanks to Alf Harbitz, Kjell T.

Observations of whale-swimmer interactions over five seasons indicate that initiation and maintenance of contact with vessel and swimmers is largely voluntary and thus the swim programs can comply with the general principle that the whales control the initiation and nature of interactions. Preliminary data on within-season (13 whales in 1999) and between year (four whales from 1999 in 2000, 2001) re-sightings within the study area suggest that any impacts from swim programs may affect a particular subset of the population. The extent of possible cumulative effects can be assessed by continuation of the existing photo and video-ID program. No signs of aggression have been documented but some behaviour (bubble blasts, jaw gape) could be considered as threat display. More detailed analysis of behaviour is necessary to monitor such behaviour. A risk analysis is given for aspects of the interactions, with suggested research to monitor such risks.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Behaviour; Ecotourism; Management; Minke whale; Swimwith- whales programs; Whale-watching",,,,,,,"We thank our colleagues on Undersea Explorer, particularly M.

The eye-lens nucleus was dissected out and the relative amount of D- and L- enantiomers of aspartic acid measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A racemization reaction changes the D/L aspartic acid relationship in the nucleus over time. The age of each whale was estimated using the racemization rate for fin whales along with the measured D/L ratio. The minimum age estimated was 0 years, while the maximum was 32 years. The SE of the age estimates ranged from 4.5 to 8.7 years. Age at sexual maturity was estimated to 5.8 (±3.0) years by regressing the number of ovulations versus the age estimate. Using the von Bertalanffy growth model, age at sexual maturity was estimated to 7.8 (±6.0) years, and age at physical maturity to 13 years. These estimates are consistent with other demographic data for the species. No systematic errors in the age estimates were detected, but the racemization rate (2kASP) and initial ratio of D/L should be estimated specifically for minke whales to ensure accurate age estimates using this technique.","Age-determination; Aspartic acid; Minke whale; Racemization","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Andersen, L.W., Born, E.W., Dietz, R., Haug, T., Øien, N., Bendixen, C., (2000) Population structure of Greenland and NE Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) based on sequence variation of the D-loop of mtDNA and NDA microsatellite variation, , Paper SC/52/AS8 presented to the IWC scientific committee, May 2000. 16 p; International whaling commission report 1997-98 (1999) Annual Report of the International Whaling Commission, 51, pp. 1-3; Bada, J., Mitchel, E., Kemper, B., Aspartic acid racemization in narwhale teeth (1983) Nature, 303, pp. 418-420; Brodie, P., Paasche, A., Thermoregulation and energetics of fin and sei whales based on postmortem, stratified temperature measurements (1985) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 63, pp. 415-416; Christensen, I., Age determination of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, from laminated structures in the tympanic bulla (1981) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 31, pp. 245-253; Donovan, G.P., A review of IWC stock boundaries (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue), 13, pp. 39-68; Fagerholm, P., Tengroth, B., Linsen (2000) Oftalmologi, pp. 159-172. , Høyding G., Bergen, Norway: Studia; George, J.C., Bada, J., Zeh, J., Scott, L., Brown, S.E., O'Hara, T., Suydam, R., Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) via aspartic acid racemization (1999) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 571-580; Jonsgård, Å., (1992) Den norske vågehvalfangsten, , Sandefjord, Norway.

Sixteen prey species consisting of 1 copepod, 4 euphausiids, 1 squid, and 10 fishes were identified. The minke whale in the Northwestern Pacific is a swallowing, feeding-type species. It feeds on swarming zooplankton and schooling fishes, suggesting that minke whales pursue single prey-species aggregations. The results showed geographical and seasonal changes of prey species. On the Pacific side of Japan, Japanese anchovy was the most important prey species in May and June, while Pacific saury was most important in July and August. Walleye pollock was also an important prey species during June and September in coastal waters, over the continental shelf. In the southern Okhotsk Sea krill was the most important prey species in July and August. These changes probably reflect changes in the availability of the prey species in these areas. It would seem that there might be direct competition between minke whales and the fishery for Pacific saury. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Free oligosaccharides were separated by gel filtration and then neutral oligosaccharides were purified by preparative thin layer chromatography and gel filtration, while acidic oligosaccharides were purified by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their structures were determined by 1H-NMR. In one of the Minke whale milk samples, lactose was a dominant saccharide, with Fuc(α1-2)Gal(β1-4)Glc(2′-fucosyllactose), Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc(lacto-N-neotetraose), GalNAc(α1-3)[Fuc(α1-2)]Gal(β1-4)Glc(A-tetrasaccharide), Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4) Glc (para lacto-N-neohexaose), Neu5Ac(α2-3)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc (sialyl lacto-N-neotetraose), Neu5Ac(α2-6)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc (LST c) and Neu5Ac(α2-3)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc (β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc (sialyl para lacto-N-neohexaose) also being found in the milk. The second Minke whale sample contained similar amounts of lactose, 2′-fucosyllactose and A-tetrasaccharide, but no free sialyl oligosaccharides. Sialyl lacto-N-neotetraose and sialyl para lacto-N-neohexaose are novel oligosaccharides which have not been previously reported from any mammalian milk or colostrum. These and other oligosaccharides of Minke whale milk may have biological significance as anti-infection factors, protecting the suckling young against bacteria and viruses. The lactose of Minke whale milk could be a source of energy for them. The beluga whale milk contained trace amounts of Neu5Ac(α2-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc(3′-N-acetylneuraminyllactose), but the question of whether it contained free lactose could not be clarified. Therefore, lactose may not be a source of energy for suckling beluga whales. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J0P 1H0, Canada","Reeves, R.R., Okapi Wildlife Associates, 27 Chandler Lane, Hudson, Que. J0P 1H0, Canada","The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes aboriginal subsistence whaling to be distinct from commercial whaling, and these two broad categories of whaling are subject to different management approaches. This paper describes recent, ongoing and likely future whale hunts that qualify, or may qualify, for aboriginal subsistence status within the IWC's management framework. To ensure conservation of the whale populations, a forthright exposition of the origins, development and character of these hunts is needed in addition to stock assessment, a risk-averse catch limit algorithm and appropriate mechanisms within the whaling communities to ensure compliance. The hunts for Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) and Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Arctic and North Pacific, respectively, and Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in Indonesia have long histories and local origins. Those for Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Lesser Antilles and at Tonga in the South Pacific were introduced by foreign commercial whalers. Whale hunting in the Philippines appears to have originated both locally and as a result of foreign influence. The relatively recent initiation of whaling for Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland required introduced technology but can be viewed as a modern adaptation of an ancient tradition. Consensus in deciding how to classify and manage non-industrial whaling has been, and will remain, elusive. Even with common definitions of key terms such as 'subsistence', 'commercial' and 'aboriginal', interpretations will depend on whether one's priorities are whale-centred or human-centred.","Bowhead Whale; Bryde's Whale; Conservation; Fin Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Minke Whale; Sperm Whale; Whales; Whaling","commercial activity; conservation management; subsistence; whale; whaling; Balaena mysticetus; Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae; Eschrichtius robustus; Eschrichtius robustus; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Physeter catodon; Physeter macrocephalus; Physeteridae",,,,,,,"Adams, J.E., Historical geography of whaling in Bequia Island, West Indies (1971) Caribbean Studies, 11, pp. 55-74; Adams, J.E., Shore whaling in St Vincent Island, West Indies (1973) Caribbean Quarterly, 19, pp. 42-50; Adams, J.E., Primitive whaling in the West Indies (1975) Sea Frontiers, 21, pp. 303-313; Adams, J.E., Last of the Caribbean whalemen (1994) Natural History, 103 (11), pp. 64-71; Aguilar, A., Aboriginal whaling off Pagalu (Equatorial Guinea) (1985) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, 35, pp. 385-386; Akimichi, T., Asquith, P.J., Befu, H., Bestor, T.C., Braund, S.R., Freeman, M.M.R., Hardacre, H., Takahashi, J., (1988) Small-Type Coastal Whaling in Japan.

High densities of minke whales and large aggregations of euphausiids were observed along the ice edge over the continental slope in the southeast region of area IV and in the southwest region of area V. The results suggest that the continental slope zone that coincides with the ice edge would be an important minke whale feeding area. Minke whales were rarely sighted in the offshore region even if euphausiids were abundant. Distributions of humpback whales were correlated with high euphausiid density zones, regardless of the bottom topographic features. Several groups of blue whales were sighted in the small area along the ice edge where euphausiids were abundant, but sightings were too few to draw any general conclusion about the relationship between blue whales and euphausiids. Both baleen whales and euphausiids were scarce in the area east of 170°W where sea ice covered the continental shelf and slope zone.",,"acoustic survey; predator-prey interaction; spatial distribution; whale; zooplankton; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Euphausiacea; Euphausiacea; Mammalia; Megaptera; Mysticeti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha",,,,,,,"(1986) Post-FIBEX Acoustic Workshop.

Using the multiple logistic regression, sightings of cetaceans during the 1990-1996 summer (June-September) surveys were modeled with oceanographic (sea surface temperature, monthly probability of front occurrence) and topographic (depth, slope) variables for the same period. Predicted habitat maps for June and August were created for each species using a Geographical Information System. The predicted habitat locations matched with current and historic cetacean sighting locations. The model also predicted habitat shifts for some species associated with oceanographic changes. The correct classification rate of the prediction models with 1997-1998 summer survey data ranged from 44% to 70%, of which most of the misclassifications were caused by false positives (i.e., absence of sightings at locations where the models predicted).","Cetaceans; Geographical Information System; Habitat prediction model; Western North Atlantic Ocean","cetacean; GIS; model; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; (North); Atlantic Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Stenella (Cetacea); Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Au, D.W.K., Perryman, W.L., Dolphin habitats in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (1985) Fishery Bulletin, U.S., 83, pp. 623-644; Ballance, L.T., Pitman, R.L., Cetaceans of the western tropical Indian Ocean: Distribution, relative abundance, and comparisons with cetacean communities of two other tropical ecosystems (1998) Marine Mammal Science, 14, pp. 429-459; Cayula, J.F., Cornillon, P.C., Multi-image edge detection for SST images (1995) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 12, pp. 821-829; (1982) A Characterization of Marine Mammals and Turtles in the Mid- and North Atlantic Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, , Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, University of Rhode Island.

Currently (April 2001), 19 permits, comprising 31 ships and two aircraft, allow whalewatching in the GBRMP. The combined passenger capacity of these craft is 3,238 at any one time (e.g., per day). However, fewer than 15,000 persons were recorded in 'dedicated' whalewatching tours each month during the May - October 'whale-watching' season between 1998 and 2000. Watching M. novaeangliae occurs primarily in the Central and Cairns Sections of the GBRMP, with most activity focused in the Whitsundays. Permitted levels of whale-watching are capped at eight permits in the Cairns Area, and at 11 permits in the Whitsundays. Other tours include: a specialised form of whale-watching involving swimming with B. acutorostrata which is being brought within a limited-entry management regime; one dolphin-watching tour in the Central Section of the GBRMP north of the Whitsundays; and one dugong-watching tour in the Hinchinbrook Region. Because of reported declines in the number of D. dugon on the Great Barrier Reef, this activity is being monitored closely before further permits are granted. Marine mammal watching activities in the GBRMP are managed through a combination of best practices guidelines, codes of conduct, regulations, zoning, wildlife protection areas and permits. The potential for the commercial whale-watching industry to become self-regulating is acknowledged.","Dolphin; Dugong; Dwarf minke whale; Great Barrier Reef; Humpback whale; Tourism; Whale-watching",,,,,,,,"Anderson, P.K., (1997) Commercial Dugong Tourism at Shark Bay.

Cd concentrations in livers of southern minke whale were apparently higher than those in cetaceans from other regions, while Hg concentrations were lower. There were significant positive correlations between body length and concentrations of Cd and Hg in the liver. The concentrations of all trace elements in the skin were lower than those in other cetaceans reported previously. Significant positive correlations between liver and skin were found for Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Rb, Cd, and Cs, implying that the concentrations of these trace elements in the skin reflect those of internal organs. Large interannual variation of the accumulation pattern of trace elements in the skin was observed for the southern minke whales from Area V. There were significant differences in the skin element concentrations among Areas III, IV, and V, especially for males. Also, discriminant analysis between geographically two different groups collected during 1995/1996 austral summer season, based on the concentrations of trace elements in the skin, allowed for a correct classification of 90% of these minke whales. These results suggest that measurement of trace elements in skin samples could provide valuable information on the status of contamination and possible geographic differences in the accumulation levels in southern minke whales.

Observers scanned for cetaceans with 25x (Big Eye) binoculars from the flying bridge (platform height = 12m) at survey speeds of 18.5-22 km h-1 (10-12 knots). Transect survey effort was 1761 km in 1999, in a study area 196,885 km2; and 2194 km in 2000, in a study area 158,561 km2. An additional 609 and 402 km of trackline was surveyed in 1999 and 2000, respectively, while in transit to or from pollock survey way points. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were the most common large whale, and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) the most common small cetacean in both regions. In the CEBS (1999), uncorrected cetacean abundance estimates were: 3368 (CV = 0.29) fin whales, 810 (CV = 0.36) minke whales (B. acutorostrata), 14,312 (CV = 0.26) Dall's porpoise and 693 (CV = 0.53) harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). In the SEBS (2000), uncorrected abundance estimates were: 683 (CV = 0.32) fin whales, 102 (CV = 0.50) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), 1003 (CV = 0.26) minke whales, 9807 (CV = 0.20) Dall's porpoise and 1958 (CV = 0.21) harbor porpoise. These are the first estimates of cetacean abundance that can be directly compared between two regions of the eastern Bering Sea. Distributions of some species were associated with bathymetric features, and there were occasions when prey associations were obvious. For example, in the SEBS, fin whales occurred on the Middle Shelf (50-100 m) and on the Outer Shelf (100-200 m) near the Pribilof canyon, but in the CEBS fin whales occurred primarily on the Outer Shelf along the 200 m isobath (i.e. the Green Belt). Fin whales were sometimes associated with echo-sounder backscatter from a mixture of fish schools and zooplankton. Humpback whales were also seen on the Middle Shelf, near the 50-m contour where the Inner Front often develops. Non-pollock echosigns observed near cetaceans, some of which may have been cetacean prey, were not routinely identified during trawl sampling because the research focus was on pollock abundance assessment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We investigated the effects of different concentrations (0, 10 and 20%) of fetal whale serum (FWS) in maturation medium on nuclear maturation, morphological grade (A or B) of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) obtained from prcpubertal and adult minke whales. Grade A (≥5 layers of cumulus cells) COC collected from the adult whales and cultured in the medium with 20% FWS had a higher (P < 0.05) maturation rate (31.8%) than those in the medium without FWS (0%). Adding FWS to the maturation medium significantly (P < 0.01) improved the proportion of oocytes at Metaphase II (M-II): without FWS (7.9%), with 10% (19.4%) and 20% (21.4%) FWS. However, sexual maturity of whales and COC grades were not significantly affected by M-II oocytes. When in vitro fertilization of matured oocytes was performed in the presence of 20% FWS or 0.6% BSA in the fertilization medium the proportions of sperm penetration and two-pronuclei formation in matured oocytes were not significantly different. Grade A COC cultured in a culture medium supplemented with 10% FWS cleaved at a higher rate (15.4%, P < 0.05) than did Grade A and B COCs cultured in the medium without FWS (0%). Neither Grade A nor B COCs cleaved when the medium was without FWS. The proportions of cleaved oocytes increased (P < 0.05) with FWS supplementation (6.9% and 8.1% for 10% FWS and 20% FWS, respectively). Grade A COC was significantly (P < 0.05) superior in its ability to cleave (14.5%) and develop to morula (4.2%) compared with that of the oocytes from Grade B COC (2.5% and 0%). Coculture with granulosa cells during in vitro culture did not significantly affect cleavage and development to the morula stage. These results indicate that FWS addition in the maturation medium improved the rate of in vitro maturation and cleavage after insemination of minke whale oocytes. The BSA supplementation in fertilization medium was as effective as FWS supplementation for in vitro fertilization of matured oocytes. In vitro embryo production beyond the morula stage of minke whale oocytes could be possible, if Grade A COC was selected and cultured in the maturation medium supplemented with 10% or 20% FWS. © 2001 by Elsevier Science Inc.","Co-culture;

Significant differences in surfacing intervals were noted both throughout the day and throughout the year. Surfacing intervals were shortest at noon and in the months of June and July. Surfacing intervals were longest both mid-morning and mid-afternoon and during May and August. Differences in surfacing intervals were interpreted to be thc result of ecological changes such as different foraging strategies.

Box 615, Port Douglas, QLD 4871, Australia","A recently described population of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) offered a unique opportunity to study its acoustic behavior. The often-inquisitive dwarf minke whale is seen on the Great Barrier Reef nearly coincident with its suspected calving and breeding seasons. During drifting encounters with whales, a towed hydrophone array was used to record sounds for subsequent localization of sound sources. Shipboard and in-water observers linked these sounds to the closely circling minke whale. A complex and stereotyped sound sequence, the ""star-wars"" (SW) vocalization, was recorded during a series of visual and acoustic observations. The SW vocalization spanned a wide frequency range (50 Hz-9.4 kHz) and was composed of distinct and stereotypically repeated units with both amplitude and frequency-modulated components. Broadband source levels between 150 and 165 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m were calculated. Passive acoustic studies can utilize this distinct vocalization to help determine the behavior, distribution, and movements of this animal. While the SW vocalization's function remains unknown, the regularly repeated and complex sound sequence was common in low latitude, winter month aggregations of minke whales. At this early stage, the SW vocalization appears similar to the songs of other whale species and has characteristics consistent with those of reproductive advertisement displays. © 2001 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic waves; Hydrophones; Ocean habitats; Reefs; Sound recording; Sound stages; Visualization; Stereotyped sounds; Underwater acoustics; communication; vocalization; whale; acoustics; article; breeding; nonhuman; observation; priority journal; vocalization; whale; Animal Communication; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Echolocation; Visual Perception; Vocalization, Animal; Whales; Australia",,,,,,,"Arnold, P.W., Occurrence of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) on the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia (1997) Rep.

Atlantic white-sided dolphin was the most abundant species in the region with a total of 6317 animals recorded. Harbour porpoise was the most frequently sighted cetacean species. The geographical distribution of sightings indicate that cetacean species have varying ecological requirements, with species such as sperm whale, pilot whale and white-sided dolphin favouring deep water off the continental shelf edge, while minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise were apparently limited to the continental shelf. The diversity of species recorded in the region suggests that the Atlantic Frontier is an important habitat for cetaceans. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Atlantic Frontier; Cetaceans; Continental shelf; Distribution; North-east Atlantic; Scotland; Surveys","biological survey; cetacean; geographical distribution; species diversity; species occurrence; Atlantic Ocean; United Kingdom; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera borealis; Balaenoptera physalus; Bidens; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Delphinus delphis; Globicephala melas; Grampus griseus; Hyperoodon ampullatus; Lagenorhynchus; Lagenorhynchus acutus; Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Macrocephalus; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mesoplodon bidens; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Phocoena phocoena; Phocoenidae; Physeter catodon; Tursiops truncatus; Ziphiidae",,,,,,"This work was sponsored by both the Government and members of the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network.

Plasma FSH and LH levels in female minke whales were higher (P&lt;0.05) than in male whales. Although the pituitary weight was not significantly different between male and female whales, pituitary FSH and LH levels were higher in females than in males (P&lt;0.01) and mature whales than immature whales (P&lt;0.05). Plasma levels of FSH, T and E2 were not significantly different between immature and mature male whales, but plasma LH and pituitary FSH and LH levels were higher (P&lt;0.05) in mature than in immature whales. In both immature and mature whales regardless of gender, pituitary FSH and LH levels were correlated significantly (r=0.69: P&lt;0. 01). In mature male whales, plasma T and E2 levels (r=0.60: P&lt;0.01), and testis weight and plasma T levels (r=0.46: P&lt;0.05) were correlated. In immature female whales, plasma FSH and LH levels were highly correlated (r=0.68: P&lt;0.001), but were not for mature female whales. The results show that gender and maturity influence gonadal and pituitary function of minke whales during the feeding season. © 2001 by Elsevier Science Inc.","FSH; LH; Minke whales; Pituitary; Steroid hormone","estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; progesterone; testosterone; age; animal; animal experiment; Antarctica; article; correlation function; enzyme immunoassay; feeding behavior; female; follitropin blood level; hypophysis; luteinizing hormone blood level; male; nonhuman; pregnancy; progesterone blood level; reproduction; season; sex difference; statistical model; testosterone blood level; whale; Age Factors; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Estradiol; Feeding Behavior; Female; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Linear Models; Luteinizing Hormone; Male; Pituitary Gland; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Reproduction; Seasons; Sex Factors; Testosterone; Whales; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,"Estradiol, 50-28-2; Follicle Stimulating Hormone, 9002-68-0; Luteinizing Hormone, 9002-67-9; Progesterone, 57-83-0; Testosterone, 58-22-0",,,,,"Atkinson, S., Combelles, C., Vincent, D., Nachtigall, P., Monitoring of progesterone in captive female false killer whales, (Pseudorca crassidens) (1999) Gen Comp Endocrinol, 115, pp. 323-332; Best, P.B., Seasonal abundance, feeding, reproduction, age and growth in minke whales off Durban (with incidental observations from the Antarctic) (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 759-786; Fakunding, J.L., Tindakk, D.J., Dedman, J.R., Mena, C.R., Means, A.R., Biochemical actions of follicle-stimulating hormone in the sertoli cell of the rat testis (1976) Endocrinology, 98, pp. 392-402; Harrison, R.J., Reproduction and reproductive organs (1969) The Biology of Marine Mammals, pp. 253-294. , Anderson HT (ed).

Box 8156 Dep., N-0033 Oslo, Norway","Serum samples were collected from 42 harpooned minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) during commercial whaling off the coast of northern Norway (1997 and 1998) and analyzed for serum chemistry parameters in order to find clinical reference values for the northeastern Atlantic stock of this species. Mean and median values, as well as standard deviation and 90% central range, are presented for 28 different serum chemistry parameters. Lipemia is a common finding in marine mammals such as the minke whale, and chemical analysis of lipemic serum samples may produce artifacts. We found statistically significant elevated values of total protein, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), sodium and chloride in strongly-lipemic compared to non-lipemic samples, all which may be artifacts due to interference of lipids with the methods used for analysis. In addition, we found significantly elevated levels of creatin kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, uric acid and triglycerides, as well as a decrease in creatinine in the strongly lipemic samples. Reanalyzing serum samples after twelve mo storage at -20 C (n = 13) revealed reduction in the serum concentration of the enzymes ALT (42%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 10%), LDH (19%), gamma glutamyl transferase (17%) and amylase (11%), as well as for triglycerides (9%) and non-esterified fatty acids (16%.). It is crucial that serum chemistry analysis is performed without delay after sampling. Possible changes in the values of some parameters due to the presence of high amounts of lipids or long term storage of samples must be considered when interpreting results from serum chemistry analysis in these animals.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Baleen whale; Cetacean; Clinical serum chemistry; Frozen sera; Minke whale; Rorqual","Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia; Mysticeti; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; chloride; creatine kinase; lactate dehydrogenase; lipid; sodium; triacylglycerol; uric acid; animal; animal disease; article; Atlantic Ocean; blood; blood analysis; female; male; whale; Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Atlantic Ocean; Blood Chemical Analysis; Chlorides; Creatine Kinase; Female; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lipids; Male; Sodium; Triglycerides; Uric Acid; Whales",,"Alanine Transaminase, EC 2.6.1.2; Aspartate Aminotransferases, EC 2.6.1.1; Chlorides; Creatine Kinase, EC 2.7.3.2; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.27; Lipids; Sodium, 7440-23-5; Triglycerides; Uric Acid, 69-93-2",,,,,"Allain, C.C., Poon, L.S., Chan, C.S.G., Richmond, W., Fu, P.C., Enzymatic determination of total serum cholesterol (1974) Clinical Chemistry, 20, pp. 470-475; Amador, E., Urban, J., Simplified serum phosphorus analyses by continuous-flow ultraviolet spectrophotometry (1972) Clinical Chemistry, 18, pp. 601-604; (1994) Technicon AXON System, , Methods manual, publication No. TH9-4720-00.

This article presents a novel method for estimating population size from DNA profiles obtained from a random sample of individuals. The underlying idea is that the degree of biological relationship between individuals in the sample reflects the size of the population and that DNA profiles provide information about relatedness. A pseudolikelihood approach is taken, involving pairwise comparison of individuals. The main field of applications is seen to be catch data, and as an example, the method is applied to DNA profiles (10 microsatellite loci) from 334 North Atlantic minke whales. It is concluded that the sample size is too small for the method to give useful results. The question about the required sample size is investigated by simulation.","DNA profiles; Minke whales; Pseudolikelihood","DNA; allele; genetic analysis; population estimation; analytic method; article; biometry; ecology; nonhuman; population; sample; simulation; whale; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"Almudevar, A., Field, C., Estimation of single-generation sibling relationships based on DNA markers (1999) Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 4, pp. 136-165; Billingsley, P., (1995) Probability and Measure, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Buckland, S., Anderson, D., Burnham, K., Laake, J., (1993) Distance Sampling; Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations, , London: Chapman and Hall; Herbinger, C., Doyle, R., Taggart, C., Lochmann, S., Brooker, A., Wright, J., Cook, D., Family relationships and effective population size in a natural cohort of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae (1997) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 54 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 11-18; Report of the Scientific Committee (1997) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 47, pp. 57-121; Nielsen, R., Palsbøll, P.J., Mattila, D.K., Clapham, P.J., Statistical approaches to paternity analysis in natural populations and applications to the North Atlantic humpback whale (2001) Genetics, 157, pp. 1673-1682; Olaisen, B., (1997) Proposed specification for a Norwegian DNA database register for minke whales, , Paper SC/49/ NA1 presented to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission; Olsen, E., (1997) A study of the reproductive potential of North Atlantic minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lacepede 1804) in the period 1972-1979, , Master's Thesis, University of Bergen; Prodohl, P., Loughry, W., McDonough, C., Nelson, W., Thompson, E., Avise, J., Genetic maternity and paternity in a local population of armadillos assessed by microsatellite DNA markers and field data (1998) The American Naturalist, 151, pp. 7-19; Raymond, M., Rousset, F., GENEPOP (Version 1.2) - Population-genetics software for exact tests and ecumenicism (1995) Journal of Heredity, 86, pp. 248-249; Schwartz, M., Tallmon, D., Luikart, G., Review of DNA-based census and effective population size estimators (1998) Animal Conservation, 1, pp. 293-299; Seber, G.A.F., (1982) The Estimation of Animal Abundance and Related Parameters, 2nd edition, , London: Charles Griffin; Skaug, H., (1999) Whale abundance estimated from genetic relationships between individuals in catches, , Paper SC/51/O8 presented to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission; Thompson, E.A., (1986) Pedigree Analysis in Human genetics, , Baltimore, Maryland; Johns Hopkins University Press","Skaug, H.J.; Institute of Marine Research, Box 1870 Nordnes, 5817 Bergen, Norway; email: skaug@Imar.no",,,"Biometric Society",,,,,0006341X,,BIOMA,"11550924","English","Biometrics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034876391

Cryopreserved minke whale oocytes and spermatozoa do not fertilise in a standard IVF. This study was conducted to investigate the pronucleus formation ability of cryopreserved minke whale oocytes and their subsequent development following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In experiment 1, frozen-thawed minke whale immature oocytes were cultured for in vitro maturation (IVM) in a maturation medium (TCM199) supplemented with either porcine follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH)/estradiol-17β (E2) or pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). After 120 h of IVM, oocyte survival was examined before ICSI, and showed no significant difference in morphological normality (24-36%) between the two IVM media. Two-cell embryos (two oocytes from 21 sperm-injected oocytes) were obtained when the maturation medium was supplemented with pFSH/E2 or PMSG/hCG. In experiment 2, cryopreserved maturing oocytes were investigated for the effects of repeat-culture (2 h or 24 h) on survival before ICSI. Pronuclear formation and development were examined for the effects of sperm pretreatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) and oocyte activation with ethanol at ICSI. A frequency of 49-69% of frozen-thawed maturing oocytes was used for ICSI. Although oocyte activation did not produce a significant difference in survival, pronucleus formation and embryonic development, 2- and 4-cell cleaved oocytes were observed after injection of sperm pretreated with DTT.","Cryopreservation; ICSI; Minke whale; Oocyte","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera bonaerensis; Cetacea; Suidae; dithiothreitol; sex hormone; animal; animal embryo; article; cryopreservation; female; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; male; metabolism; methodology; oocyte; physiology; spermatozoon; whale; Animal; Cryopreservation; Dithiothreitol; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Male; Oocytes; Sex Hormones; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Spermatozoa; Whales",,"dithiothreitol, 3483-12-3; Dithiothreitol, 3483-12-3; Sex Hormones",,,,,"Asada, M., Fukui, Y., Effects on fertilization and development by re-culture after freezing and thawing of bovine oocytes matured in vitro (2000) Theriogenology, 54, pp. 889-898; Asada, M., Horii, M., Mogoe, T., Fukui, Y., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., In vitro maturation and ultrastructural observation of cryopreserved minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (2000) Biol.

The objective is to supplement extensive undersea range and signal processing hardware with state of the art passive marine mammal detection, localization and tracking algorithms. This system will provide the opportunity to determine the number of acoustically active species within an instrumented, open ocean area and to evaluate baseline behavior. The initial system will be demonstrated at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Andros Island, Bahamas. Many of the existing assets at AUTEC will be leveraged, including the data collected by the ongoing marine mammal monitoring program. Undersea range coverage at AUTEC includes a steep island slope feature that may serve as a feeding habitat for several cetaceans including the sperm whale (Physter macrocephalus), short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and several species of dolphins. The development of a database of marine mammal recordings at AUTEC is currently underway using five-minute recordings taken once every half hour. The M3R program is increasing the rate of acoustic data collection at AUTEC and evaluating the ability to passively track the location of various species based on features of the transient acoustic marine mammal calls. Acoustic characteristics of species recorded at the AUTEC as well as developmental marine mammal monitoring algorithms will be presented.",,"Acoustic properties; Acoustic signal processing; Acoustic waves; Algorithms; Computer hardware; Computer software; Database systems; Ocean habitats; Oceanography; Societies and institutions; Dolphins; Marine mammal; Marine mammal monitoring on navy undersea ranges; Minke whale; Short finned pilot whale; Sperm whale; Marine biology",,,,,,,,"Ward, Jessica; Naval Undersea Warfare Cent Div, Newport, Newport, United States",,"IEEE;MTS","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Oceans 2000","11 September 2000 through 14 September 2000","Providence, RI, USA",57860,01977385,,OCNSD,,"English","Oceans Conf Rec IEEE",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034478865

The use of contaminant-induced xenobiotic metabolizers, particularly P450 (CYP) 1A, in marine mammals can be effective as potential biomarkers of the contaminant exposure and/or toxic effects. In this study, we identified the first marine mammalian CYPs. Six novel CYP1A cDNA fragments were cloned from the livers of marine mammal species, minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), largha seal (Phoca largha), and ribbon seal (Phoca fasciata) by the method of reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR); two distinct fragments were from steller sea lion and one fragment each was obtained from the other species. Five of the fragments, one from each species, were classified in the subfamily of CYP1A1, and the other fragment cloned from steller sea lion was designated CYP1A2. Degenerate PCR primers were used to amplify the fragments from liver cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequences of these fragment CYP1As showed identities ranging from 50.0 to 94.3% with other known vertebrate CYPs in the subfamily of CYP1A, including those from fish, chicken, and terrestrial mammals. The isolated fragments were used to construct a molecular phylogeny, along with other vertebrate CYP1A cDNAs cut down in size to the corresponding region of 265 bp in which those newly determined fragments were cloned. This phylogenetic analysis by the maximum parsimony method using the PHYLIP program suggests two distinct evolutional pathways for aquatic mammalian CYP1As, compatible to a conservative taxonomy. Pinniped genes are clustered together with dog gene, forming a carnivore group, and cetaceans form another branch. Identification of CYP1A genes in marine mammals will be an introductory step to provide new insights into the metabolic or toxicological functions of CYP1As in these animals.

The analysis was based on sightings data obtained from the 1989/90 and 1982/83 IWC/IDCR cruises. The mean sea-surface temperatures for comparable areas were significantly higher in 1989/90 (2.04°C) than in 1982/83 (1.12°C), and the area where the sea-surface temperature was greater than 1°C in the 1989/90 study was approximately twice that of the 1982/83 study. Additionally, during the surveys, the extent of the sea ice in 1989/90 was less than that in 1982/83, with the mean ice edge about 92.6 km (50 nautical miles; 1 nautical mile ≃1.852 km) farther south in 1989/90 than in 1982/83. This is consistent with the sea ice extent observed in winter, when the sea ice extent was less in 1989 than in 1982. The distribution of minke whales was substantially different between the two surveys, with the density and abundance of minke whales being greater in 1982/83 than in 1989/90. The warmer sea-surface temperatures, fewer cold-water intrusions, and the smaller extent of sea ice in 1989/90 may be related to the difference in distribution of minke whales from 1982/83, possibly owing to the shift in availability of prey.","Amundsen Sea; Bellingshausen Sea; Climatic warming; Distribution; Minke whale; Oceanographic variability; Sea ice; Sea temperature","environmental factor; population distribution; sea ice; sea surface temperature; seafloor; whale; Amundsen Sea; Bellingshausen Sea",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Fraser, W.R., Sullivan, C.W., Torres, I.J., Hopkins, T.L., Smith W.O., Jr., Antarctic mesopelagic micronecton: Evidence from seabirds that pack ice affects community structure (1986) Science, 232, pp. 847-849; Buckland, S.T., Perpendicular distance models for line transect sampling (1985) Biometrics, 41, pp. 177-195; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., (1993), p. 446. , Distance Sampling, Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations.

We demonstrate this for the case of ancient temperate rainforests and minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). For both rainforests and whales, we determined their value for harvest and balanced this against society's valuation of the preserved stock. For the market and nonmarket data available, we then determined how much rainforest and how many minke whales global society should keep in its asset portfolio. Although ecologists increasingly attempt to justify preservation of biological assets on economic grounds, we argue that this might be a dangerous approach to take. Ultimately, it may be necessary to reexamine the ethical foundations for conservation of nature and biodiversity, including the economist's use of utilitarianism. We suggest that the safe minimum standard approach may prove useful in practice.",,"biodiversity; economics; endangered species; Balaenoptera acutorostrata",,,,,,,"Amundsen, E.S., Bjorndal, T., Conrad, J.M., Optimal harvesting of the Northeast Atlantic minke Whale (1995) Environmetnal and Resource Economics, 7, pp. 167-185; Baskin, Y., Ecologists dare to ask: How much does biodiversity matter?

The maturity of the animals (immature and mature whales) or the presence or absence of cumulus cells (CC) did not affect the proportion of morphologically viable oocytes. Postthawed oocytes were examined for nuclear status after in vitro maturation. The presence of CC (29.1%) significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the proportion of oocytes at metaphase I/anaphase I/telophase I stages compared to results with the absence of CC (13.5%). A total of 4 of 194 postthawed oocytes matured to the second metaphase stage after culture for 5.5 days with or without CC. The cryopreserved immature oocytes obtained from immature and mature whales were processed to examine the ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. Varying ultrastructural damage to the cytoplasm was observed as a result of the cryopreservation procedures.

Minke whale activity was observed from a hillside hut and notes were taken with regard to position and swimming direction throughout each recording. The vocalizations were correlated consistently with the occurrence of minkes and sequential sound levels were commensurate with the whale's relative proximity to the hydrophone. Minke calls were heard in 51% of the recordings examined in detail; calling rates were low (0.1 sounds/min—3.6 sounds/min with multiple individuals). The predominant call was a 0.4 sec downsweep in frequency, beginning at 100–200 Hz (median = 118 Hz) and ending below 90 Hz (median = 80 Hz). The change in frequency was variable, between 20 and 70 Hz (median = 42 Hz). Frequency and temporal characteristics of the vocalizations were similar to those recorded from Antarctic minkes by Schevill and Watkins (1972). Comparisons of the minke downsweeps with those from the closely related finback whale B. physalus, which is also common in the area, indicated that minke whale calls had higher initial frequencies, greater changes in frequency, and shorter call durations. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Acoustic censusing; Baleen whale; Bioacoustics","vocalization; whale; Canada; Balaenoptera acutorostrata",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","William Schevill and William Watkins provided advice and encouragement during preparations for the field work.

During the survey, pulse train sounds were consistently recorded in an area 190-350 km northeast of Puerto Rico. Vocalizing animals were never visually observed, but visual sighting conditions were often poor and observation height was low. Pulse trains occurred in two basic forms. The 'speed-up' pulse train was characterized by an accelerating series of pulses with energy in the 200-400 Hz band, with individual pulses lasting 40-60 msec. Speed-up pulse trains started with average pulse rates of 1.5 pulses/sec, lasted 43.7 ± 6.0 sec, and ended with average pulse rates of 2.8 pulses/sec. The less common 'slow-down' pulse train was characterized by a decelerating series of pulses with energy in the 250-350 Hz band. Slow-down pulse trains started at pulse rates averaging 4.5 pulses/sec, lasted 60.9 ± 5.8 sec, and ended with average pulse rates of 2.9 pulses/sec. We believe the recorded pulse trains are from minke whales based on careful reanalysis of, and comparison to, minke whale pulse-train sounds recorded in the Caribbean by Winn and Perkins (1976).","Acoustic survey; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Minke whale; Pulse train; Sound; Visual survey","acoustic property; vocalization; whale; (Northwest); Atlantic Ocean; Puerto Rico; Balaenoptera acutorostrata",,,,,,,"Au, W.W.L., (1993) The sonar of dolphins, , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Barlow, J., Taylor, B., Preliminary abundance of sperm whales in the northeastern temperate Pacific estimated from a combined visual and acoustic survey (1998) International Whaling Commission Working Paper SC/50/CAWS20; Beamish, P., Mitchell, E., Short pulse length audio frequency sounds recorded in the presence of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (1973) Deep-Sea Research, 20, pp. 375-386; Buckland, S.T., Cattanach, K.L., Miyashita, T., Minke whale abundance in the north-west Pacific and the Okhotsk Sea, estimated from 1989 and 1990 sighting surveys (1991) Report International Whaling Commission, 41, pp. 1-8; Charif, R.A., Mitchell, S.G., Clark, C.W., (1995) Canary 1.2 user's manual.

The animals were killed and collected during the feeding season (December-March) in the Antarctic Ocean in the eastern part of Area III (35°E-70°E, south of 60°S) and Area IV (70°E-130°E, south of 60°S). Blood samples, testes, epididymides, and vasa deferentia were collected from 62 males, which had testes weighing over 400 g each. Changes in testicular morphology and plasma testosterone, estradiol-17β and LH concentrations measured by enzyme immunoassay were investigated. Reduction of testicular function associated with different capture periods was found in the summer season. From December to March, body length and body weight remained steady, but decreases in testicular weight, epididymal weight, and testicular volume were found in February. During the same period, plasma testosterone concentration also declined. A significant decrease in the number of germ cells continued during the period of feeding season. An increase in area of seminiferous tubule tended to proceed in a number of germ cells. These changes reflected the percentage of spermatozoa in the vasa deferentia; in particular, motile spermatozoa were observed in December. Based on morphological observation, spermatogenesis had also declined. These results indicate regulation of testicular function by testosterone, as in terrestrial mammals. A gradual decrease of testicular function occurred during December-January.","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; LH; Minke whale; Season; Spermatogenesis; Steroid hormone; Testis","Antarctic Ocean; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; estradiol; feeding; germ cell; luteinizing hormone; morphology; reproductive biology; seasonality; sperm motility; spermatogenesis; testis; testosterone; reproductive biology; seasonal variation; whale; Antarctica; Animalia; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Mammalia",,,,,,,"Best, P.B., Seasonal abundance, feeding, reproduction, age and growth in minke whales off Durban (with incidental observations from the Antarctic) (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 759-786; Bronson, F.H., Mammalian reproduction, an ecological perspective (1985) Biology of Reproduction, 32, pp. 1-26; Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Jung, Y.G., Terawaki, Y., Miyamoto, A., Ishikawa, H., Fujise, Y., Ohsumi, S., Relationships among morphological status, and steroid hormones and post-thawing viability of frozen spermatozoa of male minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 28-37; Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., Factors affecting in vitro maturation of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Biology of Reproduction, 56, pp. 523-528; Fukui, Y., Mogoe, T., Ishikawa, H., Ohsumi, S., In vitro fertilization of in vitro matured minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) follicular oocytes (1997) Marine Mammal Science, 13, pp. 395-404; Hafez, E.S.E., (1987) Reproduction in Farm Animals, , Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia, 5th edition; Hochereau De Reviers, M.T., Lincoln, G.A., Seasonal variation in the histology of the testis of the red deer, Cervus elaphus (1978) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 54, pp. 209-213; Iga, K., Fukui, Y., Miyamoto, A., Endocrinological observation of female minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (1996) Marine Mammal Science, 12, pp. 296-301; Johnson, L., Tatum, M.E., Temporal appearance of seasonal changes in numbers of sertoli cells, leydig cells, and germ cells in stallions (1989) Biology of Reproduction, 40, pp. 994-999; Kasamatsu, F., Nishiwaki, S., Ishikawa, H., Breeding areas and southbound migrations of southern minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata (1995) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 119, pp. 1-10; Kato, H., Some biological parameters for the Antarctic minke whale (1982) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 32, pp. 935-945; Kato, H., (1986) Study on Changes in Biological Parameters and Population Dynamics of Southern Minke Whales, , Ph.D. thesis, Hokkaido University. 145 pp. (In Japanese); Kato, H., Miyashita, T., Migration strategy of southern minke whales in relation to reproductive cycle estimated from foetal lengths (1991) Report of the International Whaling Commission, 41, pp. 363-369; Kjeld, J.M., Sigurjónsson, J., Árnason, A., Sex hormone concentrations in blood serum from the North Atlantic fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) (1992) Journal of Endocrinology, 134, pp. 405-413; Lockyer, C., Review of baleen whale (Mysticeti) reproduction and implications for management (1984) Reports of International Whaling Commission, (SPEC.

Bovine oocytes were cultured in vitro for 24 h and those with a polar body were selected for ICSI. Frozen-thawed semen from the three species were treated with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h and spermatozoa were killed by storing them in a -20 °C refrigerator before use. ICSI was performed using a Piezo system. Three experiments were designed. In experiment 1, a higher (p < 0.05) male pronuclear formation rate was found in the oocytes injected with ram (52.6%) or bull (53.4%) spermatozoa than with minke whale spermatozoa (39.1%). In experiment 2, sperm head decondensation was detected at 2 h after ICSI in the oocytes injected with a spermatozoon of each species. Male pronuclei were first observed at 4 h in the oocytes injected with ram or bull spermatozoa and at 6 h in oocytes injected with minke whale spermatozoa. The mean diameters of male pronuclei derived from both whale and bull spermatozoa were larger than those from ram spermatozoa (30.4 μm and 28.3 μm vs 22.4 μm, p < 0.005). The mean diameter of female pronuclei in the oocytes injected with whale spermatozoa was also larger than with ram spermatozoa (29.3 μm vs 24.7 μm, p < 0.05). The development of male and female pronuclei was synchronous. In experiment 3, ethanol-activated oocytes injected with a spermatozoon from any of the three species achieved significantly higher (p < 0.05-0.001) cleavage rates than control oocytes. Blastocyst formation was only observed when bull spermatozoa were used. The results of this study indicate that dead foreign spermatozoa can participate in fertilisation activities in bovine oocytes after ICSI.","Bull; ICSI; Minke whale; Oocyte; Ram; Spermatozoon","Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Bovinae; Cetacea; Ovis; animal; article; cattle; cell nucleus; comparative study; female; fertility; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; male; oocyte; physiology; sheep; species difference; spermatozoon; ultrastructure; whale; Animals; Cattle; Cell Nucleus; Female; Fertility; Male; Oocytes; Sheep; Species Specificity; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Spermatozoa; Whales",,,,,,,"Donoghue, A.M., Johnston, L.A., Seal, U.S., Armstrong, D.L., Simmons, L.G., Gross, T., Tilson, R.L., Wildt, D.E., Ability of thawed tiger (Panthera tigris) spermatozoa to fertilise conspecific oocytes and bind and penetrate domestic cats eggs in vitro (1992) J.

A clear difference in densities against the physiographic variables (the sea floor-slope type) was identified between baleen whales and toothed whales. Densities of sperm whales and ziphiids were low in the waters over the continental shelf where minke whales' densities were highest. This led to an apparent negative correlation in the density between minke and sperm whales, and minke whale and ziphiids. A significant positive correlation in density between minke and blue whales was identified. No association in density between minke and humpback whales was observed. Distribution of killer whales shows strong positive correlation with that of minke whales. The positive correlation existed between minke and blue whales, and minke and killer whales even when the effect of environmental variables was excluded. Analysis also revealed that the environmental variables, including physiographic variables, are major factors affecting the distributions and density of whales, especially between baleen whales and toothed whales.",,"Antarctic Ocean; geographic distribution; humpback whale; interspecific relationship; orca; population density; sperm whale; whale; feeding ground; interspecific interaction; population density; whale; Antarctica; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Balaenoptera musculus; Cetacea; Delphinidae; Mammalia; Megaptera novaeangliae; Mysticeti; Odontoceti; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Orcinus orca; Physeter catodon; Physeteridae; Ziphiidae",,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Biomass of birds and mammals in the Ross Sea (1985) Antarctic Nutrient Cycles and Food Webs, pp. 498-515. , Siegfried WR, Condy PR, Laws RM (eds) Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York; Bannister, J.L., Continued increase in humpback whales off Western Australia (1994) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 44, pp. 309-310; Bengston, J.L., Laws, R.M., Trends in crabeater seal age at maturity: An insight into Antarctic marine interactions (1985) Antarctic Nutrient Cycles and Food Webs, pp. 669-675. , Siegfried WR, Condy PR, Laws RM (eds) Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York; Best, P.B., Butterworth, D.S., Report of the Southern Hemisphere minke whale assessment cruise. 1978/1979 (1980) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 30, pp. 257-283; Best, P.B., Ohsumi, S., International Whaling Commission International Decade of Cetacean Research (IWC/IDCR) Southern minke whale assessment cruise 1978/1979 (1980) Polar Rec, 20, pp. 52-57; Brown, S.G., Lockyer, C.H., Whales (1984) Antarctic Ecology, 2, pp. 717-781. , Laws RM (ed) Academic Press, London; Buckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Laake, J.L., (1993) Distance Sampling, Estimating Abundance of Biological Populations, , Chapman & Hall, London; Clapham, P.J., Brownell, R.L., The potential for interspecific competition in baleen whales (1996) Rep Int Whaling Comm, 46, pp. 361-367; Connell, J.H., The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (1961) Ecology, 42, pp. 710-723; Connell, J.H., On the prevalence and relative importance of interspecific competition: Evidence from field experiments (1983) Am Nat, 122, pp. 661-696; Conroy, J.W.H., Recent increase in penguin populations in Antarctica and the subantarctic (1975) The Biology of Penguins, pp. 321-336. , Stonehouse B (ed) University Park Press, Baltimore; Croxall, J.P., Southern Ocean environmental changes - Effects on seabird, seal and whale populations (1992) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 338, pp. 319-328; Gambell, R., Some effects of exploitation on reproduction in whales (1973) J Reprod Fertil Suppl, 19, pp. 533-553; Gambell, R., Report of the Scientific Committee, Annex 0.

Digestion of the prey is initiated by indigenous bacteria in a rumen-like forestomach system. A major structural component of the crustacean exoskeleton is chitin, the β-1,4-linked polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The exoskeletons appear to dissolve completely in the non-glandular forestomach. Bacteria in the forestomach fluid of six krill-eating minke whales were enumerated and isolated using an anaerobic habitat-simulating culture medium. Median viable population densities ranged between 6.0 x 106 and 9.9 x 109 bacterial cells per mL forestomach fluid. Bacterial isolates (n = 44) cultured from the forestomach fluid of one minke whale mainly resembled strains of Eubacterium (25%), Streptococcus (18%), Clostridium (14%), and Bacteroides (11%). As much as 12% of the bacterial isolates were chitinolytic, while β-N- acetylglucosaminidase activity was demonstrated in 54% of the isolates, and utilisation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was observed in 73%. The chitinolytic isolates resembled strains of Bacteroides, Bacteroidaceae, Clostridium, and Streptococcus. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of partly digested krill from the minke whale forestomach revealed bacteria close to and inside the chitinous exoskeleton. The bacterial chitinase may act on the chitinous crustacean exoskeletons, thereby allowing other bacteria access to the nutritious soft inner tissues of the prey, and thus initiating its degradation and fermentation.","Cetacea; Chitinase; Symbiotic microbial digestion; β-N-acetylglucosaminidase","chitin; chitinase; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase; n acetylglucosamine; article; bacterial metabolism; Bacteroides; Clostridium; controlled study; culture medium; digestion; Eubacterium; fermentation; forestomach; nonhuman; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; stomach juice; Streptococcus; transmission electron microscopy; whale; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidaceae; Bacteroides; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Clostridium; Crustacea; Euphausiacea; Streptococcus",,"chitin, 1398-61-4; chitinase, 9001-06-3; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase, 37278-88-9; n acetylglucosamine, 7512-17-6",,,,,"Aagnes, T.H., Sørmo, W., Mathiesen, S.D., Ruminai microbial digestion in free-living, in captive lichen-fed, and in starved reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in winter (1995) Appl.

The records of the Dwarf Sperm Whale and that of the Risso's Dolphin are the first for eastern Canada. The record of the Sowerby's Beaked Whale is the first reported stranding in Nova Scotia. Humpback, Minke, and Killer whales, and Short-beaked Common Dolphins have not previously been recorded stranded on Sable Island. The majority of stranding events (84) were of a single animal; nine involved two animals; eight involved 3-10 animals; and one event involved over 130 animals. Recorded strandings increased from 1.9 strandings/year between 1970-1989 to 7.1 strandings/year between 1990-1998. Mass strandings of multiple male Sperm Whales have occurred three times (all since 1990).
